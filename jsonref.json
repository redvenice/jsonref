Peace between rival camps is the new leader’s big challengeThe Labour party is in turmoil. It has just elected a new leader, Keir Starmer, who campaigned on the basis of party unity and ending factionalism. There was a sense from this result that members wanted a period of calm. But a deeply controversial internal report was leaked over the weekend to journalists and then distributed on social media. The effect has been to escalate factional warfare and intensify the toxic relationships between different groups within Labour.The report is the result of an internal investigation into the work of Labour’s governance and legal unit in relation to antisemitism. Created by party staff, it pulls together an estimated 10,000 emails, thousands of messages exchanged on work accounts, and the contents of two WhatsApp group chats apparently created by senior management in Labour headquarters. However, it will not be submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission that is currently investigating antisemitism within the party, as party lawyers have reportedly decided that it is not within the scope of the external probe.Some have assumed that the document, dated March 2020 and written by staff working in the era when Jeremy Corbyn was leader and his ally Jennie Formby the general secretary, provides evidence that Labour’s antisemitism problem is fictitious. That is not the conclusion of the report. Instead, its primary claim is that disciplinary cases were indeed poorly handled by the party that this was not a mishandling of antisemitism complaints in particular but of all complaints in general and that the situation has improved under Formby.The parts of the document that have gained most attention are those focused on the “hyper-factional” environment existing within party HQ between Corbyn’s election in 2015 and previous general secretary Iain McNicol’s departure in February 2018, according to the report. It paints a truly horrible picture of an atmosphere dominated by politically motivated cruelty. There will be party members who recognise the nastiness of comments from the heated debates in their own local parties. But the report is shocking because the messages are alleged to come from senior staffers. It says the comments made about colleagues include “total mentalist”, “bitch face cow” and “pube head”, while Diane Abbott is mocked for crying in a toilet. There is also evidence that purports to show a staffer hoping that a named young member with mental health issues “dies in a fire”.The other aspect to the factionalism described in the report, putting aside the vitriol, is the hope apparently expressed by anti-Corbyn staffers that Labour would not be electorally successful. The document contends that those in charge of party operations wanted the Liberal Democrats to win the 2017 Manchester Gorton byelection, created a “secret key seats team” to prioritise general election spending in seats held by MPs on the right of the party even when they were “safe”, and were disappointed when Corbyn’s Labour did better than expected in the 2017 general election. The messages in the report show discussion of a “Trot hunt” during the 2015 leadership election to prevent new party members voting for Corbyn.The rest of the report es into the failings of Labour’s disciplinary system, asserting that the unit “did not properly log complaints”, that there was no record of action being taken on serious cases, and that “well-evidenced” antisemitism complaints were dismissed as “spam”. It also sets out the details of particular cases – controversially so, due to the implications for data protection now that it has been leaked.If the Panorama documentary told one side of the Labour antisemitism story, as Corbynites say that it does, this internal report shows the other side. Its claims will undoubtedly also be questioned. An independent investigation into the contents and release of the report has already been announced by Starmer. What is undeniable is that complaints have been mishandled due to a toxic internal culture, and that this has caused deep hurt – to the Jewish community, and to party members who worked hard for the Labour party with little reward.Less than two weeks into his leadership, Keir Starmer has his work cut out. Difficult decisions that will have repercussions for Labour’s future – from procedural changes in HQ to trying to bring about a fundamental shift in party culture – lie ahead.• Sienna Rodgers is editor of LabourList"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71163a21b32737e2c6151a31390bcb16ecce951a/0_0_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab4a5882cec60f04c62e2244d59755d","title":"people work lockdown herd immunity debate coronavirus","story":"So far we haven’t had the evidence to truly judge leaders and their coronavirus policies. With policies easing, we soon willThe trickle is starting. Spain, Austria, Italy, China, possibly Germany and the US will this week begin, however hesitantly, the great return to work. As others hold back and some may even toughen lockdowns, the result will be the most extraordinary mass experiment in history.The outcome should go some way to settle the central argument of coronavirus policy, of lockdown and suppression v mitigation and herd immunity. It will also condition a later political blame game, who was right and who was wrong.Statistics are in chaos. Death “rates” lag behind deaths. Deaths are confused with “hospital deaths”. Headlines highlight “most cases per nation” or “most deaths per nation”, not deaths per million. Yet we are at the mercy of these statistics. They are the raw material of the modellers, and their models are the sacred entrails into which policymakers peer each day, to see what level of lockdown to impose on their people.Not surprisingly, science is giving way to value judgments. Authoritarian regimes are erging from libertarian ones. Countries in total lockdown (Spain and France) are compared with countries practising social distancing (Sweden and Korea) and those such as Turkey and Brazil which do none of those things. As David McCoy said in the  last week, we simply don’t have models that balance “the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown”.I assume that hard evidence will now start to emerge. There will be a wide comparative spectrum, of outliers and controls. We should learn to what degree were face masks and two-metre separation efficacious, as against mass isolation and economic collapse. So far, such evidence is in desperately short supply. Soon it will be on the ground, in the world’s factories and on its pavements.Economics has taken a terrible battering this last month, because it is thought to put “money before lives”. But all options cost lives, which is why political judgment has moved to centre stage. Businesses are ruined, dreams shattered, people die. As in the conundrum of the swerving driver, do you avoid one death now, but is it at the cost of five down the road?The cliche is true. Only time will tell, but that time starts now. The task is to scrutinise the evidence and let it tell the truth, not just the truth we want it to tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f87692d3e80d8404cd335ef0fff6707aa2a7b36/0_0_2782_2803/master/2782.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0f7260c3550a3034abfb7eab7f16f9ad","title":"rachel roddy recipe leftover spaghetti frittata","story":"A locked-down Roman kitchen makes enterprising use of leftover pasta in a moreish spaghetti ‘fry-up’ topped with lots of cheeseHow many people does it take to turn a frittata di pasta? Here, at the moment, two. We discuss (argue) about when exactly, and whether a pan lid or a plate is better for inverting, and which of us used a pan scrub on the nonstick pan. It wasn’t me. Lockdown has concentrated everything, reduced our stocks and patience. It has also concentrated the importance of leftovers, or, as a friend calls them, “leave-that-alone-don’t-eat-it-it-is-for-tomorrow’s-lunch”.With most frittate – potato, asparagus, onion, bottom-of-the-fridge – the ingredients are held together by the egg. With a frittata di pasta, it is the other way round: the egg is held by the pasta. That isn’t to say that the eggs in frittata di pasta aren’t glue – they are, adhering to the strands of spaghetti like mud in a bird’s nest, but without encasing the whole thing. This means that, instead of a heavy yellow frame, the edges are made by the curves of spaghetti which, like snags in a sweater, poke and stick out, toasting as the frittata fries – which is the other difference: while most frittate are soft, frittata di pasta (at least the way we like it) is firmer,  bronzed and has toasted edges.The first way is with no additions: you simply take your leftover spaghetti (let’s say ours is with tomato sauce) and put it into a nonstick pan in which you have heated a little oil, press it down and fry until “arrustacata, ben rosolata e croccante, bruciacchiata” – “well browned and crunchy, scorched”. His description of a seafood pasta arruscata is even better: he heats the leftover pasta first, tossing it around and adding a spoonful of grated pecorino before he presses it into the pan, so the pasta takes on colour and the seafood (I am imagining a fat mussel here) catches and caramelises. This note reminds me of cooking with chef Jeremy Lee, him daring me to fry the rabbit longer, fry the courgette in batter deeper, reminding me that a catching is very often the way to catch flavour, which in turn catches the eater.The second way to make frittata di pasta is to mix the leftover pasta with egg and grated cheese. If you have saved unsauced pasta, you need to be even more diligent with seasoning here.Whereas soft frittate go well with a crisp salad, frittata di pasta with toasted edges demands the opposite: a salad made with floppy eared butterhead lettuce, for example, two of which I have in the fridge. I like a French dressing with a soft green salad: six tablespoons of olive oil, one of vinegar, and one of dijon, shaken in a jar until it is cloudy yellow. Vincenzo likes oil and lemon. Something to “discuss” later.200g day-old, cold spaghetti (plain or with tomato sauce)3 eggs3 tbsp grated parmesan or pecorinoSalt and black pepper3 tbsp diced mozzarella or other melting cheese (optional)Butter and oil, for fryingBreak the eggs into a bowl and whisk. Add the cheese, salt and plenty of pepper, and whisk again. Add the spaghetti and cubed cheese, and stir until the pasta is well coated with egg.Heat a little olive oil and butter over a medium-high flame, until the butter is foaming, tip the mixture into the pan and fry, stirring, for minute.Press down on the mixture to even it out in the pan, turn down the heat to medium and leave to cook for two minutes, then use a plate to invert the frittata and fry on the other side until golden.

Close your eyes and think about what it conjures up for you. For me, it’s Greece, where I once ate a plate of them drowning in a rich tomato sauce, strewn with wild oregano and the most delicious, creamy feta. The sun was slipping behind the hills, bathing an olive tree in a particularly golden light. Did I dream the heavy-laden, long-lashed donkey walking past? I’m feasting off dreams like these at the moment – and on Greek meatballs, which I’ve recreated at home.This recipe is simple and the meat requires no browning.

The 37-year-old is a consistent shot-stopper and has nine clean sheets from 29 games for Watford this season. Without a player of his calibre, Watford would not have climbed out of the relegation zone.Jan Vertonghen may have not had his best season with Tottenham but he has more than 300 Premier League appearances and a fresh start could inspire a return to his best. At the other end of the spectrum José Mourinho has in Japhet Tanganga another talented centre-back whose contract is due to end. The 21-year-old has been one of the few positives from a difficult period at the club. Tanganga withstood a baptism of fire on debut against Liverpool despite switching from right- to left-back in the second half.At right-back, Nathaniel Clyne has fallen so far down the pecking order at Liverpool, some people still think he is out on loan at Bournemouth, where he made 14 league appearances last season. The former Crystal Palace is still only 29 years old and has 14 England caps to his name, so is not a lost cause for any willing clubs. The cupboard looks a little bare at left-back but Christian Fuchs is a Premier League winner with Leicester. The little playing time the Austrian has had this season and last should mean he has plenty in the tank even at 33.Adam Lallana, Jeff Hendrick and John Lundstram. Lallana has featured only in patches for Liverpool but has shown he can drive his team forward. When called on late by Jürgen Klopp he delivered an equaliser against Manchester United to save the leaders’ unbeaten run in October.Burnley’s once-record signing Hendrick scored a game-saving goal of his own against Brighton and a winner against Everton. After a dip Sean Dyche’s team have impressed with Hendrick a key part of the industry that has led to a five-game unbeaten run, their best this season.Lundstram has shone in his first season in the Premier League with Sheffield United. He was the fall guy after Sander Berge signed for a record fee in January but a return to the starting lineup in United’s final game before the shutdown paid off for Chris Wilder. Lundstram’s delicious cross for Billy Sharp was the creative spark needed to beat Norwich.Ryan Fraser admitted in January he had not “played for the team” at Bournemouth in the first half of the season and the left winger’s form has suffered. With a change of scenery he could bounce back. Fraser managed seven goals and 14 assists last season and the lack of such a contribution has been missed by Eddie Howe.Chelsea’s Willian and Olivier Giroud complete a formidable front three. The Brazilian is one of Frank Lampard’s most consistent players, as is his touch, range of passing and delivery from free-kicks. A match-winning double at Tottenham in December showcased his devastating ability. Giroud has been frustrated by Lampard using him sparingly while Tammy Abraham was injured. Giroud finally got a start against Tottenham in February and link-up play was so good it resulted in a goal for himself in Chelsea’s win. Giroud’s header found Mason Mount, who squared to Ross Barkley and the latter’s shot rebounded for Giroud to lash past Hugo Lloris.Nice’s Walter Benítez is the best goalkeeper available, with Gianluigi Buffon on speed dial should he not sign a new deal with Juventus. The Argentinian kept the most clean sheets in Ligue 1 last season with 16. Benítez will need to be on his toes too as Paris Saint-Germain’s attack-minded trio Thomas Meunier, Tanguy Kouassi and Layvin Kurzawa slot into defence with their experienced teammate Thiago Silva. The 17-year-old Kouassi showed his eye for goal with a pair of headers that helped drag PSG to a 4-4 draw with Amiens in February.In midfield Milan’s Giacomo Bonaventura and Bayer Leverkusen’s Charles Aránguiz flank Borussia Dortmund’s Mario Götze. Götze has declined since he won the World Cup for Germany in 2014 but, if he can stay fit, he has a lot to offer at 27.The front three have an eye-watering 811 league goals between them: Napoli’s Dries Mertens, PSG’s Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are up for grabs, assuming the one-year option is not triggered at Milan on Ibrahimovic’s contract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f43f9b1812284f1026e72af7c43e9d380ee5f3/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=594c86a3b3e29b7b146bb82510bc25c3","title":"coronavirus have i already had covid 19","story":"Covid-19 symptoms, when they occur, vary widely and undertesting means many people have probably been unwittingly infectedCovid-19 symptoms vary widely, and undertesting in many countries means that many people may have already had the coronavirus without having received a positive diagnosis. Is it possible to find out, and how should you behave if you think you may have been infected? Dr William Hillmann: Antibody tests are being developed but are not in widespread clinical use yet. The antibody testing would allow us to check blood samples for antibodies against coronavirus to tell whether somebody has had it. I, and I think many others, are anxiously awaiting for those to become available.Hillmann: Coronavirus is actually quite a significant spectrum of symptoms, from people who are entirely asymptomatic and would have no idea that they have it to people with very mild, cold-like symptoms – runny nose, congestion, sore throat – to people with more flu-like symptoms – high fevers, muscle aches, shortness of breath and cough. Loss of smell and taste are also symptoms. All the way up to people with severe illness, who we’re seeing in the hospital with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care. It’s impossible right now to say what the true prevalence of the disease in the US is since we are still prioritizing testing for people who are sick or in the hospital or who are healthcare workers. We’re not doing widespread testing that South Korea and some European countries have done to get a sense of how many people are asymptomatic or have such minimal symptoms that they attribute it to allergies or something else.When people are symptomatic, they’re contagious. A day or two before they become symptomatic, they’re likely contagious as well. A virus builds up and starts to shed, and then after symptoms resolve, people can still be contagious for a couple of days. We have some evidence of viral shed even a couple of weeks after symptoms are resolved. It’s hard to know if that’s actual live virus, which is still able to infect somebody, or if that’s just dead virus that the body is shedding.Dr David Buchholz: We all have to be role models. If we’re all in it together, we all should be doing social distancing.Hillmann: Since there’s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you’re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act as if you hadn’t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene. I think universal mask-wearing in public is a reasonable recommendation based on what we know about the wide spectrum of symptoms, and the fact that people can be asymptomatic and still be shedding the virus.Buchholz: I would, absolutely. I’m in New York, and it was definitely in the community before we knew it. So, yeah, any family members and close friends, maybe somebody you work next to, I think I would just alert them, especially if it was in the last 14 days. If it’s been more than 14 days, they would have gotten sick by now if they had significant exposure.Hillmann: It’s up to every inidual about what they feel is right. That being said, with the surge in infections that we’re seeing in places like New York, if you were symptomatic at one point but were not tested, and you were in close contact with somebody, I think you should tell them.Buchholz: There’s not been any evidence that anyone’s gotten it more than once. Someone with a normal immune system that can react to the virus and get better should have immunity for quite some time, at least a year, if not lifelong.There have been reports out of China suggesting people are testing positive for Covid-19 a second time. Most scientists think it is an issue around the inaccuracy of the testing and not that people are having two separate cases of the disease.Dr David Buchholz, senior founding medical director, primary care, assistant professor of pediatrics, Columbia University Irving medical centerDr William Hillmann, associate inpatient physician director at Massachusetts general hospital"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca47872100e5f7da03447d1b1c6c03fc269e6af6/0_72_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5d8430b972fd509531b8535a2aa7b44d","title":"how we met within hours i knew i would marry her","story":"Santiago and Gisela Klein, 55 and 48, met on a beach in Uruguay in 1994. Originally from Argentina, they now live in HertfordshireIn January 1994, Santiago Klein was taking a break from city life with a beach holiday in Uruguay. “It was a popular place for people living in Argentina to visit. I started talking to Gisela’s sister because she knows my sister,” he recalls. It wasn’t long before the pair were introduced, and he asked if she wanted to go on a date later that day. “I noticed her eyes at first, and I really liked her.” They arranged to go out at midnight. “In Latin America, we go out late and stay out until 5am,” says Santiago. “I went out for dinner with my family first and they asked about my date but I couldn’t remember her name. I just knew there was something about her I really liked.”Keen to impress his date, he admits he was showing off at the start. “At first, I thought he was a bit full of himself, but I soon realised he was really down to earth and lovely,” says Gisela. “I went home and told my mum and auntie that I’d found the man I was going to marry.”Santiago felt the same way. “We had lots in common and wanted the same things in life. In the space of a couple of hours I knew I would marry her.” Though they were both coming out of long-term relationships, something felt right between them. “I had never thought about marriage before and suddenly I just knew,” says Santiago.A few days later, he returned to Buenos Aires for work, while Gisela continued her holiday. “He came back to Uruguay a week later and he proposed,” she says. “We went to a market seller there and he bought the rings.”Gisela was also living in Buenos Aires at the time, and the pair returned to the city together after their travels were over. “I joke that she comes from the posh bit of the city, like Chelsea in London,” says Santiago. “And I am from the equivalent of Hendon.” The couple arranged their wedding for 6 November 1994, exactly 10 months after they met. “We wanted it to be the same day of the month,” he says.Before the wedding, the couple had to tell their parents about their plans. “We went for dinner with my family and we just kept on ordering more food,” says Gisella. “He was so nervous about telling them.” Eventually Santiago plucked up courage. “My father-in-law looked at me, finished drinking his coffee and then said: ‘I knew you would marry her I just thought you’d wait a bit longer.’ They’d only known me for about 15 minutes.”Since they married, the couple have had three children, Freddie, Maggie and Max. They have lived in both the UK and the US, moving around for Santiago’s work in property development while Gisela cared for the children. The first move came in 2001, during a period of riots and instability in Argentina. “Things weren’t good at home, so when Santiago suggested the move I thought ‘Why not?’,” says Gisela. She admits life in the UK was hard at first as she spoke no English and had young children. “Over 10 years, I learned to really love it.”In 2010, the family moved to Florida. “We knew it wasn’t going to be for us long-term,” Santiago says. “We said we needed to move back home but neither of us knew whether that meant Argentina or the UK.”They moved to England again in 2016. As well as having plenty of friends in the UK, Gisela says they love the “fairness” of British society. “It feels like a caring place to live.” But they visit their family in Argentina as often as they can – and at Christmas and New Year they return to the beach in Uruguay where they met.Santiago says their marriage has always felt right. “She complements me so well. And I have always loved the way she smiles with her eyes and not just her mouth.” Gisela has always known that she and her husband were meant to be. “He has lots of regrets in life, but he always says he has never regretted marrying me, not once.”• Want to share your story?

Then I found a bottle of her scent Over the past 27 years, my mum has been by my side through thick and thin. She is my best friend, my inspiration and my rock.I live with my husband, but my pre-Covid-19 days were regularly filled with quality mother-daughter time. We would travel to work together, grab a bite to eat in between meetings, and every Tuesday night, we’d go ice skating together at Alexandra Palace, in north London, sharing a passion she passed down to me. But most importantly, my mum has accompanied me on my anxiety journey.For the past eight years, I’ve suffered with general anxiety disorder, which although controllable with certain techniques, has meant panic attacks, irrational fears and a lot of crying in my mum’s arms. But knowing that she has been present through my challenges and self-help discoveries has always filled me with calm.When lockdown started, my heart sank: I knew I wouldn’t be able to see her. Suddenly, instead of our uplifting face-to-face conversations, I found myself offloading my coronavirus anxiety, intense claustrophobia and sleep deprivation on to her via FaceTime.Last week, having significantly more time on my hands than usual, I decided to sort out my perfume cupboard, reordering my bottles into fragrance families – the florals I would one day wear to summer events, the aquatic beach scents I would sport on future holidays and, last, my everyday picks. I enjoyed spraying these and escaping lockdown life, if only for a few hours.Despite being a fragrance fanatic, I have not been spritzing my signature scents much during lockdown. Maybe because I’ve not felt myself lately or perhaps it’s just not felt appropriate to spray perfume each morning: it feels like the equivalent of wearing a full face of makeup to a sombre event.As I scanned the fragrances I once obsessed over, I felt empty and disoriented. Then, reaching for the back of the cupboard, I picked out a bottle I had never opened.It was my mother’s perfume, L’Occitane Néroli \u0026amp Orchidée Eau de Toilette, in its elegant bottle complete with a pink bow. I remembered she had picked it up for me and shamefully I had never used it.Sitting on the floor and spraying it on to my wrist, I immediately felt my mother’s presence. Memories came flooding back of baking cookies in the kitchen, walks in flower gardens and ice-skating together on a lake in Austria.It’s known that fragrance has a unique ability to uplift and encourage happiness as our brain associates certain smells with positive associations and emotions, but I was stunned to feel the warmth and comfort of my mum’s embrace after just one spritz.Since then, I have been wearing her fragrance every day, topping up every few hours and inhaling deeply. In lockdown, fragrance has become less of a luxury product and more of a therapeutic go-to that feeds my soul. It’s an invisible connection to her in a bottle.Not only has this new perfume routine worked for me, but it’s also put me in a more positive space to start and finish the day. Wearing my mother’s perfume has brought me closer to her than ever before and given me a glimpse of hope.

Some people thought I was singing, “On the dole, all day”’Before Harry’s Game aired over three nights, we went to a private press showing in London to around 100 people. At the end of the first hour-long episode, the house lights came up, the song played and nobody reacted. I thought, “That’s that.” After the second hour, there were less people talking over the music. The third episode was devastating. Both main characters died. Then the music came on. Not one person stood up, and the music just played out. That’s when we knew the song had touched a nerve.I didn’t think I had much of a voice. I would have loved to have been a rock’n’roller, but gradually I realised that I had a different timbre and an ethereal feel, which is very much part of the Clannad sound. Whenever people ask where that sound comes from I say, “Go to Donegal. You’ll feel the earthiness and the atmosphere.”The Irish Gaelic lyrics for Theme from Harry’s Game derived from a saying in a book of old Irish proverbs that our grandfather had given Ciarán: “Everything that is and will be, will cease to be. The moon and the stars, youth and beauty.” There’s no solution to war, just people killing each other. We were never a political band, but the sentiment that all things must pass inspired the lyrics.The chorus, “Fol lol the doh, fol the day, fol the doh fol the day,” comes from ancient Irish “mouth-music”. It was common in the reels and jigs world, but Ciarán thought it would be good to slow it down. Some people thought I was singing, “On the dole, all day.” Yorkshire TV sent over an engineer, Richard Dodd, who’d worked on 10cc’s I’m Not in Love and introduced us to the idea of layering the vocals. Ciarán and I sang looking right at each other. We could feel the emotion of the song. I think we used the second take, and layered it on top of that.There were only three TV channels back then, so we knew people would watch Harry’s Game. Noel Edmonds played the song on Radio 1 for the first time and then after the next song he said: “We’ve been inundated with people asking, ‘What was that?’” So he played it again. Bono said that when he first heard it in a car, he had to pull over. Then because of the Troubles it was taken off the radio for a day in case it was offensive, so we sent them the translation and they played it again.One day, we were in a Transit van in Germany the next we were being picked up in a limo to do Top of the Pops and taking pictures of ourselves jumping in and out. It was unreal for a small Irish folk band from Donegal. I was the first female Irish folk singer to break abroad. People started calling me the First Lady of Celtic Music, a title I’m really proud of."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88df48f4e521e3efff65a498a2721be006d8621/0_0_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53e92ede46d79d513c870e8fef4371f7","title":"coronavirus looking for good news run for heroes and an opera singing doctor","story":"Running fundraiser for NHS and frontline workers raises over £1m and the BBC announces a star-studded Big Night In The lockdown may be stretching the country’s patience to the limit, but it hasn’t deterred fundraisers trying to support the NHS and the workers on the frontline of the crisis.One running challenge has gone viral and has already raised £1m a BBC Big Night In will likely raise much more. A 5km running challenge has raised over £1m for NHS staff in just over two weeks after going viral on social media.The Run for Heroes campaign challenges people to use their permitted daily exercise to run 5km, donate £5 to help frontline NHS workers, and then tag five others to do the same.It has quickly spread on social media, with more than 200,000 runners taking part across 10 different countries.“Your love and support has raised money to go towards wellbeing packs, accommodation and travel for NHS workers and volunteers, provide longer-term mental health support for staff and families effected, and help patients leave hospital quickly and safely,” Run for Heroes said in a post announcing the £1m total.A number of high-profile celebrities have taken up the challenge, including singer Ellie Goulding, Olympic medal winner Mo Farah, footballer John Terry and DJ Chris Moyles.The campaign was launched by London-based documentary producer Olivia Strong, 27, on 28 March with the run.for.heroes Instagram page. She originally aimed to raise £5,000, but after reaching her target in just four days, she decided to extend the challenge.Matt Baker, Zoe Ball, Lenny Henry, Davina McCall and Paddy McGuinness have been confirmed as hosts of the BBC’s Big Night In, airing next week.The programme, a first-time collaboration between BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief, will celebrate the acts of kindness and the spirit of hope that have sustained the nation during the Covid-19 pandemic.Peter Kay, Catherine Tate and Gary Barlow will also be taking part from home, with further stars to be announced.Ball said: “We are always so blown away by folks’ generosity each year supporting Comic Relief and Children in Need and now, during these extraordinary times, more than ever people in our communities are in need of our love and support.”The show will air live on Thursday 23 April from 7pm, with music, comedy sketches and competitions, and any money raised will be matched pound for pound by the Treasury, as announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week.The money will be split equally between BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief to provide essential support to local charities, projects and programmes across the UK, to help people most in need of all ages and backgrounds.A doctor who has returned to the NHS to help treat Covid-19 patients has been entertaining his colleagues with his opera singing.Tenor Alex Aldren, or “Dr Opera”, has been serenading fellow medics by singing on the wards in his scrubs, even while wearing a face mask.A\u0026ampE nurse Mikaela posted a video of Aldren singing at Newham hospital in London, saying, “Music can heal the wounds which medicine cannot touch”, and adding that he was “an amazing opera singer”.Aldren trained in medicine but left the profession to become a tenor, and has recently returned to his old job, along with hundreds of others who recently left the NHS, to offer his skills in the fight against the pandemic.In another video posted on Twitter, emergency doctor Russell said, “He’s treating the team to some shows during quieter periods!

The House of Commons commission, the cross-party body in charge of Commons administration, is due to meet on Thursday to consider options, and it is expected that MPs will be asked to vote in favour of the new procedures when they return to Westminster next Tuesday.According to one MP familiar with the commission’s discussions, what is being proposed will amount to a hybrid parliament. He explained: “There will be some members in the chamber, and there will be some members who will be contributing digitally.”Throughout the recess, parliament’s digital services team has been putting in place technology that would allow this to work and now insiders are confident that question sessions in the Commons, such as PMQs, could involve many MPs participating by submitting questions electronically, using video conferencing technology.“We will have very, very slimmed-down proceedings – with just a skeleton group of ministers and MPs in the house,” said another commission source.Opposition parties are comfortable with these plans, although there is far less agreement about how the Commons can continue to debate and vote on legislation in an era of physical distancing. Commons debates normally involve speakers taking spontaneous interventions from MPs, which would be hard to facilitate via video conferencing, and MPs have always resisted attempts to get them to vote electronicall instead of in person in the ision lobbies.Before the Easter recess the parties agreed to limit the number of isions they called on legislation and Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, proposed getting MPs to vote in smaller groups, which would have meant a ision taking up to 40 minutes, not 15 minutes as now.But these are not seen as long-term solutions to the problems created by coronavirus. In a letter to the Speaker sent last week, Karen Bradley, the chair of the Commons procedure committee, said her committee did not view these plans to limit the number of isions as sustainable.She said: “Every colleague is entitled to express an opinion … in debate and in the lobbies. Members of the committee have expressed concerns that the time taken in isions under the social distancing procedures which you have announced will inhibit colleagues from testing the will of the house as they are entitled to do.”Bradley also said in her letter to Hoyle that, although some MPs agreed that they should be staying away from parliament to set an example, others thought that much of what happened in the chamber “cannot be replicated by virtual means” and that it was necessary for MPs to continue to visit their workplace “in the same way as other key workers”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/671abac647e875cf4c66f5d2dd91d77bdad442b7/381_86_2741_1645/master/2741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e455234be7cb86001a526d7454e4fcf","title":"raab sticks to the old non je ne regrette rien","story":"Though he couldn’t clear up confusion on the UK’s death figures, the foreign secretary is now almost managing a swaggerIt’s come to something when Dominic Raab is quite clearly the best person available for the job. With Boris Johnson likely to be out of action at Chequers for the coming weeks, Robert Jenrick getting stuck in transit between any of his three houses, Michael Gove being unable to explain why his daughter is a higher priority for a coronavirus test than a frontline NHS worker – has any situation ever been improved by Mikey not staying at home? – and Priti Patel being Priti Patel, there are few obvious alternatives to Raab to front up the daily Downing Street press conference.Which isn’t to say that Dom is by any means an ideal choice. Practice hasn’t made perfect, but it has made him a bit less rubbish. He’ll never be totally relaxed – his missing-person habit is hard to break – but he is a lot less sweaty and nervy than he was last week when he was visibly struggling. There’s almost a swagger. Albeit one that barely disguises his low threshold for boredom. Because Dom is not dim – well, not compared with many of his colleagues – and the tedium of having nothing new to say has already got to him. He can’t even bring himself to go through the charade of appearing interested. The briefing is just a half-hour ordeal to be endured.Stifling a yawn, the foreign secretary began by thanking NHS staff. Not just for saving Boris, but for all their efforts elsewhere. My guess is that most NHS workers were either too busy or too knackered to have paid much attention. If the government is sincere in its newfound gratitude for a health service that it has been happy to underfund and understaff for the past 10 years, it is going to have to be prepared to alienate its traditional low-tax Tory voters. Not to mention the Brexiters who want many of the immigrants who work in the NHS to sod off.Raab then moved on the daily figures. The death rate was down a bit, but then it always is at weekends, as for some reason the person whose job it is to do the counting doesn’t work on Sundays. He was more indirectly straightforward – Dom can’t do anything without having first out-thought himself – on why deaths in care homes weren’t being included in the daily stats. Because if they were, then everyone would see that many more people were dying than he was prepared to admit.Visibly losing the will to live, Dom also failed to adequately explain why, halfway into the government’s target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, we were still only managing about 18,000. It was like this: the coronavirus was a tricky bugger that spread exponentially. So the only way to combat it was to be even more cunning. Start by doing almost no tests and then take it by surprise by testing exponentially. The reason we were apparently so far behind was to lull the coronavirus into a false sense of security.“This is a national test,” Raab concluded. Really? The whole thing is just an Ant Middleton SAS: Who Dares Wins TV show, where the first country to break the lockdown gets thrown off the course. Silly, silly me. There was I imagining that what we were really dealing with was a global pandemic that required proper scientific evidence, when reality it was a psycho standoff between us and the virus to see who gives way first.Nor did the questions from the media produce much in the way of straight answers. The government doesn’t yet seem to have even reached a point where there is a plan of what criteria might need to be met to end the lockdown or which groups might be allowed out first. Presumably Raab is still banking on using his black-belt martial arts skills to defeat the coronavirus with a straight ippon. “I’m sorry, I can’t really hear you,” was as far as he got in offering an apology for Priti Patel’s suggestion that most NHS staff were wasting PPE protection at fancy dress parties. So no. He wasn’t sorry at all. Besides, no one was going to be seeing Patel again in the foreseeable futureInevitably – because these briefings always do – the questions turned to why, even without the care home and death-in-the-community figures, the UK was heading for the worst mortality rate in Europe. Was this part of the plan? Raab’s face momentarily turned to panic. No one had ever called what the government had done up till now a plan. More like a “take it a day at a time and hope something turns up” approach.Did the government regret not acting a bit quicker? A month ago, it was advising 250,000 people to get stuck in together at the Cheltenham festival when other countries were in lockdown. Dom was firmly of the “Je ne regrette rien” école. Never explain, never apologise. So what if the death toll was now over 11,000 and rising by hundreds per day?We shouldn’t read anything into South Korea’s low mortality rates, he said, because they weren’t comparing like with like. We were excluding many more Covid-19 deaths than them. We were just doing them a favour to make them look good. But you could be damned sure if it was the UK that was at the bottom of the death charts, the government would be shouting about it from the rooftops. And I, for one one, would be applauding them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2b3a4c25ba5cef36fe8661c8545d895cdb30f3/0_74_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6aa4c25440a0121c23857ece149673f","title":"interstellar object oumuamua believed to be active asteroid","story":"Scientists believe cigar-shaped visitor to our solar system is fragment of a larger body The cigar-shaped interstellar visitor to our solar system known as ‘Oumuamua could be the remnants of a larger body that was torn apart by its host star, according to researchers.The dark, reddish object that hurtled into our solar system in 2017 and was named after the Hawaiian word for messenger or scout has long puzzled scientists.Among its peculiarities is the lack of an envelope of gas and dust that comets typically give off as they heat up. Further work by experts suggested the body was accelerated by the loss of water vapour and other gases – as seen with comets but not asteroids. The upshot was that ‘Oumuamua was labelled a “comet in disguise”.Now scientists say they have shed light on the mystery and addressed the myriad pieces of the ‘Oumuamua puzzle.They say ‘Oumuamua is an “active asteroid” formed from a body that was torn apart by its parent star and then ejected into interstellar space.“Most planetary bodies … consist of numerous pieces of rock that have coalesced under the influence of gravity. You could imagine them as sandcastles floating in space,” said Dr Yun Zhang, a co-author of the new study from the Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur in France.These bodies experience a number of forces as they pass their star.“A tidal encounter between a planet or small body and a star is a tug-of-war game between the gravitational pull of the star and the self-gravity of the flyby body,” said Zhang, noting that when the body passes too close to the star and enters the tidal disruption region, it can stretch and be torn apart giving rise to fragments.Writing in the journal Nature Astronomy, Zhang and Prof Doug Lin of the University of California’s Lick Observatory, report how they used computer models to reveal that such a process could have produced ‘Oumuamua and explain features including its tumbling motion, colour and unusual shape.Zhang said near and far parts of ‘Oumuamua’s parent body would have been pulled apart from each other in the tidal disruption region, resulting in the formation of elongated fragments, such as ‘Oumuamua, which would be glued together by surface material that melted near the star and froze as it flew on.Zhang said most of the volatile substances on ‘Oumuamua’s surface would have been lost from heating by the star around which it formed, but some residual water ice could have been preserved below its surface and subsequently heated by our, hotter, sun – explaining its unusual acceleration. “We may call ‘Oumuamua an active asteroid,” said Zhang.The team say ‘Oumuamua could have formed from either a comet or a planet several times the size of Earth, but the former better explains ‘Oumuamua’s apparent subsurface water ice. The star around which ‘Oumuamua formed, they add, would probably have been similar to our sun but smaller and denser – or possibly a white dwarf.Zhang says the findings not only scotch again the much-publicised notion that ‘Oumuamua is an alien spacecraft, but offer an efficient way in which asteroidal interstellar objects, previously thought to be rare, can be formed.What’s more, she says, with objects such as ‘Oumuamua passing through “habitable zones”, such as our own solar system, they may even carry seeds of life.Dr Alan Jackson, of Arizona State University, who was not involved in the study but has previously carried out research into ‘Oumuamua, welcomed the work.“The idea of ‘Oumuamua being a fragment of a larger body that was tidally disrupted by passing close to its parent star was suggested by Matija Ćuk in 2018,” he said. “But this is the first work that I have seen that really explores that idea in detail and shows that it might explain how ‘Oumuamua was produced and a lot of its unusual features.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d35dd6aced5bb8c6854f563c192322dd9195b89f/0_297_6267_3760/master/6267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b0839655cc56b6cfba8434f516aa23d","title":"my working week mother arrives refuge covid 19 symptoms","story":"We are getting full very quickly but it’s important that women who have survived domestic abuse know we can support themMy first task is to review staffing levels and check in with everyone across the different refuges. Some staff are now working remotely or self-isolating but so far, so good. Those of us travelling into the offices are worried. No one wants to take this virus home to families, and whatever precautions we put in place there is still that thought in the back of our minds.I check the post and see something that looks like a National Insurance number for a resident. She has been waiting several weeks and without it her first benefit payment won’t be released. I let the woman know – she is relieved.I sign a food bank voucher for a family who arrived a week ago (thankfully they are still operating). Then we have our daily virtual check-in as a team. We talk about how difficult everyone is finding social distancing, especially with the toddlers who just want to run up and hug you.It’s exhausting work at the best of times, but now even more so for those people who are physically in the refuge. Those off site feel guilty about not being there they see how hard it is and really want to help, but their health has to come first. We talk through these feelings at our virtual staff meetings.A colleague from a nearby refuge belonging to the charity I work for tells me a family has arrived with symptoms of coronavirus. The mother didn’t know if they would be accepted, but she was so pleased to be offered a self-contained unit for herself and her children to recover in away from other families. A resident’s mental health has declined significantly since the lockdown. Without college, volunteering and face-to-face counselling, she is struggling. We are concerned she is getting caught up in the past and the emotions that go with the abuse she survived. I get in touch with our local housing team to find out what their plans are. They confirm they are operating remotely using telephone interviews, and that viewings and temporary accommodation allocations will go ahead with appropriate precautions. I dial into a meeting hosted by the local authority. Everyone is relieved to hear that refuges are still running, taking referrals and bringing in families in need.A resident asks about an email she has received from her solicitor she has been granted her leave to remain, but she can’t pick up her new biometric card until the solicitor’s office is open again.A five-year-old comes into the office to make a call to a staff member who is shielding. I hear him say “I miss you so much, have you gone forever?”. We get a big delivery of craft resources to share between all the families in the service. The children and family worker was going to come in to sort them out but she has developed a cough so needs to self-isolate. The children are getting increasingly restless so I start iding out resources into bags while taking other calls.In the staff catch-up we talk about referrals and how many more women we are seeing. We all think this will increase in the weeks to come. As not all move-on options are available for women, we are getting full quickly.I install a wifi booster. The teenager downstairs is very relieved she has been struggling to upload her homework and as she is self-isolating she can’t use the desk in the main lounge anymore. I talk one mum through how to use the food voucher she has just received as part of the free school meals. English is not her first language and I have to stay a safe distance but we get there in the end.My colleague tells me the family with coronavirus are starting to recover. It’s heartening to hear how all of the other women came together to make the family meals and left them at their door. The department for work and pensions calls to update me on how they are changing their processes to deal with the 1m extra claims, and what the escalation process will be for agencies working with vulnerable people, including domestic violence survivors, to ensure they can access their benefits.I’m emotionally drained but feel really proud of my staff and the residents. My final job before I head home is to check all the families have enough cleaning supplies for the weekend.The author of this piece is a domestic abuse service manager for Hestia, a charity supporting adults and children in crisis.

Cavendish hoped to compete in the Madison in Japan and win the Olympic gold medal that has eluded him but he was not selected by British Cycling.In a report by cyclingnews, Cavendish was quoted as saying: “It’s hard for me to go. British Cycling have been … they realised now they don’t want to be in the position where they have to not take me. They said to me: ‘You haven’t done any World Cups.’ When have I had to do World Cups?”Wiggins replied: “That’s the thing that’s lacking now in British Cycling: someone who actually knows what they’re talking about. It’s all about box-ticking. With you it was just a case of opening a few doors so you could get qualified, knowing you would deliver on the day, which you do and always did – three world titles, Olympic medal and all that.“That’s sort of been taken away now. They’d rather someone qualified for all the World Cups, then finished 10th in the Olympics. I think it’s shit, to be honest, but hey, cycling has changed so much.” The pair went on to discuss how British Cycling had asked for the return of equipment – bikes and skinsuits – with which they competed at previous Olympics. Wiggins said of his bike from the 2012 time trial: “They didn’t have a choice with me. I’m fucking taking it, it’s mine, I fucking did it, I’m having it.”Cavendish said: “I’ve still got a skinsuit but they took the skinsuits back. What are we going to do?

It’s a haunting sound and it’s almost as if you’re in a war,” Ian McKinley says as he begins to explain the impact of the lockdown in Italy which began on 9 March and will now continue for at least another three weeks. McKinley, the Irish rugby player who lost the sight in his left eye when he was raked at the bottom of a ruck in Dublin in 2010, understands adversity.The 30-year-old also understands better than most how you come back from uncertain times. Having been forced into retirement he took a chance in 2012 and accepted an offer to do some informal coaching in a small Italian city, Udine, near the Slovenian border. Neither he nor his girlfriend, Cordelia, who is now his wife, could speak any Italian but they adapted. Then, with the help of his brother, McKinley decided to try to play rugby again while wearing specially designed goggles which could protect his eyes. Slowly, but with inspirational determination, McKinley came back to professional rugby – with such impact that he has played nine Tests for Italy at fly-half.McKinley and his wife now live in Treviso, in northern Italy, close to the area that has been hit so severely by Covid-19. He is engaging and intelligent – and also a compelling witness to the Italian lockdown. Britain and Ireland are weeks behind Italy, both in terms of facing the worst of the pandemic, and also in coping with such stringent self‑isolation. Hearing his calm voice from Treviso, and seeing his wry and wistful expressions on my laptop screen, McKinley is like a guide from the future. Amid the ghostly life he has lived the past six weeks, and the continuing worry, he has found hope and light.“We’ve been in a lockdown for over a month now and thankfully the silence and the sirens have subsided somewhat. It’s become a bit better the past few days. The numbers are going down a little. But it still feels very surreal to have gone from living your life to the fullest, being involved with lots of things, to basically zero. You can only walk around if you have a pet to exercise and so we’re lucky we have a little dog. We’re allowed out once a day to walk the dog and there’s no one around. This little city I live in is not like Dublin or London – but 70,000 people still live here. And it’s completely dead.The curbing of freedom is working, slowly, even if the death rate is still distressing. “It’s well over 19,000 now,” McKinley says, “but the rate of deaths per day is going down. The rate of infection is going down. That’s all you can do – try and find something positive in this mad pandemic. Time will tell which measures have been most effective. It seems as if the UK started out doing things differently and now the lockdown is maybe not being followed as closely as in Italy.”Britain has now passed the highest daily death rate suffered in both Italy and Spain. “The measures that have been taken by the Italian government have been heavily criticised by a lot of people,” McKinley says, “but they’ve worked pretty well. I think they’ve acted in the best way they could have.”It’s also helped that, from the outset, virtually all Italians have adhered to the rigorous lockdown while avoiding the kind of panic buying that accompanied the UK’s initial response. “A huge amount of credit has to go to the Italian people because there’s been no panic buying. We’ve not had any toilet paper wars here. Certain things like flour and eggs are a bit lower than normal. But it’s never got to a stage where people are fighting over things. When people are backed into a corner, and there’s a lot of adversity, you definitely get a sense of community spirit in Italy, of making sure that each person is OK. People are pulling together and wanting to keep each other strong to try and get through this.”His own situation feels more precarious because, as McKinley admits, “I haven’t played many games this year. The difference with Italian clubs in relation to British and Irish rugby is that there are no second teams. We’re a squad of 52 and only 23 people go out on to a rugby field to play. It’s been a bit up and down for me this year.“So, yeah, this virus has thrown a ner in the works. I have a contract this year with Benetton – but we can’t say what will happen next season because people can’t commit to anything. When you’re cooped up in a house for months you can definitely think of the worst-case scenario. Or you can look at it as a good break for your body and time to reflect on what’s really important. In terms of pay cuts I’m sure players will not begrudge that because this is just such a huge issue.”McKinley has obviously come through testing times before. “My life was turned upside down in 2010 with the eye injury. And then, ultimately, when I made the decision in 2011 to retire. I moved to Udine when I was 22 and not knowing the language is tricky. You certainly learn a lot about yourself. You basically sink or swim in those situations. I adapted so I’m forever grateful I made the decision to come over. I’ve made friends for life. Thankfully from the work side of things it’s worked out really well. I’m also very fortunate to have two homes because my family are back in Ireland. But my wife and I have created a home in Italy.”He laughs when saying that he often dreams in Italian now. But McKinley pauses when I ask if Italy has changed him as a person. “That’s a very good question. I think it has. Absolutely. People have said to me: ‘You were on course for this great career in Ireland,’ and I was dealt that hand. Other people are dealt their hand and they have to get through whatever problems they’ve faced. For me, it’s opened up the world. So for example, working with the Laureus organisation in so many different areas of Italy has made me see how they use sport against violence, discrimination and disadvantage around the world. Now we’re at a standstill Laureus is working closely with 200 sports and their development programmes globally to ensure they get support during the pandemic.“So, going back to your question about change through adversity, I would not be speaking Italian if I was still living in Ireland. I would not have been exposed to everything that has been so positive for me in Italy. I certainly appreciate things a lot more. I want to win rugby games and trophies, of course, but when you step back and think about what’s important in life, you get a real perspective. I still want to perform at the highest level but so much else matters more.”Thousands of young rugby players around the world wear the goggles that McKinley helped pioneer – and he is contacted regularly by partially sighted people who still want to succeed in sport. “I get messages weekly from people who have had similar injuries or problems to mine. That’s incredible. And knowing that 2,000 people around the world are using rugby goggles is wonderful. The idea of the goggles were in the pipeline but my brother Phillip put me in touch with Johnny Merrigan, an Irish design student, who is a very important part of this story. Myself, Phillip and Johnny got together and basically pushed the product over the line. The manufacturing company obviously take the plaudits because they’ve produced the goggles.”McKinley would like to move into coaching once his playing career ends. “Even when I stopped playing the first time I wanted to become a coach. I still have that passion. I really enjoy seeing players grow and develop because rugby is a wonderful sport for inclusion. I’ve had two years of coaching experience, from when I first came to Italy, and I loved it.”In the meantime, like the rest of us, McKinley has to wait and hope that he and his family and all those he cares about survive the coronavirus crisis. “It’s difficult,” he agrees. “You go through good days and bad days. For us, it’s a very small sacrifice to sit in our nice apartments, with modern technology, and wait it out. There are people out there on the front line, fighting it every day. So we just need to stay home and follow the guidelines.”When I suggest that even the first time he gets tackled hard on the training field will feel good, McKinley grins. “Depends who it’s from. But the little things in life that you take for granted are going to seem sweet. To walk down to a coffee shop, and just talk to the people you know, your friends and rugby mates, will feel very special. But everybody is in the same boat. It helps to know that the vast majority of the human population is in this together.”Ian McKinley and Laureus encourage everyone to stay home, stay safe and stay healthy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e57e17a4bf87bd35f97ac1da7010793438f083/0_270_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=189de1733f927fae81544c1c01fb1f7b","title":"unease resounds across cricket without the comforting hum of county game","story":"County cricket’s defiantly low-key nature has brought joy to millions but may not save it in a looming era of belt-tighteningThe ice cream stand at Worcester. The grass bank at Canterbury. The tree-lined riverside approach to Sophia Gardens in Cardiff, one of those grounds that always seems to be wet, even when it’s dry. The way the sunlight dapples off the new pavilion at Headingley as Steve Patterson lopes in for his eighth over. The second-hand bookshop at Derby where you could spend an entire afternoon browsing the modest selection of tea-stained hardbacks with alluring titles such as An Illustrated History of Ilkeston CC 1910-1985 and Keeper’s End! Horace Baggs: A Life In Cricket.It’s funny what you miss when you’re indoors. Of all the privations we are enduring as a people, the loss of county cricket should probably sit some way down the list. But there were times during the listless, gloriously sunny weekend when it was perhaps only natural to wonder, idly and hypothetically, how the opening day of the 2020 County Championship season was going.Sunday it was, or at least should have been. Sibley v Philander at Taunton. Pujara v Maharaj at Headingley. Some 20-year-old seamer you’d never heard of taking six for spit. England’s top-order batting candidates falling over each other in a deluge of single-figure scores. Bumper bank holiday crowds. But perhaps what we missed above all was the promise and the hope, the sense of renewal and rebirth, the first chilly pint of the summer, the conviction that finally, this would be the year you made it to Wantage Road.Instead: nothing. A whispering void. The first seven rounds of the championship have already been called off. It’s probably safe to say they won’t be rescheduled. The talk is that with the shutdown poised to endure well into the summer, this year’s competition will be scrapped entirely in order to ensure the “most financially important forms of the game” – essentially, England and the Twenty20 Blast – can be prioritised.At which point: what? The simplest answer is that, like most of the other events that have fallen to Covid‑19, you simply skip a year and start afresh in 2021. But this would be to overlook the many aspects in which the championship is not like other events.In a way, it’s unique. It’s a competition that does not generate significant revenue, indeed it haemorrhages it in vast sums to the point where there are a number of counties who are quietly relieved not to be playing it. Unless you’re watching extremely closely, it creates neither buzz nor water-cooler moments. It does not fill acres of broadcasting time. Sky are not banging down the doors of the ECB demanding it be played at all costs. It is not part of the national conversation and will not be part of our collective healing process.The entire point of the County Championship, insofar as there is one, is to exist. It provides an ambient background hum to a busy season, quietly develops the next generation of international players, offers immeasurable comfort to the millions who will never set foot inside a ground and the thousands who do. In other words, it serves no wider purpose than simply to happen. And so when it doesn’t happen, the effect is more seismic and disturbing than simply scratching off one Boat Race, one Wimbledon, one Tour de France. The temptation, rather, is to wonder whether it will ever recover.This is after all a competition that has been tinkered to death – formats adulterated, schedules scrambled, rules tweaked, teams assembled and dissolved mid-season, whether through international availability or white‑ball blocks – only for that death to never materialise. This has generated an impression of timelessness and permanence, of an institution that can withstand pretty much anything you throw at it.But pandemic and penury have served up a starker, harsher reality. The talk coming from Lord’s now is of “keeping the lights on”, of redoubled priorities and focusing on what really matters. Where does a competition that stretches from April to September, takes up 14 weeks in the calendar, attracts tiny crowds and no broadcast income, fit into this new landscape? For decades the sport’s administrators have treated four-day cricket like the unloved jar of piccalilli in the back of the fridge: ignored, untended, shoved to the forgotten peripheries. Now catastrophe may just embolden them to finish what they started.And really, this is about far more than one competition, one format, even one sport. It’s about what happens when the doors are finally flung open and society clanks back into gear. What we choose to value. What it feels acceptable to fight for. Is it possible to aspire to more than simply keeping the lights on? Is it horrendously privileged to lionise the 18-county system and a proper first-class competition and sunny afternoons at Bristol and Hove when an entire sport is in crisis? Or are we doomed to a grim fight for survival, public bodies desperately trying to claw back lost income in increasingly undignified ways?“We must face the fact,” said the secretary of Warwickshire at their annual end-of-season dinner, “that we are providing a spectacle the public does not want.” That was in 1967. Then as now the championship offered the best, richest, most varied domestic red-ball cricket available anywhere on Earth. And yet decline – or at least the sensation of it – had long since taken root. Perhaps, in hindsight, the reckoning was coming all along. Perhaps one man’s moment of chaos is another man’s moment of clarity. Perhaps I should really have got to Wantage Road while I still had the chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf30cdbfdf0a7ef2e6c911b62dbe8012e405dca9/0_1307_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188bd6811f03cbd05cd7d4909559a119","title":"sir stirling moss motor racing legends life in pictures","story":"Stirling Moss, arguably the greatest driver never to have won the F1 drivers’ championship, has died.

Masterminded by New Movement Collective, a group of superlative contemporary dancers who come together to make ambitious happenings, we’ll have to bookmark that one for the future. But in the meantime, the company has made full-length films of its previous works available for free online.It’s an interesting proposition since the majority of NMC’s work is immersive performance, the very opposite of watching a static screen. Even in well-shot pieces such as these, there’s a question about whether the film stands alone as a piece of art, or merely a record of what took place. The live-ness of the experience is flattened, and rather than experiencing the serendipities of an improvised journey, the camera decides your view.Yet, as anyone who’s wandered confused around an immersive show will know, enforced focus can be a good thing. In Collapse (2016), one of the simplest scenes is made the strongest by the camera’s framing. Four dancers run on the spot, side by side, with detached determination, variously overtaking and dropping back in an interminable race with each other that has no destination. A perfect physical metaphor for modern life.One signature of the company is closely handled duets, often stripped of traditional gender roles. Another is their appetite for collaboration with technology, design and architecture. Casting Traces (2012) involved navigating a paper maze designed by architect Elin Eyborg. Inspired by Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy, it’s a piece full of mysterious strangers and doppelgangers, silhouettes and clever shadow play, and also a sense of cautious weariness that permeates a lot of NMC’s work.Nest (2013), took over the former Welsh Chapel (and ex-Limelight nightclub) in the West End of London to create a journey based loosely on Homer’s Odyssey. Architects Studio Weave designed huge, grid-like steel frames for the dancers to move in and around (at one point a boat cleverly appears inside them), and stunning lighting projections from Marshmallow Laser Feast make it look as if the floor is buckling in waves under the dancers’ feet. The flashing lights in the darkness, the clubby music mixed with Monteverdi – it was all pulse-raising when seen live and it’s still impressive on screen.But NMC’s architectural attention to space loses potency when you’re not experiencing it in three dimensions. And the things that make for curious surprise when you’re exploring an atmospheric building – discovering someone wedged up into the ceiling or two dancers wearing pig masks – just feel random on film. Yet there are also small moments, easily missed, that shine through, such as a snippet of a duet from Jonathan Goddard and Gemma Nixon, two dancers with rare affinity, moving with absolute seamlessness (the bit where Goddard rubs his temple along Nixon’s calf I rewound to savour again).On film, there’s no doubt that narrative is an easier sell than thematic or abstract dance, which demands a commitment from the viewer that we’re not in the habit of giving to the small screen. Without the excitement of being at a live event, weaknesses of choreography or concept are more exposed – you can sometimes feel the lack of a single, driving vision in the collective nature of NMC’s work. But whether it’s a document or a standalone work (jury’s out), there are still rewards to be found by delving into the archive. At least until the chance to be choreographed by robots comes around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c69d3e3258d8560ebc368ccdc8841853646260/2726_352_2359_1416/master/2359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a013cc3d94248e6a915f063e72fd89e2","title":"eamonn holmes says 5g coronavirus claims may not be false","story":"ITV host said ‘it’s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative’The This Morning co-host Eamonn Holmes has suggested that it may “suit the state narrative” to dismiss false claims linking 5G technology and coronavirus.He spoke out on the ITV show after the presenter Alice Beer described the conspiracy theories as “ridiculous” and “incredibly stupid”.Holmes, who was co-presenting with his wife, Ruth Langsford, responded that “it’s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative”.He told Beer: “I totally agree with everything you are saying but what I don’t accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don’t know it’s not true. No one should attack or damage or do anything like that but it’s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative.”He added: “That’s all I would say, as someone with an inquiring mind.”Holmes made the remarks after scientists dismissed any link between 5G and coronavirus, with the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, previously calling a conspiracy theory, spread via YouTube, that linked the two “dangerous nonsense”.Viewers criticised the presenter’s comments on social media and accused him of legitimising baseless theories. One, vickster51, wrote: “So I’ve just heard This Morning presenter Eamonn Holmes legitimise the stories linking the coronavirus lockdown to 5G. On national television. Wow. How irresponsible can you get. Switching off. Hope Holly and Phil are back soon.”Andy Green said: “Well done Eamonn. You just added more fuel to this 5G conspiracy theory by legitimising what is utter nonsense. You need to research properly before pronouncing.”MPs have called for social media companies to be held to account following reports of phone masts being attacked after the claim spread online.At least 20 phone masts across the UK are believed to have been set alight or vandalised since the start of the pandemic in connection to false 5G claims, according to government and industry sources, who said this month they were increasingly concerned about the impact of the baseless theories.Facebook has since stepped up efforts to stop far-right groups from promoting conspiracy theories linking coronavirus to 5G.Ofcom is assessing comments made by the conspiracist David Icke during an interview broadcast by the local television station London Live, in which he suggested that the coronavirus pandemic was part of a plot by governments to destroy the economy and conduct mass surveillance.The media watchdog previously ruled that a local radio station had breached its rules after one of its guests suggested the Covid-19 outbreak was caused by the rollout of 5G mobile technology.A government spokesman said: “We are aware of a number of attacks on phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online. Those responsible for these criminal acts will face the full force of the law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de23c9d8151bd8d9c5493d9d92d5cc7f1ccefcc7/0_8_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5fb0187ebb1880a9d6989a8d14f229a","title":"the early days of home computing in pictures","story":"“There were no design conventions for the earliest home computers, no rules for how they’d look,” says Alex Wiltshire, author of Home Computers, a new book that explores the rapidly changing face of the household machine between its birth in the 1970s and the 1990s.

Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

After another brutal, gale-pummelled winter, the little island is waking up. The machair, the great grass carpet that covers almost everything, has cowslips, primroses and wild hyacinths pushing up at the spring sun. But I can’t go. Caledonian MacBrayne won’t let outsiders on the ferry. My friend, self-isolating in her family’s croft, suggests a Facebook site that has video of an afternoon at a favourite beach: “Lie in your garden, close your eyes, listen to the sea and pretend.”As you approach it, the island hardly seems to be there at all. “The land beneath the waves” is just one of the old names for Tiree, a 10-mile scrap of dune, rock and grass to the west of Mull on the far edge of the Inner Hebrides. It does seem not much more than a wisp, a dream of an island, a piece of flotsam in the vastness of the Atlantic. There is nothing west of it until Newfoundland, 2,000 miles away. But when the ferry shoulders alongside Gott Bay pier, the place is real enough, though constructed mainly of fly-away things – fine sand, grass, wildflowers. Its most solid features are the sheep and the 600-odd hardy, friendly souls who live there, and the wind.I’ve been visiting all my life. All our childhood holidays were spent there, except for one disastrous caravanning trip round mid-Wales. Before the first world war, my grandmother, whose aunt lived there, played on the beaches and in the same rockpools where my children do. Maybe one day I’ll help my grandchildren make sand volcanoes, dig for cockles and start out on the surf at Balevuilin Bay. My children have got the bug – ask them where, anywhere in the world, they’d like to go for summer holidays and their answer is guaranteed.What is it to us, and the other people who love the place, visitors and islanders? Tiree is not like anywhere else, not even any other Hebridean island: that’s clear enough. In June it has more sun than almost anywhere in the UK, for a start. It is an escape, of course, a sanctuary place where a life expands, where your eyes rediscover the long distance, your nose the smells of a simpler world: salt-flavoured rain, warm clover, kelp drying on the beach, sun on a tarred roof, fresh mackerel frying in a buttered pan. We are city people pretending to be Highland crofters: your holiday is just a reality TV show, a friend laughed at us. Yes, not unfair: that’s how lucky we are.For all my life, Tiree has been most important when I haven’t been there. Working, worrying, in exhaustion or despair, it’s the place I go to in my mind for ease and peace, with the backstop of knowing that if things get tough, I can just get to Oban and jump on the ferry. Now, for the first time ever, I can’t. An Tirisdeach, the island’s fortnightly news-sheet arrives through my city letterbox with news that the Baptist chapel at Baugh has become an isolation ward – should need arise – and a charming editorial that begs Tiree’s friends and visitors to stay away. We mustn’t even go to help with the lambing. The editor promises the island will welcome us back, when the right time comes.• Alex Renton’s latest book is Stiff Upper Lip: Secrets, Crimes and the Schooling of a Ruling Class"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d10547066982f09d2cdc0f3ecde1565c23821c1/0_101_3832_2300/master/3832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=929ea80f0b058cf4adb3f6d3f0b5bc37","title":"lonely planet closes its melbourne and london offices where now for travel","story":"As the travel publisher closes its Melbourne and London offices, a guidebook writer asks what’s next for an industry in crisis Covid-19 has changed everything. In particular, it has changed everything about travel. As a Lonely Planet writer you learn fast that change is the only constant on the road. Still, no one was expecting the changes announced last week: that Lonely Planet is to close its Melbourne production facility and London offices “almost entirely”, as well as its magazine and Trade and Reference ision. The famous guidebooks will continue to be published through the company’s Dublin and Tennessee offices, but they will also face some job cuts.Certainly, the closure of Lonely Planet’s original headquarters in Melbourne is the end of an era. It was in Melbourne that co-founders Tony and Maureen Wheeler set up shop in 1973 after finishing their epic overland journey from London across Asia to Australia. They published an account of the journey in Across Asia on the Cheap, a stapled together volume featuring hand-drawn maps and the nowfamous logo, designed by Tony. It sold 1,500 copies. Encouraged by its success, the Wheelers followed with guides to Nepal, Africa, New Zealand and New Guinea.In 1977’s Africa on the Cheap, readers were advised to enjoy the “Bonadir weavers and old mosques” of Mogadishu, while a guide to the Middle East offered advice on hitch-hiking to Baghdad from Syria. But, it was the success of the 1981 India guide that put Lonely Planet in the backpacks of many young traveller hungry for foreign experiences.“I remain proud of what Lonely Planet achieved,” says Tony Wheeler. “I’m always delighted when people say, ‘I wouldn’t have gone there if LP hadn’t have given me a push, showed me the way.’”Ryan Ver Berkmoes, the veteran writer, one-time Lonely Plant publisher and author of 130 guidebooks, describes the company under Tony and Maureen, as “the friend you wanted next to you at the bar in the country you’d just landed in. Full of smart, savvy advice so you could start having a great trip. It was a rollicking and amazing place where you made friends worldwide.”I signed up in 1999 to research Ethiopia and – as with millions of other travellers – subsequent Lonely Planet trips provided foundational life experiences. I healed a broken heart researching the desert landscapes of Namibia. Years in Italy taught me to appreciate life’s simple pleasures. When my mother died, my grieving father joined me in Sicily. A working-class man who never travelled for pleasure, he was consoled by the cavalcade of treasures we saw. Last week, a friend phoned from Benghazi, Libya, to enquire about my health and safety – a poignant irony given that he now lives in a city run by militias.While part of the company’s mission was undoubtedly to introduce readers to offbeat or struggling nations, Ver Berkmoes emphasises the role Lonely Planet played in popularising travel in people’s lives. “It wasn’t just places like Libya, Burma (Myanmar) or Timor-Leste, there were few mainstream, widely available guidebooks for much of the planet” he explains. “Lonely Planet helped take the foreign out of foreign travel.”The company has also been a technology pioneer. There was a Lonely Planet blog in 1994, five years before the word “blog” was coined. A website followed, along with CitySync guidebooks on PalmPilots. Most innovative of all was the online traveller’s forum, Thorn Tree, launched in 1996. According to Jane Rawson, one of its first moderators: “A tiny web team was set up and told to figure out what the internet was and whether it was useful to travellers.” In 2016, Lonely Planet’s online community topped 10 million. Social media, it turns out, was kind of a big thing.In many ways, the company’s fortunes mirror the evolution of mass tourism. In 1973, the year Lonely Planet was founded, the US budget airline Southwest turned its first profit and showed the reliability of low-cost air travel. Since then, tourism has increased as travel has become more accessible. In 2017, the UN World Tourism Organization estimated that the world might see 1.8 billion travellers by 2030. That was before Covid-19. Now, even Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou of easyJet, the second largest budget airline in Europe, thinks his company will feel like a startup again once national lockdowns are lifted.Asked where travel will go now, Tony Wheeler says: “I don’t think the current crisis is going to end the role of the traditional guidebook – whether it’s in print or digital. I’ve already got the new LP guidebooks for travels I had intended to make later this year.”Ver Berkmoes also believes guidebooks will endure: “Once we start travelling again … so many old faces and brands will be gone. People will need that friend next to them in the bar with loads of smart advice.”He should know, as during his time at Lonely Planet he weathered two catastrophes that ravaged the travel industry – the 911 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, which devastated large parts of Asia. “The 911 attacks had a profound effect on the company. People stopped travelling and bookshops returned all their guidebooks,” says Ver Berkmoes. “The company lost dozens of talented people. It was wrenching for everyone. But travel did come back and so did Lonely Planet.”In contrast, the tsunami galvanised the company to help in a huge humanitarian effort. The Wheeler’s donated relief funds and significant resources were deployed to assist where possible. “We had people on the ground in all the most affected areas and we scouted for projects that would make a difference,” says Ver Berkmoes. “There was a comprehensive part of the website that answered practical questions such as: how can I help? where should I travel? how do I get home?”They are the same questions that many people are asking now, which is why the company’s commitment to its guidebooks is reassuring. If the future of travel looks more like the past – fewer trips with logistical challenges that are more carefully considered given new risks and uncertainty – then trustworthy travel information will be of great value. As I write, there are Lonely Planet writers emerging from lockdown in Beijing. They have a view of the road ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a545959b8260300f7c4311f182a0f3045f7b60/395_126_1893_1138/master/1893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=909a476a37dec04f95d79a4f2bbed125","title":"tiger king netflix special recap joe exotic","story":"A 40-minute special dropped by Netflix on Sunday checks in with some of the tangential players of the runaway hit, with only minor revelationsCalling all you cool cats and kittens – Tiger King is back. Well, kind of. After the outlandish series took the world of memes and quarantine streaming by storm since its premiere in March, Netflix dropped a previously unplanned addendum on Sunday. The Tiger King and I, a special of short, softball interviews hosted by the comedian Joel McHale from his house in Los Angeles, featured interviews with eight people adjacent to Joe Exotic: Erik Cowie, Jeff and Lauren Lowe, John Reinke, Kelci “Saff” Saffery, Joshua Dial, John Finlay and Rick Kirkham.McHale, a breezy interviewer in AirPods, mostly avoided the show’s more controversial topics if you’re looking for further investigation into Joe’s crimes, the death of Carole Baskin’s ex-husband or the mistreatment of big cats in the US, this is not the place. But if 40 minutes of popcorn-style interviews (how many leather jackets does Jeff Lowe own? How are Finlay’s new teeth?) then Netflix has you covered. The Tiger King and I lacked the type of bombshells that characterized the series (as well as its directors, Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin) but did provide some small updates on life after Tiger King memedom. What, if anything, did we learn? (For those who haven’t seen, Tiger King spoilers ahead.)Several participants have aired grievances with their portrayals in the series, most notably the big cat owner Bhagavan “Doc” Antle and Joe’s arch-nemesis Baskin, both of whom did not participate in the special. Baskin in particular took issue with the charge lobbied by several in the series (and fans online) that she killed her ex-husband, Don Lewis, in Florida. (Police have never charged her with the crime, though a sheriff in Florida has reopened the investigation to date, tips have been fans with theories.)On Sunday’s special, Lowe, the business partner who implicated Joe in his murder-for-hire conviction and took over his zoo, disputed his characterization. “I think they tried to sensationalize the story a bit to give it a villain,” he said. McHale was a light interviewer, treating Lowe more as a charming character rather than someone with a shady criminal history he glossed over Lowe’s charges in Las Vegas (federal mail fraud and an illegal exotic animal business) but did ask about the couple’s nanny and Lowe’s wardrobe of leather jackets and Affliction T-shirts.Dial, Joe Exotic’s campaign manager for his presidential and Oklahoma gubernatorial runs, disputed Lowe’s claim of unfairness: “Truth hurts,” he said, calling the series “fair” and “balanced”.Saffery, a trans man who goes by Saff, said he wasn’t too concerned about criticism of the show for misgendering him. “I don’t think it bothered me as much as it bothered everybody else,” he said. “I didn’t really pay it any mind.”Joe’s ex-husband Finlay, who appeared mostly shirtless and with several missing teeth in the series (the result of meth use, which he discussed openly), told McHale he was not happy with his portrayal as “a drugged-out hillbilly”, since “that was not me then. At that time, I was four to five years clean.”Of course, most of the conversations revolved around Joe Exotic, the center of the series who has become a controversial hero to some viewers. High-profile fans such as Cardi B have suggested he was set up, and a question of pardoning Joe, legal name Joseph Maldonado-Passage, for his 22-year sentence in a murder-for-hire scheme against Baskin, has made it all the way to  Donald Trump. McHale asked most of his guests if they were more loyal to Joe or the animals Joe didn’t get any takers. “I think that justice was served, but I still don’t want to see that man die in prison,” said Saffery (though he said he would trust the tiger who bit his arm off over Joe).Several also spoke to the lingering damage from their time in the Joe Exotic universe. Dial revealed that he’s raising money for therapy to deal with the trauma of witnessing Joe’s husband Travis Maldonado accidentally shoot himself, point-blank, in 2017 – Dial’s expression the moment he realizes Maldonado’s prank has gone horribly wrong, captured on security footage, is one of the series’s darkest and most tragic moments. Kirkham, who produced Joe Exotic TV for several years, said the attention from the series has caught up with him in Norway, where he now lives, but so have the nightmares. Despite the newfound fame from the hit series, “I regret ever meeting Joe Exotic,” he said.The absence of the two major players in the series besides Joe, Baskin and Antle, went unmentioned by McHale perhaps it’s because both have roundly criticized the series. Antle dismissed Tiger King as “sensationalized entertainment with paid participants” in a series of Instagram and Facebook posts, while Baskin posted a 3,000-word defense against the claim she fed her ex-husband to tigers. Neither of these disputes were mentioned. Instead, McHale simply asked the Lowes whether they thought Baskin killed her ex-husband, as Joe and many in his orbit long claimed. Unsurprisingly, they said yes.Also missing from the special were James Garretson, Lowe’s former partner last seen riding into the sunset on a jetski, and Allen Glover, the alleged hitman hired by Joe to kill Baskin. Joe recently filed a malicious prosecution suit against both men, as well as Lowe and several others, in which he claims Lowe lied to authorities and planted evidence against him. This also went unmentioned.McHale jumped in to one of social media’s favorite games since the series aired: who should play these outrageous real-life figures in the Hollywood adaptation? A scripted miniseries is already in the works with Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon slated to play Baskin, but other roles remain uncast. In Facebook posts somehow written while in prison, Joe has suggested Brad Pitt should play him. Asked by McHale to cast himself, Reinke picked Matthew McConaughey, Kirkham offered Billy Bob Thornton and Saffery offered Brandon Baker of Johnny Tsunami fame.Tiger King has taken heat for losing the very real and tragic thread of big cat abuse and private zoos in the US amid the ostentatious personalities and petty drama of its characters, and the special mostly avoided the topic, as well. Lowe, Cowie and Kirkham each claimed they witnessed Joe kill healthy tigers, as an indictment of his character rather than private big cat zoos (Cowie, Joe’s former head keeper, now works for Lowe). “I never thought that they should be kept in captivity, but I knew the reality of it,” said Saffery when asked, briefly, about the tigers kept in Oklahoma. “And the reality of it is that they cannot be returned to the wild. And there’s not much of a wild to return to.”Kirkham described Joe’s actions toward animals as “unbelievably cruel”, and added that perhaps the series could direct attention to animal welfare (the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would regulate ownership of exotic cats in the US and has been pushed by Baskin for years, has been introduced to but not passed the US House).“The one thing that I think that can come out of this docuseries that is good: people are now going ‘free the animals’,” said Kirkham. “I think that’s the best thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f755628fad3c8255fb2a506c2224aae5d436371/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aafe4734f62c30a3a06752b5e08be390","title":"a house in the country how the pandemic exposes secret money","story":"I am among the lucky few with a place to stay outside New York City. My privilege is a reminder of a skewed societyThere’s been plenty of conversation about all the ways this pandemic has laid bare the brokenness of our systems: 27.5 million Americans without health insurance, the massive gaps in public health and healthcare funding, the two in five of us who couldn’t come up with $400 in an emergency.To many of us, none of this feels shocking – we’ve been grappling with the depth and breadth of America’s systemic failures for years. My husband and I are some of those people without health insurance. Our family just moved into a new apartment contingent on my husband’s new job but it is non-essential and can’t be done from home, so he’s not working. His paid time off is set to run out soon.This crisis has also laid bare the privileges some of us are afforded. In New York, people of a certain class are escaping to their country houses. Secret money, a friend of mine calls this, when acquaintances who complain along with you about the difficulty of making it in a certain profession or paying rent in New York City, and then you find out they have an extra house and their kids go to private school. But also, in my experience these last few weeks, this pandemic has exposed the privileges that some of us still have, regardless of how broke we are.In addition to being under 40 and without any underlying health conditions, in addition to our educations and my ability to work from home, we have access to my husband’s brother’s wife’s family’s New Jersey country house right now. I keep saying all those things – husband, brother, wife – to people when I tell them that we left the city to prove, I guess, that we’re not one of those families who have secret country houses of our own.I have been embarrassed by this access, in the same way I’m embarrassed to have parents who have money, which is to say, I find people having things that they did not earn, or people having so much more than most, to be sort of abhorrent without always knowing why I feel that way. Privilege is abhorrent, I think, because of how fundamentally skewed and unfair its allocation always is.My husband’s brother and his family also live in the city but left before we did last month. They also have small kids and are trying to work. They also lost a lot of income when everything shut down, and none of us is sure how we’ll survive as this unfolds. We’re all trying to find ways to make our lives work in the same ways we’ve always tried to make our lives work, which is to say, on the margins, patching things together, with the help of friends and family, with kids in the background always somewhere needing things. We’re taking turns parenting and cooking. We know there is a risk in coming together, more bodies and more chances of infection, but we’re not leaving the property except one of us every other week for groceries. Whether or not this is the right call, we’ve decided that it’s worth the risk.A couple of days before we left, we’d taken the children for a walk, and, angry at me over something, our seven-year-old had threatened to lick all the fences that we passed to make me mad. It’s a relief now to take the kids outside without telling them that they can’t touch anything, to have more inside space for them to do their remote learning and for them to play.The day we left the city, I kept asking my husband if he felt guilty. Of course, he said. But I’m also just so scared. It felt like we were abandoning our city, our friends. This weekend I got two phone calls about two friends losing loved ones to this virus. Four friends have been laid off and three others have been furloughed. People are losing jobs and houses, taking the subway to work still, unable to feed themselves or their kids. Every day we’re here I feel guilty, but also, every day, I feel a little bit less scared.Of course, none of this wipes the other worries. There is still the rent for our apartment, my husband is now filing for unemployment there are still grocery trips. I worry that the ends will never meet again for us after this crisis. I worry that we might have to leave the city and move in with my husband’s family in Florida, that I might lose my various jobs as a result. But worry has a different shape, I guess, when you know for sure that the problem is too big for you to fix it. When the problem is so obviously less consequential than all the loss that you see all around.For a while I thought this essay was about gratitude. I am grateful. I wake up every morning both numbed and bolstered by how lucky our family has been so far. But our luck is only further to the point of how completely unfair, uneven and arbitrary survival feels in this present moment. I hope more of us realize that, for many people in this country, it has always been like that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acc8555a0cce7175507dfa26392c868e4a0a73ef/0_175_5300_3182/master/5300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee79b4c58776346351989d192ec9bb6c","title":"bernie sanders endorses joe biden for president","story":"Bernie Sanders endorsed his former rival Joe Biden for president on Monday, during a surprise appearance on a live stream related to the US response to the coronavirus pandemic.Sanders’ support of the former vice-president comes at a critical moment in the 2020 campaign, as Biden attempts to unify the party after a fiercely contested primary. By throwing his weight behind Biden, Sanders, is sending a clear signal to his legions of loyal followers that they should align behind the party’s nominee to defeat Donald Trump.“Today, I am asking all Americans, I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,” the senator from Vermont said, appearing via live stream on a split screen next to Biden, who was hosting the broadcast.“We need you in the White House,” Sanders said. “We’ve got to make Trump a one-term president. I will do all that I can to make that happen.”Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary race last week after falling far behind Biden in the delegate count. In an effort to continue influencing the Democratic platform, he will remain on the ballot in states with remaining primaries to gain delegates.Biden, a former Delaware senator and vice-president now the presumptive Democratic nominee for the White House, thanked Sanders for his support.“You’ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America,” Biden told Sanders. “You don’t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror.”“If I am the nominee – which it looks like now you just made me – I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern,” Biden told Sanders.Biden still faces deep skepticism from young progressive voters, many of whom supported Sanders by lopsided margins. On Monday, Biden and Sanders announced that their staff had set up six taskforces to help find common ground on policy differences. Those groups will cover the economy, education, criminal justice, immigration, climate change and healthcare.“It’s no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences. And we’re not going to paper them over, that’s real,” Sanders said. But he expressed an optimism that the working groups would be able to forge policy agreements and concessions.Determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the party struggled to unify, Biden has already started to ramp up his outreach to the party’s left. In recent weeks, he has engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice.He has also made overt gestures, adopting a plan by his former rival, Elizabeth Warren, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system, embracing elements of Sanders’ tuition-free college proposal and unveiling a plan to lower the age of eligibility for the Medicare government health insurance program for seniors from 65 to 60.Though there are indications Biden will continue to move left on issues like climate change, he is unlikely to adopt Medicare for All, Sanders’ signature policy. Asked recently if the coronavirus outbreak changed his position on universal healthcare, Biden said it hadn’t and argued expanding the Affordable Care Act was still the most effective and efficient way to insure more Americans.In a sign of the work that lies ahead, the progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of Sanders’ most high-profile surrogates, called Biden’s Medicare proposal “almost insulting” and said he would have to go much further if he expects a full-throated endorsement.“The whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved – that’s how you know it’s working,” she said in an interview with the New York Times. “And if Biden is only doing things he’s comfortable with, then it’s not enough.”There are also limits to Sanders’ ability to deliver the support of his devoted followers, particularly those attracted to his outsider status as an independent railing against the political establishment. Though Sanders has been careful not to attack Biden in personal terms, some of his most visible backers continue to assail the former vice-president, raising questions about his mental acuity and overall fitness – a line of attack that Trump has also used against his likely opponent.Despite a hard-fought primary, the former competitors and one-time Senate colleagues displayed sincere affection for one another – a warm relationship Sanders never shared with his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.“I appreciate your friendship, and I promise you I will not let you down,” Biden told Sanders.In reply, Sanders said: “I know you are the kind of guy who is going to be inclusive. You want to bring people in – even people who disagree with you.”After exchanging questions on raising the minimum wage, and the US economy, they joked that they should end the live-cast by playing a game of chess.“We’ll bore everybody for a few hours,” Sanders said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb89a2f7e1d245d6387b18cdca32183","title":"tech giants struggle stem infodemic false coronavirus claims","story":"Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear onlineClick over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.Algorithms and user-generated content are out gatekeepers and fact checking are in.Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined.Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus.On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as “Covid-19” or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley’s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech, anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings.On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.A conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.“They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It’s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.”Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter’s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp’s strict new limits on message forwarding.The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.“There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.”It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased.Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.“We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said.Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.“We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f51afe3fc58ff6fb161ad60419b16845457030/0_290_6095_3656/master/6095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9f74c49ffe033221811530d470cb39","title":"a chance to do something meaningful the refugee chefs feeding health workers","story":"Despite facing personal hardship, a team of refugees has been delivering food to hospital staff in Malaysia’s capital during the coronavirus outbreakIn a small shop-turned-kitchen on the ground floor of a block of flats in Kuala Lumpur, Mohammad Jaber, 60, is preparing a feast: 20 portions of bechamel macaroni with minced chicken and lentil soup, accompanied by basbousa, a traditional semolina sweet cake he and his family often ate back in Syria before they fled to Malaysia in 2012.“We have so many desserts in Syria, but Malaysians seem to like basbousa the most,” his 21-year-old son, Tarek Jaber, says.Cooking is what Mohammad Jaber does. For almost 30 years before war broke out in Syria, he ran a restaurant in Damascus. Since 2013, he has been catering for restaurants and private events out of this small kitchen in Kuala Lumpur’s Taman Melati neighbourhood.Now though, Mohammad and his assistant Mahmoud Mohammed Salad, a 22-year-old Somalian, are feeding a different community: frontline health workers at the Ampang hospital, a public healthcare facility in the Malaysian capital. They are part of a group of 15 refugees from Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan who have joined forces to feed those on the frontline of the Covid-19 crisis. Here, cases have risen above 4,000, and 70 deaths have been recorded.Three weeks ago when the Malaysian government imposed a movement control order prohibiting the operation of all but essential services, two advocacy groups, the Syrian Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and Malaysian Beyond Borders Malaysia, put a call out to members of their community to form a refugee kitchen.The response was immediate and overwhelming. “Just on the same day, 10 chefs came forward. We said we had nothing to pay them, but they said they wanted to help,” says Hasan Al-Akraa who founded the Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and launched the refugee kitchen with Malaysian film-maker Mahi Ramakrishnan.“In the end, Mahi and I raised some funds and gave each of them enough for two days of groceries. They have responsibilities and children to feed.” They have now cooked more than 400 meals for nurses and doctors and other frontline staff since they opened their kitchen on 23 March.The first time he took part, Jaber – who now cooks wearing gloves and a protective face mask – made mandi chicken with rice, a popular Arabic staple.“My father feels it is his duty to provide services for the people of Malaysia who have been affected by this difficult situation,” Tarek says as his father stirs saucepans in the kitchen.The refugee chefs – 12 women and three men – start cooking in the morning and have the food ready by 11am. A volunteer or hired driver picks it up and takes it to the health workers at the hospital. Al-Akraa helps to coordinate all this from his room at Nottingham University’s Malaysia campus, or even while out running errands.Like Mohammad, Al-Akraa arrived in Kuala Lumpur from Syria in 2012, with his parents and four siblings. When he was 14, while trying to help his family, he was arrested by the Malaysian authorities for working at a restaurant without a permit. Although the Malaysian government works with NGOs to provide some assistance for refugees, it does not recognise them legally, meaning they have limited opportunities to study and work.In detention for nine days, Al-Akraa met three Rohingya refugees who inspired him to start helping others when he was free. “I told myself I shouldn’t be complaining. At least I have a UNHCR refugee card, so I would be released, but they came by boat and didn’t have any documentation.”At the refugee kitchen, the chefs rotate every day, and next on the rota is 43-year-old Elham Jaber Jasim Musawi. She prepares chicken macaroni – which she often cooks for her kids – with the help of her husband, Hussam Kadhim Younes Al Mohammedawi. Her 14-year-old son, Danial Husam Kadhim, had helped her with the shopping the day before.Musawi left Baghdad with her husband and children in 2014 when Islamic State escalated its attacks in her country. Now they live in a three-bedroom flat in Kuala Lumpur’s Ampang neighbourhood. Lockdown has been hard for the family. The children watch TV and play football indoors to pass the time and Musawi is worried that the family won’t be able to pay their rent. Both her job at a local school and that of her husband have been affected by the restrictions on movement.Still, she is happy to help. “This is an opportunity I wouldn’t have passed up for anything. It’s not always that we get a chance to do something meaningful. We are all thankful to the doctors and all other medical workers who sacrifice their lives to keep us safe,” she says.The food is gratefully received by the nurses and doctors.“Even though they’re not from our country, they want to help us while we carry out our work,” says Shuhaida Shuib, 42, a nurse at Ampang hospital. “I think that’s very compassionate and it means a lot in these difficult times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ce3e00dd946c9b49ff97ca35efa7c5b2517c48/0_34_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=152c642f951d14496c04c05d207851de","title":"bono helps irelands search for coronavirus medical supplies","story":"U2 singer lobbies South Korean president and corporate bosses to secure equipmentIn the global scramble for medical equipment and diagnostic kits to fight the coronavirus, Ireland has found an edge: Bono.The U2 singer has lobbied South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, and corporate titans including Apple’s Tim Cook, to help find personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies for Ireland’s health service.Moon’s office tweeted on Sunday that it had received a letter from Bono and that the president’s spokesman, Kang Min-suk, would respond in writing. The tweet noted that Bono had been nominated for the Nobel peace prize. The rock star met South Korea’s president last December after performing in the country.South Korea makes PPE and other medical kit that many countries are seeking to combat Covid-19.Ireland’s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, contacted Bono in late March to enlist him in a public-private collaboration that last week obtained supplies from China, the Irish Times reported.In addition to Moon and Cook, Bono has contacted Jack Ma, the head of the Chinese retailer Alibaba, Marc Benioff of the software giant Salesforce and Doug McMillon of Walmart.“I just don’t think this is the moment for U2 to be doing a sort of Kumbaya thing. It just doesn’t feel right for me – it feels like a time for action rather than words,” the singer told the , which described the collaboration as an example of Ireland’s “soft power”.Liam Casey, the founder of the tech supply chain business PCH, which is part of the public-private alliance, said Bono’s lobbying had clinched new suppliers including a top executive at the Chinese tech giant Tencent. “The power of Bono on the ground – I was able to go to some of the bigger companies and that really opened the doors for us.”U2 has pledged to donate €10m (£8.7m) to support healthcare workers in Ireland, which is expected on Monday to pass 10,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. It has recorded 334 deaths.Last month Bono performed his first new music since 2017 with a song inspired by quarantined Italians. He posted the new song, Let Your Love Be Known, to his Instagram account and dedicated it to health workers and anyone who was “in a tight spot and still singing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb04114fe4a9443e2a7f3abc4fa79bfc039eb29/95_377_2968_1781/master/2968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9890b138be3dc436c6fc783f834b57ca","title":"britain on target for 100000 coronavirus tests a day says no 10","story":"Figures show less than a fifth of target figure for coronavirus tests are being carried outDowning Street has insisted it remains on target to ensure 100,000 tests a day for coronavirus by the end of the month – despite the latest figures showing only a fifth of this number are being carried out.At the daily briefing for lobby journalists, the prime minister’s spokesman disclosed the statistics while defending the decision to allow Michael Gove’s daughter to be tested for the illness – at a time when some NHS and care home staff are still waiting to be tested themselves.The test came back negative, meaning that Gove was no longer obliged to self-isolate at home with the rest of his family. The fact that Gove was no longer self-isolating emerged when he was seen jogging in a park near his London home.On 25 March, at the last prime minister’s questions before the Easter recess , Boris Johnson told MPs that the government was “massively increasing” testing up to 25,000 per day. Later that day he told a press conference that “hopefully very soon” he wanted to reach a target of 250,000 tests a day, although when Matt Hancock, the health secretary, set a formal target to be achieved by the end of April, he settled on 100,000 tests a day.At the Monday briefing, the PM’s spokesman said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Sunday, 18,000 tests were carried out in Great Britain.He said that 2,630 of those tests involved NHS staff being tested at drive-through sites, and that a total of 42,812 NHS staff and their family members had now been tested.That marked “significant progress on where we were a little over a week ago”, the spokesman claimed.When it was put to him that the government was still a long way off the 100,000-a-day target set by Hancock, the spokesman said he did not accept that. “New capacity is coming on stream all the time,” he said, stressing that there were now 23 drive-through centres open where NHS staff could get tested.It also emerged that Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, had arranged for his daughter to be tested after she developed coronavirus symptoms. The test came back negative, meaning that Gove was no longer obliged to self-isolate at home with the rest of his family.The spokesman said this had been done on the advice of Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and was justified on the grounds that Gove was one of the figures leading the government’s response to coronavirus.Asked why Gove could not work from home, the spokesman said Gove chaired one of the key ministerial groups dealing with coronavirus (one covering the public sector) and it was “beneficial” for him to be able to go into the office.At the briefing it also emerged that the cabinet as a whole may not be involved in the decision, due to be formally taken this week, to extend the lockdown announced by Johnson exactly three weeks ago.Although it normally meets on a Tuesday, no meeting has been scheduled for this week. With Johnson recovering at Chequers after his spell in intensive care, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is deputising in his absence. The spokesman said the main work coordinating the government’s response to coronavirus was being done by the morning No 10 meeting, chaired by Raab, and by the four coronavirus ministerial groups.It is seen as inevitable that the lockdown will be extended, and No 10 said the reasoning would be formally explained when the decision is formally announced, which has to be by Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e775ab3b92e68c2fd0862b2d3ef4345302e991/0_252_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f79c75775d8f455e84706cb8e6408dac","title":"coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting muslims spread in india","story":"Attacks and boycotts escalate amid false claims that Muslim group to blame for epidemicThe men who beat Mehboob Ali did so without mercy. Dragging him to a field in the village of Harewali, on the fringes of north-west Delhi, the group hit him with sticks and shoes until he bled from his nose and ears. Ali was a Muslim, recently returned home from a religious gathering, and the Hindu mob was quite certain he was part of a so-called Islamic conspiracy to spread coronavirus to Hindus nationwide. His attackers believed the devout 22-year-old must be punished before he carried out “corona jihad”.The allegations were entirely false, but according to video footage and his family, the men who beat Ali on 5 April were in little doubt of his guilt, demanding: “Tell us who else is behind this conspiracy.” Ali was then taken to a nearby Hindu temple and told to renounce Islam and convert to Hinduism before they would allow him to go to hospital. Five days after the attack Ali’s family was still in fear of also being accused of spreading the virus. “If we file a police case, the Hindus will not let us live in the village,” said one family member, who asked not to be named. Police confirmed that due to his attendance at a Muslim convention in Bhopal a few weeks back, Ali was being held in the isolation ward of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital in Delhi as a “corona suspect”, though he had no symptoms.The attack on Ali is symptomatic of the growing demonisation of India’s Muslim community, who are being accused, without any basis, of conducting a malevolent campaign to spread Covid-19 to the Hindu majority.Already a minority under attack – it is just weeks since Hindu mobs attacked Muslims in religious riots in Delhi – Muslims have now seen their businesses across India boycotted, volunteers distributing rations called “coronavirus terrorists”, and others accused of spitting in food and infecting water supplies with the virus. Posters have appeared barring Muslims from entering certain neighbourhoods in states as far apart as Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh.The troubles began when the gathering of an Islamic missionary organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, held in mid-March in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Nizamuddin, was singled out by police and government as being responsible for the spread of coronavirus across India. The convention, which had been given the go-ahead by the Delhi authorities, was attended by about 8,000 people, including hundreds of foreigners. It soon became apparent that many at the convention had unknowingly picked up Covid-19 and brought it back to towns and villages across India.Across the country, police were ordered to round up anyone associated with the organisation. So far, more than 27,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined in about 15 states. In Uttar Pradesh, the police offered up to 10,000 rupees (£105) for information on anyone who had attended the gathering.In a statement this week, the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid-19 group said “the available data does not support the speculation” that the blame for the coronavirus epidemic in India lies mainly with Tablighi Jamaat. The scientists emphasised that while testing for coronavirus is extremely low across India, a disproportionate number have been of members of Tablighi Jamaat, as per a government order, therefore heavily skewing the figures.Yet the test results were swiftly seized upon by members of the ruling ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who claimed Tablighi Jamaat members had intended to infect millions as part of an Islamic conspiracy and were carrying out “corona terrorism”.Senior BJP leaders accused Tablighi Jamaat of carrying out a “Talibani crime”, described their members as “human bombs, but in the guise of coronavirus patients”, and called for Tablighi Jamaat leaders to be both hanged and shot. Kapil Mishra, a local BJP leader notorious for hate speeches, tweeted: “Tablighi Jamaat people have begun spitting on the doctors and other health workers. It’s clear, their aim is to infect as many people as possible with coronavirus and kill them.”Though quickly debunked, the rumours of Tablighi Jamaat members refusing to go into quarantine, assaulting hospital staff and throwing bottles of urine at Hindus quickly spread.Hashtags such as “coronaJihad”, “CoronaTerrorism” and “CoronaBombsTablighi” began to trend on Twitter in India. Mainstream Indian media repeatedly asserted that Tablighi Jamaat members were coronavirus “superspreaders”.Dr Zafarul-Islam Khan, chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, said that while Tablighi Jamaat had been shortsighted in holding the convention, there were “dozens of examples of government, political parties and other religious groups who also flouted the coronavirus restrictions and gathered in large numbers”.He added: “But the whole focus is being directed only on Muslims. In the past few days, we have noted a new wave of attacks on Muslims across the country. There is talk of social boycott of Muslims, harassment of Muslims by Hindutva groups and Muslims are even being harassed by police in various areas.”There has been a concentration of attacks against Muslims in Karnataka, where a BJP MP, Anant Kumar Hegde, has denounced Tablighi Jamaat as terrorists. Shortly after, an audio clip began to be shared widely over WhatsApp, urging people not to allow Muslim fruit and vegetable sellers into their areas, claiming they were spreading the virus through their produce.Sayed Tabrez, 23, and his mother, Zareen Taj, 39, were among seven Muslim volunteers who were assaulted by a gang of local BJP members on 4 and 6 April, as they tried to distribute food to impoverished people in the Marathahalli and Dasarahalli districts of Karnataka.“Some 20 local BJP members came on motorbikes and started shouting at us, saying, ‘You are not allowed to give out rations – you are Muslims so you all are terrorists spreading the disease. We know you are spitting in the rations and have come from Tablighi Jamaat to spread the virus’,” said Tabrez. Two days later, about 25 local BJP members followed them in vehicles before attacking Tabrez, his mother and the other volunteers with bats. Police have since arrested two people.It is not an isolated incident. Manohar Elavarthy of the NGO Swaraj Abhiyan, which has been distributing lockdown rations, said dozens of attacks had been carried out against their Muslim volunteers in the past few days, including some by police.In Mangalore this week, posters started appearing that said Muslims were no longer allowed in certain neighbourhoods. “No Muslim trader will be allowed access to our hometown until the coronavirus is completely gone,” read a sign in Alape. In the Hindu-dominated village of Ankanahalli, a video seen by the  shows Mahesh, the village panchayat president, issuing a warning that if any Hindu in the village is caught fraternising with a Muslim “you will be fined 500 to 1,000 rupees”.The hijacking of coronavirus as an excuse for discrimination comes after a growing state-sponsored campaign to turn Muslims into second-class citizens in India, as part of the BJP’s agenda of Hindu nationalism. Attacks on Muslims have become commonplace and the recent citizenship amendment act, passed by the BJP in December, prompted millions to take to the streets in protest, saying it discriminated against Muslims.The situation got so bad last week that it prompted Equality Labs, a US-based south Asian human rights organisation researching Islamophobic hate speech, to release a statement urging the World Health Organization to “issue further guidelines against Covid-19 hate speech and disconnect it to religious communities”.“Just weeks after the Delhi pogrom where hundreds of Muslim houses and shops were vandalised, an uptick in misinformation and harmful communal language are leading to violence,” said Equality Labs’ executive director, Thenmozhi Soundararajan. “The threat of another pogrom still looms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/835ca0de47d1b0c4f370afaa524e8be3d0abcf2d/1075_407_1233_740/master/1233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d786d2fecdcdda8a766f5957be0982d7","title":"how did the coronavirus start where did it come from how did it spread humans was it really bats pangolins wuhan animal market","story":"It’s likely Covid-19 originated in bats, scientists say. But did it then spread to pangolins and humans?In the public mind, the origin story of coronavirus seems well fixed: in late 2019 someone at the now world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was infected with a virus from an animal.The rest is part of an awful history still in the making, with Covid-19 spreading from that first cluster in the capital of China’s Hubei province to a pandemic that has killed about 80,000 people so far.Stock footage of pangolins – a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater – have made it on to news bulletins, suggesting this animal was the staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.But there is uncertainty about several aspects of the Covid-19 origin story that scientists are trying hard to unravel, including which species passed it to a human. They’re trying hard because knowing how a pandemic starts is a key to stopping the next one.Prof Stephen Turner, head of the department of microbiology at Melbourne’s Monash University, says what’s most likely is that virus originated in bats.But that’s where his certainty ends, he says.On the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan live animal market from an interaction between an animal and a human, Turner says: “I don’t think it’s conclusive by any means.”“Part of the problem is that the information is only as good as the surveillance,” he says, adding that viruses of this type are circulating all the time in the animal kingdom.The fact that the virus has infected a tiger in a New York zoo shows how viruses can move around between species, he says. “Understanding the breadth of species this virus can infect is important as it helps us narrow down down where it might have come from.”Scientists say it is highly likely that the virus came from bats but first passed through an intermediary animal in the same way that another coronavirus – the 2002 Sars outbreak – moved from horseshoe bats to cat-like civets before infecting humans.One animal implicated as an intermediary host between bats and humans is the pangolin. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says they are “the most illegally traded mammal in the world” and are prized for their meat and the claimed medicinal properties of their scales.As reported in Nature, pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items being sold in Wuhan, although this omission could be deliberate as it’s illegal to sell them.“Whether the poor pangolin was the species at which it jumped, it’s not clear,” Turner says. “It’s either mixed in something else, mixed in a poor pangolin, or it’s jumped into people and evolved in people.”Prof Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, was a co-author on a Nature study that examined the likely origins of the virus by looking at its genome. On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is “still uncertain”.One statistical study looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons.Another study claimed to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans.The study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the Covid-19 origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human.“Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,” the study said.This might be another reason to doubt the established story.Prof Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental “cannot be ruled out” but that possibility “seems less likely” because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment.Perlman told  Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they “are not proven to be the key intermediary”.So-called wet markets – where live animals are traded – have been implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, in particular Sars.Dr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on Covid-19’s origins have stepped off from what was known from the past.Baker says what is “very likely” is that the virus originated in a bat. “It’s a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.”“These wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,” she says. “It’s an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.”Turner adds: “We’ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b6a23a20cdf2cc508402b5a7f5d7ffa3954017b/0_328_5551_3331/master/5551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25f04c22aa13a55bd00c1d4ebeabab13","title":"increase in speeding incidents on uks quiet lockdown roads","story":"One driver clocked at 151mph as speeding offences double, putting pedestrians at risk Motorists have been caught driving at “extreme speeds” on otherwise-quiet roads over the Easter weekend, police have said, including one driver who was clocked at 151mph on the M1 near London.The number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled in some parts of the UK since the start of the coronavirus lockdown, increasing the risk to pedestrians taking their daily exercise.The politan police said the average speed on some 20mph roads had risen to 37mph as some drivers were tempted to put their foot down with fewer vehicles on the road.However, police warned that some drivers were taking advantage of the quieter motorways by travelling at breakneck speeds. Supt Andy Cox, the Met’s head of road and transport policing, said on Monday that some motorists were still travelling at “extreme speeds” in London.He posted footage of a police chase involving a driver caught doing 151mph on the M1 at the weekend, while another was spotted doing 97mph on the A10.In Greater Manchester, police arrested a Mercedes driver for travelling at what appeared to be more than 100mph on a 40mph stretch of the A580 East Lancashire Road on Saturday.The driver was “totally unaware of the police car behind him”, the police tweeted, adding that he was “off to court” for speeding and breaching the coronavirus lockdown. The driver of a VW Golf was also caught speeding, at 106mph, on the M61 on Saturday, according to Greater Manchester police.But police chiefs have raised concerns that people are becoming restless and bored after three weeks of lockdown, leading to some getting back in their cars.Burnham said: “That will be worrying in any event, but it’s particularly worrying when more families are out and about taking walks, people are running, cycling, just more people on our pavements. The worry is with so many people out taking exercise on the pavements more crowded than normal. This poses risks to public safety.”A motorbike rider was arrested last week after being caught speeding at 150mph along the M23 in West Sussex.Giles York, the chief constable of Sussex police, said at the weekend that a number of his officers had been “verbally abused, spat and coughed on in the line of duty” and that there were still a few people who “think they are above or outside” the lockdown regulations.He added: “Please respect the work of my officers and my staff.

Please follow the simple message: stay at home and save lives.”In the West Midlands, police seized nine off-road bikes and arrested a 15-year-old boy and three men for “turning deserted streets into racetracks” over the bank holiday. They said the group were “running amok on our quieter roads during the government restrictions”.John Apter, the chair of the Police Federation, which represents frontline officers, said it was “pretty outrageous” that people were flouting the lockdown.Speaking to LBC radio, Apter said the authorities would be justified in closing parks or beaches if a minority failed to break the lockdown: “The problem is if people ignore the rules and we find that these parks and beaches are getting packed with people – and it’s clearly not daily exercise where they’re having BBQs or picnics or sunbathing – I think the local authorities are right to react to that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f5e7973916fc6dd332ad01e42928e315b14e8ab/0_20_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5a8485edfbddfb5ddb67a8701cf4293","title":"macron france remain strict lockdown for another month","story":"Emmanuel Macron admits failings and tells nation that end to crisis not yet in sightFrance’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has announced that the country will remain in coronavirus lockdown for another month.In a national address on Monday evening, he said that only by respecting the confinement rules would the battle against Covid-19 be won.Macron said France would start returning to normal life on 11 May, if citizens were “civic, responsible and respected the rules” – and if the number of cases of coronavirus continued to drop.“We have to continue our efforts the more the rules are respected the more lives will be saved. That is why I am announcing the strict lockdown will continue until Monday 11 May.”“I appreciate the effort I am asking of you,” he said, adding: “There is new hope but nothing is won at the moment … the epidemic is not under control.”It was Macron’s fourth televised address since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis and expectations were high, not just that he would make concrete announcements but that he would give some direction and reassurance.Hospital admissions and death rates appear to have levelled off – though as Jérôme Salomon, the head of France’s health authority, has repeated, they remain at a “high level” – and the French were keen to know if and when the four-week lockdown restrictions may be eased.In a 30-minute speech marked by a tone of humility, Macron gave an explanation, a response and a calendar for the next few weeks.He admitted several times that there had been failings in dealing with the pandemic, particularly with the lack of masks and equipment, but promised that by 11 May there would be enough tests for “the elderly, health workers and the most vulnerable” and masks for everyone.“Were we prepared? No. Clearly not enough. There were failings, there was a lack of material,” he said.Macron added that the coming four weeks would be used to obtain more tests, masks and equipment, and organise financial aid not only for businesses but for those families in a precarious situation.“These are difficult days and we are now feeling afraid and anxious for our parents and ourselves,” Macron said.From 11 May, creches, schools, colleges and lycées will be “progressively opened” as a priority, he said.“Many children are missing out of school and there is an inequality in that there are those who don’t have access to the internet and can’t be helped by their parents.”While schools will open from 11 May, Macrons said restaurants, cafes, hotels, museums and cultural sites must stay closed and large festivals and events may only be allowed after mid-July.Macron made reference to EU solidarity and the need to support African countries, including the possibility of cancelling their debt.He said France’s borders with non-EU countries would remain closed. This is not thought to include the UK, as Britain is still in the Brexit transition period.He concluded: “We have to reinvent ourselves, and me first of all … We are vulnerable. When can we hope for an end to this? I understand you have many questions and I would like to answer all of them. But I say in all humility, we don’t have definitive answers today.“We will share with you what we know and what we don’t know, we will come out of this, but we still have several months of living with this virus.”Macron added: “Take care of yourselves and each other and we will get through this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32fad2437d63d944763052e7a23768b15434defb/494_325_4956_2974/master/4956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad5b3e526fc5c2f9f171ede726f142c0","title":"raab suggests uk lockdown could last at least another month","story":"PM’s deputy backs chief scientific adviser, saying public must stay in until peak has passedPeople in Britain have been warned that there is “a long way to go” before lockdown measures to curb the spread of coronavirus are likely to be relaxed, with the UK’s chief scientific adviser suggesting they could last another month.As the country entered its fourth week of rules compelling the public to stay at home except for essential work, shopping or exercise, Sir Patrick Vallance said he expected the number of deaths from coronavirus to continue rising this week before hitting a plateau that could last up to three weeks.Only when the UK was “firmly on the other side” would it be safe to relax some of the restrictions, Vallance told the the daily Downing Street press briefing, implying that the lockdown measures in place could easily last another month.His comments, coming three weeks after Boris Johnson announced a lockdown, were backed by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who said it was “absolutely crucially important” not to let up at this point.Raab, who is deputising for the prime minister while he recovers at Chequers from the Covid-19 infection that led to him spending a week in hospital, said he spoke to Johnson on Saturday.When the prime minister announced the lockdown on 23 March, he said it would be reviewed after three weeks. However, ministers are now looking at proposals that would involve the restrictions being removed gradually, with some of the physical distancing measures possibly being maintained for many months.The World Health Organization said on Monday that restrictions should be lifted slowly and not “all at once” to avoid a resurgence of the virus, and only if appropriate measures are in place, including “significant” capacity for contact tracing.The government must decide by Thursday this week whether to renew the three-week lockdown period. Raab said a formal decision on how to ease the lockdown would be taken after ministers had received evidence from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage).He said: “We don’t expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point and we won’t until we’re confident, as confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made.”The final decision would be signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting attended by the heads of the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who are expected to back the approach adopted by Westminster.On Monday the Department of Health and Social Care said 11,329 hospital patients in the UK had now died from coronavirus, up 717 from the previous day’s total. The total number of coronavirus deaths is higher because the daily figure does not include deaths in care homes or private homes the Office for National Statistics will release non-hospital deaths on Tuesday.Vallance said there would be a further increase in the death rate. He went on: “Thereafter we should see a plateau as the effects of social distancing come through. That plateau may last for some time and begin to decrease.” Asked what he meant by “some time”, he said the plateau could last for “two or three weeks”.He said if the lockdown measures were relaxed too early there was a danger that the infection rate could shoot back up. “We’ll look and see where the peak is and when we are firmly the other side of it in terms of numbers coming down,” Vallance said.“Only at that stage do you start looking at what measures might be released and how they might be released. It would be a complete waste of everything that everyone has had to do until now … if we were to rapidly reverse that and lead to a re-emergence of this.”Making the same point, Raab said: “We’ve still got a long way to go … We’ve still not passed the peak of this virus.”The foreign secretary added: “It’s absolutely crucially important that we do not take our eye off the ball or the public’s focus on the thing that has been a success so far in relative terms – which is our ability through widespread support for our social distancing measures to deprive this virus of the means to spread.”Earlier it emerged that the cabinet as a whole may not be involved in the formal decision to extend the lockdown, and for how long.Although it normally meets on a Tuesday, no meeting has been scheduled for this week, the prime minister’s spokesman told the daily lobby briefing. He said the main work coordinating the government’s response to coronavirus was being done at the regular morning No 10 meeting, which is attended by a small number of senior ministers and is referred to as the “war cabinet’” by officials.Raab is chairing it in the prime minister’s absence. Other key decisions are being taken by the four coronavirus ministerial groups, the spokesman said.Johnson left St Thomas’ hospital in London on Sunday after a week as an inpatient including three nights in intensive care. There was a 48-hour period when things “could have gone either way”, he said of his treatment.He is recuperating at Chequers in Buckinghamshire – the official retreat for serving prime ministers – where he has been reunited with his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds. A spokesman said Johnson was not doing any government work there and was “focusing on recovery”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/635b2266f4a751bfe2ca78fd5dc77251e7e2e35e/0_113_3400_2039/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=389a3f1a9546658d7fe07f1520fe1ba4","title":"uk missed three chances to join eu scheme to bulk buy ppe","story":"Exclusive: Britain did not take part in €1.5bn order for kit to protect against Covid-19 despite shortages in NHSBritain missed three opportunities to be part of an EU scheme to bulk-buy masks, gowns and gloves and has been absent from key talks about future purchases, the  can reveal, as pressure grows on ministers to protect NHS medics and care workers on the coronavirus frontline.European doctors and nurses are preparing to receive the first of €1.5bn (£1.3bn) worth of personal protective equipment (PPE) within days or a maximum of two weeks through a joint procurement scheme involving 25 countries and eight companies, according to internal EU documents.The EU’s swift work has led to offers of medical equipment, including masks, overalls and goggles, in excess of the number requested, a spokesman for the European commission said. The EU is separately establishing stockpiles within member states, with the first being set up in Romania.The development comes as anger grows over PPE shortages in Britain, with particular concerns at the weekend over stocks of full-sleeve gowns running out. The gowns are designed to resist droplets which can spread coronavirus and were shown to be highly effective at protecting medics in Italy.On Monday Dominic Raab, acknowledged PPE shortages – rather than distribution issues only – for the first time.The foreign secretary, who is deputising for the prime minister as Boris Johnson recovers from Covid-19, told the daily Downing Street briefing that cost was not an issue but admitted to problems with PPE supply due to “a competitive market out there”.He declined to apologise, saying only that 16m items of equipment were delivered over the bank holiday weekend. “We are straining every sinew to roll them out even further and even faster,” he said.The UK government has previously said it was unable to join the EU’s procurement schemes as it had not received an email of invitation.As a result, the government missed out on mass procurement of medical ventilators, and has called on UK manufacturers to build tens of thousands more. But it has also not been involved in two rounds of bulk purchasing of PPE, which were launched by the EU on 28 February and 17 March.The EU’s procurement of 28 February initially failed due to a lack of interest from suppliers but was relaunched on 15 March, providing additional time for the UK to get involved if it had chosen to do so.It is understood that officials in Whitehall only realised after those three rounds had been put out to tender that they had not received invitations to join the Joint Procurement Agreement steering committee where the orders are organised.The UK only took part in its first meeting on joint procurement on 19 March after informing the commission that emails of invitation were being sent to an outdated address, the  has learned.Despite that belated show of interest, British officials did not attend a separate meeting of health officials on 25 March where participants were invited to spell out their requirements for future purchases to the commission by the next day.The UK is also not involved in joint procurement of laboratory equipment. The EU is also planning joint procurement of therapies for coronavirus, but the UK is yet to state its position on its involvement.Shortages of protective equipment have triggered anxiety, alarm and fear among NHS medics and care home staff. The death toll among doctors and nurses continues to rise, with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, saying on Saturday that 19 NHS workers had died. He said it was “impossible” to say when hospitals would have all they needed but added: “We aren’t aware of any links from shortages of PPE to any of these deaths.”New examples of the shortage of equipment seen by the  include a district nurse in London being issued with just three disposable masks for a week and a care home nurse in Devon claiming her employer was limiting drinks to every four hours to avoid multiple changes of masks and gloves.The Royal College of Nursing has added to the pressure by advising nurses they should refuse to treat patients with Covid-19 “as a last resort” if they could not access the full PPE they needed.The EU procurement scheme has not been entirely successful, however. While deliveries of masks, gowns and gloves will be made in tranches over the next two to 18 weeks, the procurement of ventilators will be slow, according to a leaked EU document.“Companies indicated long delivery times, from 10 to 52 weeks,” the commission warned member states of the £690m purchase.A spokesman for the commission said: “Some of the equipment, depending on the specifications of the contracts, could be available within a few weeks after member states place orders with the industry. However, taking into account the difficult situation of the market some products require more time to be produced and delivered.“Overall, for the joint procurements launched for personal protective equipment, the commission has received offers for all categories of equipment requested, some even exceeding the amounts requested. The commission has also drawn up an initial needs assessment and will be working with member states to further detail and prioritise their necessities.”Donna Kinnair, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “This week, ministers and officials must get a grip and stop putting nursing staff in this dire situation. Too many are phoning me to say things they needed were missing or in short supply. Nursing staff are dying from this virus and too many risks are still being run.”The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We are working round the clock with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the army to ensure the supply of PPE over the coming weeks and months and will give our NHS and the social care sector everything they need to tackle this pandemic – including working with countries around the globe.“We are also working with a number of firms to scale up production of existing UK ventilator manufacturers, as well as designing and manufacturing new products from scratch, and procuring thousands more machines from overseas.“We will continue to work with European countries and others in order to make sure that we can increase the capacity within the NHS, and we will consider participating in future EU joint procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bcb50f96f9cb1688a0e5bde03e055ad01a39f7f/0_335_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98204d01be3322f41330eb8edb21a6fa","title":"uk scraps plans to buy thousands of bluesky ventilators coronavirus","story":"Model by Renault and Red Bull F1 teams found unsuitable for complex treatment of coronavirusA plan to buy thousands of medical ventilators from a group including the Renault and Red Bull Formula One teams has been cancelled amid signs that symptoms specific to Covid-19 could make building new devices more difficult than hoped.The NHS needs to increase its stock of ventilators from 10,000 to at least 18,000 and the government has been scrambling to procure enough in time for a peak of cases expected by the end of the month.Efforts to source more have involved enlisting UK manufacturers, importing devices from overseas and even borrowing them from the set of the BBC medical drama Holby City.The Cabinet Office confirmed that a provisional request for thousands of one model, called BlueSky, would not go ahead because clinicians feared the device was not sufficiently complex to be suitable for treating Covid-19. understands that this ventilator, formerly known as Remora, involved a collaboration between the Renault and Red Bull Formula One teams. They were working with a small Essex-based specialist, Lifeline Technologies, whose founder, Dr Alastair Darwood, designs medical devices.The devices had not been formally ordered or paid for because they were yet to receive regulatory approval.While the BlueSky machine was capable of ventilating patients, clinicians on the government’s technical design authority and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found it was not suited for treating Covid-19.This is because fluid builds up in the lungs of coronavirus patients faster than in people suffering from other ailments. The devices must be switched to a different setting while the patient’s lungs are being cleared and the BlueSky machine did not lend itself to frequent changes.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the decision had been taken “following a reassessment of the product’s viability in light of the ever-developing picture around what is needed to most effectively treat Covid-19”.Formula One teams are assisting with several ventilator projects under the umbrella title Project Pitlane. A spokesperson for Formula One said: “The F1 team project leads for BlueSky – Aston Martin Red Bull Racing and Renault DP World F1 Team – have shown brilliant dedication and skill throughout the project and should feel proud of the work they have undertaken to develop a new device with an NHS entrepreneur and will continue to provide vital contributions to Project Pitlane.”One source familiar with multiple ventilator projects said the issues that affected BlueSky showed why regulators could not rush through new devices.“People are still testing these things in clinical trials and our understanding is evolving every day, so that might be part of why it’s taking a bit longer,” they said.The MHRA approval process can take years but officials are working round the clock to move faster.One device, made by Oxfordshire-based Penlon with backing from manufacturers such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce, is expected to win approval soon because it varies only slightly from proven machines.The Ventilator Challenge UK consortium has offered to build 5,000 of these and some have already been delivered to hospitals where doctors are performing clinical trials.The same consortium has also delivered the first of up to 10,000 ParaPAC ventilators made by Luton-based Smiths Medical, which are already approved for use.But tens of thousands of the machines that have won provisional orders from the government are yet to be rubber-stamped.They include 10,000 of the Zephyr Plus model made by the defence firm Babcock and German medical device specialist Drägerwerk. The Zephyr Plus has the advantage of being based on existing designs.Dyson’s brand new CoVent prototype is not thought to have undergone rigorous testing yet, while another device made by a Cambridge-based company called Science Group is also untried."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:At least 1,911,407 people worldwide have been infected, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in the US, who have been tracking official data and media reports, meaning the tally is likely to be an underestimate.

It covers a comprehensive list of topics and is the crème de la casts when it comes to education.Listeners can choose from almost 400 episodes on topics that range from leadership in education, literacy, to European education and psychology.Other episodes dole out practical advice on school tour preparation, the dreaded inspector and debates the merits-or lack of- of homework. The episodes vary in length with some breaking the hour mark, but most are at the aurally appealing length of 30 minutes or under.The Learning Scientists PodcastThis US podcast is aimed at teachers and students throughout all areas of education. It discusses evidence- based practice and learning, by examining cognitive psychology and its application in education.Each episode deals with one strategy that might be helpful to students, including retrieval practice, dual-coding, spaced practice and concrete examples.The episode on retrieval practice might be of interest to students looking to fine tune their study habits as they prepare for exam season.Another episode on literacy and making mistakes, identifies the positive role mistakes play in a students’ learning along with some of the mistakes teachers can make when teaching literacy.The episodes vary in length from 10-30 minutes long. There is an accompanying website where listeners can also download a poster related to the strategy discussed along with other support materials.The Hamlet PodcastIt will come as no surprise that there are a multitude of podcasts available on all things Shakespeare, but The Hamlet Podcast, created by theatre and opera director Conor Hanratty, stands out for several reasons.Hanratty has mastered the magic of three: content, analysis and brevity. The 10-minute episodes are long enough to give you an understanding and short enough to keep you engaged and coming back. There is also a distinct lack of gimmick as he lets Shakespeare’s language do the talking.Hanratty was inspired by Frank Delaney’s podcast on Ulysses. “It’s called “Re:Joyce” and it attempted to unpack and unlock the novel in about seven years’ worth of five-minute episodes. Sadly, Frank died before it was completed - a real tragedy,” says Hanratty.In his podcast, Hanratty ides Hamlet into segments of about 20 lines for what he expects to be about 200 episodes and it is listened to by teachers and students alike.The Knowledge ProjectThis podcast offers a veritable buffet of food for educational thought. Each episode discusses theories and interventions that may challenge, support or change educational practices.The discussion-based format explores topics such as memorisation, neuroscience, and empathic approaches to discipline.Trialled and Tested: evidence-based educationTrialled and Tested is a UK based podcast with evidence-based education as its focus. One recent episode examines the impact social and emotional learning in primary school can have on a student’s academic performance as well as the positive impact it has on mental health and wellbeing.Tes - the education podcastStaying with the UK, the Tes podcast has over 400 episodes for teachers from all areas of education. While some of the episodes are aimed specifically towards those teaching in the UK, most episodes have a broad appeal.There are also some useful episodes for newly qualified teachers on the highs and lows of your first year of teaching or advice on how to update your CV.Playing with Research in Health and Physical EducationThis American podcast is aimed at teachers interested in health and physical education.It discusses research on topics such as physical literacy, game sense and use of technology in PE. The show also looks at the PE curriculums from a variety of countries, including Norway, Canada and Australia.One of the more recent episodes discussed the Irish Primary PE curriculum and may be of interest to teachers wishing to learn more about the proposals in the new primary curriculum framework.The Critter ShedThe nature-based podcast describes itself as a ‘podcast with legs’ and while its content’s appeal is not limited to those working in a classroom, it will be of interest to teachers with an interest in bioersity and wishing to upskill themselves on all things creepy crawlie.The episodes are presented by Collie Ennis, a science research associate with Trinity College Dublin and Colette Kinsella.Pol-Soc PodcastJerome Devitt, teacher of Politics and Society, has created a podcast that includes the student voice. Each episode deals with topics from Brexit to the Council of Europe. Devitt started the podcast as a resource for teachers and students starting out with the new subject.“It was a brand-new subject and there were very few resources for teachers and students themselves to use, so part of it was to create a community if knowledge that we would all share,” says Devitt. Student voice and gender balance are observed in each episode.“I wanted to have gender balance because we teach patriarchy and gender equality as part of the course,” says Devitt. The podcast can also be used by students who considering taking the subject.“If students are unsure about a new subject and they listen in to a podcast it maybe helps them make an informed decision about whether they want to do it or not,” says Devitt, “ It gives them a little snippet of it ideas it will deal with.”PIY-Podcast it YourselfElaine Smith, freelance broadcast journalist, teaches a course on podcasting for teachers and has some advice for those interested in making their own podcast to help fellow teachers or students access content without adding to screen time during the remote learning experience.“Podcasts can be introduced to the classroom in a number of ways,” says Smith. Teachers who have already completed a course can publish their own podcast. “Teachers could create episodes with content on the crucial parts of exams or even provide a podcast with key notes on particular modules,” says Smith.She says that podcasts can be the change that gives the students the break. “It’s a quick an easy way for kids to access educational content and is a break from the books. Maybe a popular podcaster has a guest or has an episode which relates to a topic in class, this may encourage pupils to learn from a different source,” says Smith.Teachers who are familiar with skills involved in creating and publishing podcasts can teach the techniques to their students. “As a result, they are learning how to create content based on their classwork,” says Smith."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

It is understood that both Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar will discuss on Tuesday how to approach other parties and groups with the document. Between them the two parties have 72 Dáil seats, eight short of a majority, and both have said they want a third, smaller party and some Independents in a coalition government. The framework document is said to be light on specific policy measures but it is rather intended to be “designed to be inviting” for other parties such as the Social Democrats, the Greens and Labour. Thus far the Social Democrats have said their policies would be incompatible with a Fine Gael-Flanna Fáil government. Labour has said it wants to go into opposition, and the Greens are calling for a national unity government. Social contractThe framework document is built around a number of “missions”, and seeks to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, rebuild the economy in its wake and tackle issues that featured in the general election such as health and housing. It will also seek to build a new “social contract”.Other measures included in the document to appeal to those parties include the prospect of a national living wage, although an exact level is not defined. It also mentions reducing the State’s carbon emissions, but a precise target is not mentioned. Other measures in the document are said to include a commitment to build upon the extra resources allocated to the health sector during the Covid-19 crisis. Well-placed sources said the document envisages using economic growth to tackle a deficit caused by extra spending to deal with Covid-19 rather than austerity measures seen during the financial crash. Continuing support of the European Central Bank was cited by sources in helping Ireland through the post-crisis period, although it is not clear if this is included in the documentAmong the proposals said to be included are grants for businesses hit by the pandemic. Housing policy is understood to have seen a significant change in emphasis, compared to the previous Fine GaelIndependent minority government approach.Affordable housingThe Land Development Agency will be give a greater role to deliver social and affordable housing, as well as affordable rental houses. The pledge not to increase income taxes was said to be key for Fine Gael, but does not rule out other tax changes, such as the removal of some tax incentives.Minister for Health Simon Harris on Monday said a majority government was needed to deal with the “massive challenges” ahead. “We need other political parties to join us.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227707.1586773432!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the science the case for crushing covid 19 rather than living with it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  in the US, said people should not assume a change in the weather will limit the spread of the coronavirus. ‘You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing,’ he said. Photograph: Al DragoThe New York Times.The need to crush it:The longer the pandemic maintains its grip, the more disagreement emerges on the best way to deal with it. Within the world of science, perhaps the most significant ergence is between the “flatten the curvists” and “Covid-19 crushers”. The latter group advocates short, sharp additional restrictions.There are two critical aspects to this. Firstly, any seasonal benefit – such as warm weather and high humidity (great for killing off flu) – may be cancelled by humanity’s vulnerability to the virus.“One should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather. You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing,” declared Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, on ABC’s Good Morning America. Fauci is the man who causes Donald Trump’s teeth to grind whenever he gives his latest update.The second difficulty is the “flatten the curve goes on for years” in the absence of a vaccine. That is why we need to weigh up balances, especially in the context of beginning to ease restrictions.A key assumption of the flatten strategy is that around the same number of people will eventually be infected with Covid-19, but just over a longer time period. Many models predict this period, which could require intermittent lockdowns, might last for up to two years.Dr Harvey Fineberg, past president of the US National Academy of Medicine, is in no doubt a different path is needed.“The aim is not to flatten the curve. The goal is to crush the curve,” he wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.New Zealand is held up as the best pupil in the class. It has had just 1,049 confirmed cases and four deaths since February 28th. Just 14 people were in hospital with the virus as of Saturday, April 11th.RCSI infectious disease specialist Prof Sam McConkey has summarised in a tweet what that might entail, and interestingly noted it would have to be on all-Ireland basis if we were go that route:“In Ireland, should we follow New Zealand, eliminate SARSCoV2 from the island through 60 days of contact-tracing and self-isolating in \u0026lt3h, use GPS location data, 14-day quarantine for travellers, cloth reusable masks for all, phone app to show status, phased openings, all with NI.”Ireland v. UK:A big question is why the pandemic has played out in the State in a discernibly different way to the UK, and to some extent Northern Ireland.Yes, we moved quicker to physical distancing and restricting movement, while it’s almost as if there was a strange, three-week delay in hard but necessary messaging across the water, trying to catch up on the lack of urgency and clarity early on. But there is more to it than that.Researcher Lainey Doyle, who specialised in the history of medicine, made telling comparisons on twitter. It started out with health systems roughly on a par for instance the UK had 6.6 ICU beds per 100,000 people the Irish equivalent was 6.5.Then deviation becomes more evident. Ireland has performed 8.69 tests per 1,000 population the UK equivalent is four.Currently, UK death rates are more than double those in Ireland 14.8 deaths per 100,000 people compared to 6.5 here (More than 10,000 deaths in the UK compared to 334 deaths as of Sunday in the State).The UK hit 1,000 deaths in a single day, coinciding with 2,000 deaths a day in the US. Remarkably, it is accounting for 10 per cent of global deaths from Covid-19, while the US daily death record is in a country with five times the population of Britain.Global race update:The race against the common enemy continues with unprecedented intensity on three fronts: to produce a vaccine to generate antiviral treatments and to engineer a validated antibody test kit to show if a person has had Covid-19.A team in Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert is confident a vaccine against coronavirus could be ready by September with human trials due to begin in the next fortnight. It seems to have stolen a march on CureVac in Germany. who flagged trials would be ready to start in JuneJuly.Pfizer and BioNTech are laying plans for manufacturing their candidates for trials by late April. BioNTech and CureVac are reported to be hard at work trying to get regulators to rewrite the rules on human trials.Meanwhile, the first results from Gilead’s late-stage testing of remdesivir (normally used to treat Ebola) are expected this month. If results are positive, expect regulatory approvals to come quickly – again raising ethical issues around fast-tracking. It’s quite possible the drug could become the standard of care for Covid-19 at least for a while.The necessary urgency at a time of pandemic is tempered by those scientists who say “not so fast”, given in “normal times” proving a vaccine works safely can be painfully slow.But as the scale of the pandemic becomes clearer, a provocative, ethically complicated proposal to shave months off that timeline is gaining traction, which advocates giving people an experimental vaccine and then deliberately try to infect them.Rubella vaccine inventor Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania told Science magazine a carefully-designed “human challenge” trial could offer clear proof of a vaccine’s worth at blinding speed.“We’re talking two, three months,” said Plotkin, who has co-authored a proposal which describes how this might be ethically done (his took six years, by the way).But “people who are faced with a terrifying problem like this one will opt for measures that are unusual. And we have to constantly rethink our biases,” he added.The problem is Covid-19 is so new. It’s not clear how often the virus makes people seriously ill or leaves them with long-term complications. Where you’re going to give somebody a virus on purpose, you really want to understand the disease so that you know that what you’re doing is a reasonable risk.Grounds for optimism:– R0 moves in right direction: Much hinges on the R0 value of an infectious disease. If it’s three, a typical person who is infected will spread it to three people during the period they’re infectious. Ireland has brought its Covid-19 R0 down from six in early March to close to one – in the US, it’s currently at six. If we get it below one, the pandemic will begin to fizzle out. The national effort has shifted to the next task at hand bringing the R0 as close as possible to zero.– Wins that matter: Let it be known April 9th was the day we reached a big milestone. It was best encapsulated by Prof Liam Glynn of UL in a tweet:“We are no longer on an exponential growth curve and this have prevented many #Covid-19 cases and deaths...Comparing our rates to some other countries our early actions saved lives...”But he did not allow room for complacency, adding: “We need to do more.”– Irish optimism ratings: Pragmatic optimism is needed as people face into weeks more of lock in amid much uncertainty over what Ireland will emerge once restrictions are eased. More than 60 per cent of adults were optimistic in the most recent analysis by Core Research. This positive level of optimism “is being influenced by the solidarity of actions from all stakeholders in society”, it concludes. Another action that delivers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228064.1586810885!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emmanuel macron extends france s lockdown until may 11th","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron addresses the nation about coronavirus on Monday night.  Photograph: Charles PlatiauReutersFrance will not begin to lift its lockdown against the Covid-19 pandemic until May 11th, President Emmanuel Macron announced on Monday night.“The epidemic is not yet under control,” Mr Macron said. “We will have to live with the virus for several more months.”France has reported 132,591 cases of Covid-19. About 14,400 French people have died from the disease.Crèches, primary and secondary schools will begin reopening on May 11th, Mr Macron said. University courses will not resume before summer. No summer festivals may be held before mid-July, at the earliest. All places of public gathering will remain closed until further notice.French borders will remain closed for the indefinite future.The French president said that from May 11th, all people who show symptoms of Covid-19 will be tested. The announcement fell short of a general testing programme which some experts say is necessary to identify carriers of the virus who show no symptoms.From May 11th, members of the public should be able to obtain surgical masks, which may become mandatory is some places, such as public transport.Mr Macron continued to compare the epidemic to a war, as he has in earlier speeches. He again thanked medical personnel “in the front line”. The beginning of his speech was postponed for several minutes while French people applauded healthcare workers from their windows, as they do every evening.Mr Macron praised the people who are enabling France to live under lockdown, including farmers, lorry drivers, deliverymen, cashiers and rubbish collectors. “Our country is holding together thanks to men and women who receive too little pay or recognition,” he said.CriticismMr Macron addressed the severe criticism that has been levelled at his administration. “Were we prepared enough for this crisis?” he asked. “Obviously not. But we faced up to it. In France, as everywhere else, we had to act urgently, take difficult decisions based on incomplete and often changing information, adapt constantly. This virus was unknown and still today holds many mysteries.”Like other countries, Mr Macron continued, France lacked surgical smocks, latex gloves and disinfectant gel. “We were not able to distribute as many masks as we wanted to healthcare workers,” he admitted. “I fully understand that when you’re on the frontline it is hard to understand that a worldwide shortage is preventing deliveries.”Within three weeks, France will quintuple its production of surgical masks, and manufacture 10,000 ventilators, Mr Macron promised. Failings will be addressed “in due course”, he added.The French president also wanted successes to be recognised, including doubling the number of beds in intensive care units, “unprecedented co-operation” between public and private hospitals and the transfer of patients to less affected regions and neighbouring countries.“But nothing is definitively won,” Mr Macron admitted. In eastern France and the Paris region, “hospital services are saturated. The epidemic is not under control. We must continue our efforts and apply the rules. The more they are respected, the more lives we will save.”Prolonging the lockdown until May 11th was “essential to slow the propagation of the virus even more, to have enough ICU beds and to enable healthcare workers to regain their strength”.Even then, Mr Macron warned “May 11th will only be possible if we continue to show civic sense and responsibility”.Mr Macron said he would ask hospitals and nursing homes to make it possible for those who are dying to see loved ones a last time.Government fundsMore than eight million French workers are receiving government funds under measures put in place to ease effects of the epidemic. Mr Macron said he will ask this week’s cabinet meeting to increase assistance further.Some Asian countries lifted lockdowns to find that “the virus which they thought they had conquered returned, and they had to shut down their economies again”, Mr Macron said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227928.1586794403!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"favelas feel brunt of coronavirus restrictions in brazil","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVolunteers members of Associacao Acao Comunitaria Nova Heliopolis distribute food in Heliopolis favela  during the coronavirus pandemic in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Photograph:  Rodrigo PaivaGetty “Despite recessions people still get married, have new babies and celebrate birthdays. But with coronavirus every event I had booked has been cancelled. Even weddings are being postponed,” she says.With her income suddenly gone, Leal has been forced to spend the money she had saved up for a new camera to buy food during the three weeks she has spent observing the state government’s call for people to stay at home.But many workers in the southern hemisphere’s biggest city have no such financial resources to draw on. “More and more people who survived in the informal economy but have no savings are having to seek help with getting food as their incomes have been suddenly cut off by the pandemic,” says André Silva of the Movement in Defence of Favela Residents, an organisation helping co-ordinate emergency relief to residents in 35 shantytowns in the vast eastern zone of São Paulo.Like in much of the rest of the world, attempts in Brazil to contain the spread of coronavirus have led to a sharp economic contraction, which has hit an estimated 40 million workers in the informal sector particularly hard.Fearful of the impact on his presidency, far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro has stoked fears about the social fallout from this sudden downturn as part of his campaign against quarantine measures imposed by state governors.QuarantineSo far there have only been a few isolated reports of minor looting.But the social pain caused by the plunge in economic activity is at least partially responsible for a recent weakening in adherence to efforts to contain the spread of the virus. “People want to isolate but they need help to do so or they will go back out to try to earn some money,” says Silva.In the last week large urban centres across the country registered a marked uptick in activity compared to when quarantine measures were first imposed last month. Health authorities warn this will compromise efforts at containment when the number of infections and deaths from Covid-19 continue to rise in Brazil.The deterioration prompted João Doria, the governor of São Paulo state where most Covid-19 cases are concentrated, to warn that if over Easter people did not co-operate with pleas to stay at home then his administration would start adopting more rigorous measures including prison for those breaking the quarantine effort that officials hope will allow for a controlled return to work.In a move that could aid this effort, Bolsonaro’s economics team, which initially appeared paralysed in the face of the crisis, has now moved to try to mitigate the worst of the pandemic’s social impact.At the heart of the response is a programme to pay 600 reais (€107) a month for three months to informal workers and double that for mothers supporting a family.Within 24 hours of the programme launching 22 million people signed up with a state bank to receive the payment. Among those who applied was photographer Janice Leal. “My savings are running out already but my application is ‘under review’. So we’ll see. Until it is approved I won’t count on it,” she says.BureaucraticThe first payments were due to be made over the Easter holiday period.But some observers are concerned about the capacity of the state machine to respond quickly enough given the speed at which the pandemic has wreaked havoc on the economy.“You have two timescales. The urgent one of hunger. And the timescale of the public sector which is slow and bureaucratic. So far the situation has been under control. But we have little time to keep it this way,” says former minister Raul Jungmann.A former minister of public security, Jungmann warns any delay in distributing the emergency resources means Brazil’s large metropolitan areas, where the country’s gaping social inequalities are most apparent, run the risk of suffering some sort of “commotion” that could undermine the containment efforts that still have the backing of a majority of Brazilians.“Time is of the essence,” he warns. “The state has to reach these people and put money in their hands. If not people will have to chose between the hypothesis of being contaminated or the certainty of hunger. And the certainty of hunger is much more concrete.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228087.1586817458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"saliva test may help diagnose coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA doctor wearing personal protective equipment holds a saliva swab in a test tube during coronavirus symptom tests in an outpatient clinic in Zwickau, Germany. File photograph: Krisztian BocsiBloombergUS university researchers have received US government clearance for the first saliva test to help diagnose Covid-19, a new approach that could help expand testing options and reduce risks of infection for health care workers.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the test under its emergency powers to quickly clear new tests and therapies to fight the outbreak, Rutgers University in New Jersey said.The test initially will be available through hospitals and clinics affiliated with the school.The announcement comes as communities across the US continue to struggle with testing to help track and contain the coronavirus.The current approach to screening for Covid-19 requires healthcare workers to take a swab from a patient’s nose or throat.To lessen infection risks, many hospitals and clinics instruct staff to discard gloves and masks after close contact with anyone who may have the virus. And many institutions are struggling with shortages of basic medical supplies, including gloves, masks and swabs.With the new saliva-based test, patients are given a plastic tube into which they spit several times. They then hand the tube back to the healthcare worker for laboratory processing.“This prevents health care professionals from having to actually be in the face of somebody that is symptomatic,” said Andrew Brooks, who directs the Rutgers lab that developed the test.An infectious disease expert not involved with the new test said it would help overcome some of the patient discomfort and difficulties in taking swab samples.“You want to be in all types of situations with all types of options so that we can have as much testing as possible in whatever form is suitable,” said Dr Amesh Adalja of Johns Hopkins University.Dr Adalja noted that similar saliva tests have helped expand testing for HIV and other conditions.Rutgers tested the accuracy of its method by taking both saliva and swab samples from 60 patients.

But I actually wondered for a couple of weeks whether I should write it at all – #allinthistogether and all that jazz.Luckily, the copious whining and ill-will from Wokers at a time when the Conservative government is acting like Robin Hood has given me renewed purpose.When most people are in denial, they’re in denial about Bad Things – as a coping mechanism – but the Woke are the only group who are permanently in denial about Good Things, such as the generosity of the government, for kicks. It must drive them nuts that we’re finally moving towards a sort of socialism – not a performative brag – in which ordinary people become everyday heroes. The Woke in this crisis remind me of those dogs you see in pubs sometimes, who aren’t really angry, but utter one bark every ten minutes just to keep their equipment running.The preferred leisure activity of the Woke is, of course, virtue-signalling – and don’t they have a brand new box of toys to chuck out of their prams now! Putting on a mask and gloves just to go out for a pint of almond milk they get to feel like bold frontline fighters, looking askance at those of us with the temerity to expose our noses and knuckles.Hearing of hoi polloi relaxing in public spaces they can tut smugly as they tend their herb gardens. On social media they can advocate for avocados as a sure way to wellness with the implication that if one is sensible enough to eat clean nothing so common as the coronavirus would dare invade one’s immaculate innards.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedThe plague has highlighted the gap between many groups – those who do useful work are more likely to get it than the useless, ethnic minorities are more likely than white people, men than women, smokers than non-smokers. But I’d imagine that it will be spread equally between Modernists (my tribe) and Nostalgics – Hopers vs Mopers, as I think of them. We Hopers can’t wait to rush out and thrown our arms around our one and only world in all its corrupt glory once more the Mopers having got what they wanted – no cheap foreign travel, Mother Nature silencing the city – and are keen to stress that when we get out the other side we must not re-prioritise frivolous things over the simple life.That’s what they say, of course – what they do is entirely different. I wouldn’t despise virtue-signalling so much if it was just a prelude to actual virtue, but I’ve come to believe from extended observation that many practitioners simply use it as a smokescreen that enables them to be even more selfish than the rest of us. The “Woke Cloak” as it’s been called, which led to the amusing spectacle last year of the Extinction Rebellion spokesman who flounced out of an interview after it was pointed out to him that the many skiing trips he had posted on social media were hardly the “emergencies” that he wanted flying to be confined to.So in this time of contemplation, I’d like to speak up for foreign travel, incessant socialising and crazed pleasure-seeking. But for all you Nostalgics who’ve suddenly had the revelation that you wanted to live like an Amish all along, please do stick to your plan of staycations and home-cooking because, to be honest, you don’t bring a great deal in the way of wit and wisdom to the table and I think we’ll just about struggle along without you.And everyone who’s ever spoken or typed the words Big Pharma will hopefully go to the back of the queue when a vaccine is discovered (probably by the Israelis – none for you, boycotters!), stick to their crystals and leave the nasty newfangled vaccines to we shameless embracers of the modern world. And please, have the sensitivity to understand that for the millions of your fellow citizens whose lives were pretty damn simple already – eat, work, sleep, worry about money, repeat – what lies ahead is not a pastoral Walden Pond dream, but a living nightmare.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

A total of 98 of the new infections were imported, and 49 were Chinese nationals who tested positive after coming home from Russia. Although the number of daily infections across China have dropped sharply since the peak of the domestic epidemic in February, the toll has been creeping steadily higher because of arrivals from abroad. A similar phenomenon has been seen in South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which all successfully beat back the virus earlier this year only to see a rise in cases as the virus swept the globe and their citizens flocked home. Chinese cities near the border with Russia are now tightening border controls and imposing stricter quarantines.Heilongjiang’s capital, Harbin, now requires all arrivals to quarantine for 28 days and undergo nucleic and antibody tests for the virus. Residential units in Harbin, where people have been confirmed to have the virus, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, are to be locked down for 14 days.The city of Suifenhe, which was one of the few open border crossings after Russia stopped all flights and  incoming road traffic in late January and early February, last week announced restrictions on movements and gatherings similar to those imposed in Wuhan, the original epicentre of the virus.Provinces bordering Southeast Asia are on high alert while Inner Mongolia has converted facilities for virus treatment at Manzhouli, its biggest land border checkpoint. Hubei, the hard-hit eastern province surrounding Wuhan, appears now to be recovering and on Monday reported no new Covid-19 cases. Beijing, the Chinese capital, has announced that schools closed by the coronavirus outbreak will start a phased reopening by the end of April.Senior high school students will return to campus on April 27, and senior students at middle schools will return by May 11, reported CCTV.All pupils returning to Beijing must complete 14 days of quarantine before re-entering the classroom.  China has officially reported 82,160 coronavirus cases and 3,341 deaths, although there has been widespread doubt about the accuracy of the figures. In what appears to be the latest attempt to control the narrative of the coronavirus, China has now imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research about the origins of Covid-19. According to a CNN report, a central government directive and online notices published by two Chinese universities, which have since been removed, indicated that all academic papers on Covid-19 will be subject to extra vetting before being submitted for publication. Studies on the origin of the virus will receive extra scrutiny and must be approved by central government officials, according to the now-deleted posts.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government thought imposing lockdown would difficult convincing","story":"Having found the right message to convince the public of the need to stay indoors, the Government is now in danger of becoming a victim of its own success, in public information terms at least. The coronavirus lockdown will, one day, come to an end, but on the current evidence, persuading people that it is safe to go back to their normal lives will be a challenge.A YouGov poll published on Monday showed huge support for the stringent social distancing measures imposed by Boris Johnson, with little appetite for an immediate lifting of curbs that had seemed inconceivable only a few weeks ago.Ministers have been taken aback by just how obedient the public has been. Businesses that could have remained open throughout the crisis - like Greggs and McDonald\u0027s - were forced to shut down under pressure from customers, and estimates of 20 per cent of children attending school proved to be way out. The actual figure has been below two per cent.The knock-on effect of all this has been devastating for the economy, with Government loans and bailouts costing billions more each week than predicted. Unemployment has soared.With deaths falling for a third day in a row on Monday - albeit over a bank holiday weekend which could have affected reporting - thoughts in Whitehall are now turning to how and when to get the country moving again.Whether we are a week, a month, or even further away from that moment, there will come a point when Britain will be told to start going back to work, school, and even the pub.The problem for the Government is that simply telling the public what they should do will not be enough. They must first be convinced that what they are being told is the right thing to do, and that the Government is not simply putting the economy before saving lives.Ministers have been asked to come up with evidence to show how many lives could ultimately be lost, rather than saved, by the lockdown, through missed cancer diagnoses, long-term poverty and an underfunded NHS.“There’s no point announcing something before the public is ready for it,” one minister said on Monday. “If you look at what happened when we went into lockdown, we took the public with us because they realised the time had come when it needed to be done. If we had done it a week earlier people would have ignored it and a week later people would have said we reacted too late. It has to be the same when we come out of this.”Hence a lot of thought is now going into just how the lifting of the lockdown is eventually presented.Talk of an “exit strategy” has been dropped, because the word “exit” implies an abrupt end to the lockdown which the public finds worrying. Instead we can expect to hear more and more talk of “emerging” from the lockdown and “unwinding” the measures as part of a more gradual process.As long as the NHS retains the capacity to deal with all coronavirus patients, as it has done so far (in contrast to Italy, where hospitals were overrun), and as long as deaths continue to fall, ministers will be able to make the argument for a return to work.As one Government source put it, “only then will we know how many people have been social distancing because they have been told to, and how many are doing it because they are scared”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"half people unable work home coronavirus lockdown figures suggest","story":"Up to half of people are unable to work from home during coronavirus lockdown, figures suggest amid fears for the economic impact of social distancing measures.Those in high income jobs and living in London and the south east are most likely to have been able to adapt, analysis shows as the number of businesses needing Government support to pay staff is much higher than expected.Many parents working from home are now also struggling to juggle childcare with researchers warning that the “economic harms of school closures are high”.It comes amid a Cabinet split on the lockdown, with 10 members reportedly urging conditions to be eased because of concerns about the impact on the economy.Rates of compliance with social distancing measures have been higher than the scientific modelling predicted.The Government says that people should continue to go to work only where they cannot work from home, but there have been some reports of employers asking staff to continue attending the office.Data from the British Chambers of Commerce’s (BCC) weekly tracker poll, seen by the , shows that “54 percent of businesses are using remote working to maintain business continuity”.At the same time an increasing number of companies are opting to furlough their employees, with 37 percent telling the BCC they plan to furlough between 75 to 100 percent of their workforce over the coming week.The Treasury originally suggested that only 10 percent of employers would take up the coronavirus job retention scheme at a cost of around £10 billion.Dr Adam Marshall, BCC Director General, said: “We’ve seen a big jump in the number of firms furloughing staff, and many are now starting to apply for access to government loan and grant schemes to keep themselves afloat. Our research suggests that support is only starting to reach firms on the ground.”Business groups including the CBI are said to have written to the Treasury this weekend asking them to extend the scheme past three months to prevent firms having to lay off staff.It comes as companies struggle to adapt to new ways of working, with a number of smaller firms warning that they do not have the technical capabilities to allow their entire workforce to log in remotely.Figures released by the Office for National Statistics after the lockdown was announced showed that before the pandemic struck there were 32.6million in employment and around 1.7million of those regularly worked from home.Less than 30 percent of the workforce had ever worked from home, according to the annual population survey, with those in higher paid jobs living in London and the south east most able to avoid the office.A survey by YouGov found that 52 percent of people across the UK do not usually work from home and this has not changed despite lockdown measures instructing them to do so. This was lower in the capital, at 37 percent, and highest in Scotland at 59 percent followed by the Midlands and Wales at 56 percent.A daily tracker launched by the polling company, which is providing data to the Government’s scientific team, shows that around 40 percent of people have never worked from home and this has not changed during lockdown.Around a quarter of respondents said that they had changed their workplace and were now working solely from home.The findings have been echoed in a study by the Resolution Foundation, which found that the lowest paid jobs in sectors such as health, retail and tourism – which account for 42 per cent of the workforce -  were “extremely unlikely to be able to work from home”.The authors said: “Less than one-in-ten of those in the bottom half of earners say they can work from home, making it much harder for them to protect their incomes in the face of social distancing measures.”A UCL study, published in the Lancet, has also warned that school closures cause “economic harms to working parents, health-care workers, and other key workers being forced from work to childcare, and to society due to loss of parental productivity”.Research has found that around 16 percent of the workforce are the primary caregivers, rising to 30 percent in health and social care sectors.A three month school closure could wipe up to 1 percent of the UK’s national gross domestic product (GDP) per year, mainly through absenteeism of parents, the authors warned.A growing number of bosses are now concerned about their workers juggling home working and childcare, according to a survey of HR professionals.According to research by People Management magazine and The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 65 percent of employers were worried about their staff’s ability to juggle the two commitments.Just over half said that they were encouraging parents to make up their hours at different times to normal in order to be able to cope.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/13/12/bocelli.jpg","title":"andrea bocelli easter coronavirus milan concert duomo cathedral kim kardashian","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Kim Kardashian, Hugh Jackman and Kaley Cuoco are among the stars who have praised opera singer Andrea Bocelli’s moving Easter Sunday concert.The Italian tenor performed a show at\u0026nbspthe deserted Duomo cathedral in Milan on Sunday night (12 April).

Just a couple of days later came a blast and the words that would shock and fascinate the world:\u0026nbspOK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here.Nasa is marking the anniversary of the mission it refers to as a successful failure, which represents one of its most high-profile disasters and its most famous miracles. It is a part of space history that is celebrated even today, with the story of the mission continuing to captivate the world.It was 11 April\u0026nbspthat marked the day the astronauts blasted off on their way to the Moon, and 13 April that an oxygen tank explosion started the mission to save the astronauts from being stuck in space.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn 17 April, nearly exactly six days after the mission began, the astronauts fell back through the Earth\u0027s atmsosphere and arrived safely back on Earth. It was an unlikely end to an unlucky mission.While it is now remembered as one of the most important moments in Nasa\u0027s history, the mission began in relative obscurity for a trip to the Moon. Apollo 11 had already managed to get to the lunar surface, and so what just a couple of years before was regarded as a near-impossibility was by that time relatively unexciting.Astronauts on screen from The Right Stuff to Apollo 13 and GravityBut hours later, television stations around the world were giving rolling updates on the mission\u0027s status, following closely as the astronauts and Nasa engineers back on Earth tried to save them from disaster.As well as being a relatively unwatched mission, the first couple of days of the journey were almost tediously straightforward. After two days of flight, one of the Nasa staff in mission control joked the astronauts that the spacecraft was in such good shape that they were bored to tears.Problems began on Apollo 13 when the astronauts were nearing the Moon and heard a bang and felt a shudder through their spacecraft. During what should have been a routine stir, one of the oxygen tanks on the spacecraft had burst and exploded.(After the mission was over, the explosion was traced back to overheating while the spacecraft was being tested on the ground, but there was no way to know that at the time.)The explosion also knocked out the fuel cells that should have been powering the spacecraft, and sent voltage in its circuits plunging. Engineers watching the mission from Mission Control saw the pressure in the damaged oxygen tank drop instantly.OK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here, said\u0026nbspJack\u0026nbspSwigert, the command module pilot who had actually joined the mission as a last-minute substitute for a colleague who had become sick just before the mission took off.Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem, said Jim Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13.Almost immediately, it became clear that the astronauts would not be landing on the Moon, as planned. But that was a relatively unimportant challenge compared with the more pressing job of staying alive.In many ways, the explosion happened at the best possible time, and the astronauts would later say they considered themselves lucky. If it had happened earlier, they would have run out of power later, and the blast could have happened in lunar orbit or on the surface of the Moon.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It would require them to slingshot around the Moon – coming frustratingly close to the surface they were supposed to land on – and then whip back around and float back home to Earth.In the meantime, mission control got to work putting together a rescue plan while the astronauts on board attempted to put out of their mind just how likely it was they would now die in space, something they say they never discussed.Flight controllers told the astronauts to shut down their command module and climb into Aquarius. That module was supposed to be the box that took the astronauts down to the lunar surface – but was refashioned into a lifeboat in an attempt to conserve power.Because it was never meant for so many people for so long, the lander was low on space. It was also filled with carbon dioxide, as the astronauts breathed inside their new, tiny spacecraft.One of the most famous breakthroughs came as engineers tried to find a way to fix that problem, by using the air purifiers from the now abandoned capsule in the lander. The two were the wrong shape to fit together – they were literally trying to fit a square canister into a round hole – but engineers back on Earth came up with a way of using various pieces of spacecraft to push the two together.Even once that was fixed, conditions inside the lander were miserable, without the energy for heating or other improvements to their conditions. They were stuck inside of a frigid box that was never meant to hold them, stuck\u0026nbspfor days with little to do but wait and see if the various last-minute solutions to their desperate situation would actually work.(The astronauts have said they didn\u0027t argue during this time, despite the miserable conditions, and didn\u0027t talk about the possibility of getting stuck floating in space and waiting to die either Lovell wrote in his autobiography that they were too busy struggling for survival. He also denied that they had poison pills hidden away in case of becoming lost.)Eventually they arrived back near home for what is traditionally one of the most perilous parts of the journey: dropping back through Earth\u0027s atmosphere to come home. They had enough power to switch on the command module and wait as they went through the gruelling, hot ordeal of slamming back down to Earth.As they did, the communications blackout that comes from the extreme conditions of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere lingered for much longer than usual, leaving flight controllers in the dark as to whether the three astronauts and their hacked-together spacecraft had survived.But eventually they appeared in the air, the spacecraft being cradled by three parachutes as it fell through the sky and down to Earth. They were picked up and all three completed a journey whose legacy – one of inventiveness and luck that became mission control\u0027s greatest achievement – is still celebrated by Nasa today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But after the breakdown in relations with Russia in early March, it jacked up production to 11 million barrels a day.So some of those headline cuts merely offset the supply glut from the recent price war. There’s a formidable amount of black stuff in storage in ships and containers around the planet to get through.And then there’s the demand element of the equation to consider.The unprecedented lockdowns ordered by governments in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has seen global demand for energy plummet by around 30 per cent.Opec itself expected global oil demand to fall by 20 million barrels a day in April.That puts the 10 million barrels a day production cuts in the right context.As Bjornar Tonhaugen of Rystad\u0026nbspEnergy\u0026nbspputs it,\u0026nbspOpec has “only come up with half of the ransom money”.You can’t buck the market, as someone once said.Energy analysts are also doubtful about whether the production cuts will actually be delivered.Opec is not the cohesive force that it once was. The cartel has suffered from indiscipline internally. Can countries such as Iraq and Nigeria be relied on not to break ranks as their exchequers come under massive pressure in the coming months? And Opec allies are not necessarily reliable either, as the fiasco with Russia clearly demonstrates.“Trust, but verify” was the cautious view of the US towards Soviet nuclear disarmament pledges during the Cold War. Markets seem to be taking a similar attitude to production cuts now.And yet it’s possible to see something new emerging from the chaos of this price war, in particular the pressure successfully applied by Donald Trump to his Saudi allies and also Vladimir Putin’s Russia.The endorsement of the planned Opec cuts by G20 energy ministers last week and also the International Energy Agency, which was founded by industrialised countries in the 1970s to protect their fuel supplies, could also be significant.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe word is that large oil consumer nations including the US, India, China and Japan are preparing to boost their oil reserves in order to help support the global oil price – and non-Opec western states Norway and Canada have signalled a willingness to cut their own oil production volumes.Economists had expected the collapse in oil prices to exert deflationary pressure on the world economy. A deal to curb supply reduces some of that danger.These are early days, of course. But international coordination on oil production could be a significant legacy of this crisis. It’s far too early to talk about global recovery when we are still on the terrifying downward slope, but more a more stable energy market could help underpin it when it eventually arrives.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That’s all I would say, as someone with an enquiring mind.”Versions of the 5G conspiracy theory have been spreading online for years, with some proponents claiming the coronavirus outbreak is just the latest in a string of pandemics induced by\u0026nbspelectromagnetic waves.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)The theory has been disproved countless times by scientists, with one microbiology professor recently describing it as\u0026nbsp”both a physical and biological impossibility”.That has not stopped the baseless claims being shared by high-profile figures such as actor Woody Harrelson and TV presenter Amanda Holden.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we’re doing everything we can to get that increased volume out where it’s needed.”The meal-kit company HelloFresh provides a regular supply of its surplus fruit and vegetables to the charity – and donated £25,000 to help the charity scale up its operations.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The pandemic has hit at cruel time for businesses who rely on themFor the first time in 800 years, the cathedral in Britain’s tiniest city will be empty this Easter Sunday.Several thousand visitors would have been expected to pour into St Davids Cathedral this weekend. Instead, the bishop of St Davids has invited them to pause at 10.30am on Sunday as she presides at the Easter Eucharist – from her kitchen.Because of coronavirus, several dozen of the small businesses in this seaside city in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, will also be losing out on visitors.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEaster, and the warmer weather it tends to bring, signals the awakening of the tourist season for hotspots across Britain.St Davids starts to see long lines form at beachside ice cream vans. Surfers hit the breaks on Whitesands Bay, tourists rent kayaks and coasteering guides, and\u0026nbspthen fill up on pasties called oggies before heading back to caravans and campsites.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastInstead, businesses have either sent staff home on furlough, reinvented themselves… or packed up.St Davids Cross Hotel, which has 16 rooms costing up to £145 a night, had been fully booked this weekend and most of next week. More than 100 guests have cancelled.“With the weather we’ve got down in Pembrokeshire at the moment, it’s been absolutely glorious for the last week and it’s going to be very nice next week,” says Alex Perkins, the hotel’s manager. “I suppose now we just hope that we’ll make it up in the summer or the winter.”Initially, the three-star hotel tried to adapt to the pandemic with takeaway food, and even put on a delivery Sunday roast service for Mother’s Day. But as time went on, the owners decided to completely shut and furlough the staff to reduce chances of transmitting the virus. “We’d rather people do stay at home than travel down to us,” Alex adds.Down the road, The Meadow cafe has made a slightly more unusual operational swerve. Co-owner Nick Michell has set up a health and fitness training service, offering one-to-one training through an app\u0026nbspand remote coaching.The 47-year-old says: “I was a personal trainer beforehand and I was intending to incorporate some of my services into what we do at the cafe, with a wellbeing offering.” Now that the cafe has closed, the fitness plans have been jolted into fruition.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would be extremely busy – Easter’s always a very busy time down here anyway because it’s the first of the big holidays after winter.”The farmhouse-style\u0026nbspcafe will benefit from the business rate relief, and the owners will take up the government’s offer to pay 80 per cent of the salary for the 10 furloughed staff. In the summer, another 10 workers are usually hired – a marker of the boom of the local economy in the tourist season. But the virus could wipe\u0026nbspout work for locals. St Davids has a population of around 1,600 but the city’s visitors reach into the hundreds of thousands throughout the year.As for business loans that are being made available by the Welsh government, Nick, who has an 18-month-old daughter, is not keen. “Loans are loans and you’ve got to pay them back,” he says. “With any new business, you invest significantly at the start. So we have already invested quite a lot anyway. We’re reluctant to refinance, to continue reinvesting with the unknown that is the future.”Unknown really is the word – the three-week lockdown marker is about to arrive, with no sign of an end yet in sight. And if we’re slowly eased out of paralysis, cafes, hotels and restaurants fear\u0026nbspmeasures will still restrict customers.The pandemic has hit at a cruel time. “We rely on from now until September to get probably 75 per cent of our income for the year,” Nick adds. His wife Emma, a yoga instructor, may soon be joining him in setting up remote classes.Back at the cathedral, Dean Sarah Rowland Jones still has high spirits. “We’ve got a community WhatsApp group, there’s stuff on Facebook, there’s a lot of people ringing each other up,” she says. “People are being particularly assiduous in looking out for one another. The rest of the year, the resident community is small. So in that sense, it’s quite easy to know who’s who and to watch out for everybody.”The locals who make up the congregation are also still able to join in by watching the cathedral’s YouTube videos, she adds.And at a time of uncertainty, at least they can be fairly sure that next year’s\u0026nbspEaster Sunday service won’t\u0026nbspbe held in the bishop’s\u0026nbspkitchen.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some 1.5 million people reported not eating for a whole day during the first three weeks of\u0026nbsplockdown, according to a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll for The Food Foundation.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting\u0026nbspwork going on across the country to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak and is backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several food banks have told us they have been forced to close their doors, many of them are attempting to switch gears and move into the home delivery of emergency food packages.Bassetlaw Food Bank in Nottinghamshire was forced to “temporarily suspend” normal\u0026nbspoperations at the beginning of April, after it lost more than two-thirds of its mainly older volunteers who are having to self-isolate or follow NHS shielding guidance.How to support our campaignAdministrator Mark\u0026nbspBagguley\u0026nbspis part of a skeleton team now working with\u0026nbspBassetlaw\u0026nbspCouncil Voluntary Service (BCVS) to make sure the most vulnerable people in the area get food parcels dropped at their door.“You just have to find a different way of doing things,” he said. “We’re trying to work others as best we can. It’s very difficult to say whether the local need is being met, now that everything has been thrown on its head. You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for universal credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now coordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And there are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence.Hostility with China is not going to help solve the coronavirus crisisTory rebels are right – Huawei is a threat to our national securityJohnson suffers revolt in Tory vote to end Huawei 5G involvement“Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice.”Last month, the government hinted at future concessions to opponents of Huawei’s involvement in rolling out the ultrafast wireless technology when a minister said 36 Tory MPs who refused to vote in line with the leadership had been heard “loud and clear”.The rebels fear Huawei is effectively a front for the Chinese state – putting the UK’s security at risk – and want it ripped out of the 5G network by the end of 2022.But in his letter, Mr Zhang highlighted Huawei’s already extensive role in Britain’s data network, and said the firm was “focused on keeping Britain connected” during the “unprecedented” coronavirus pandemic.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanHe said data usage had increased by at least 50 per cent since Covid-19 first reached the UK, placing “significant pressure” on telecoms systems.“That’s why reliable mobile and broadband networks are crucial. During this pandemic our engineers – designated ‘essential’ workers – are striving around the clock to keep Britain connected.”The intervention comes amid multiple acts of vandalism and arson in recent days against telecoms gear, apparently fuelled by internet conspiracy theories linking the spread of coronavirus to 5G.The baseless theory, which scientists have branded\u0026nbsp“complete rubbish”, suggests radio waves from the technology causes changes in people’s bodies which make\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspsusceptible to the virus.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some 15 per cent of respondents from ethnic minorities said they had lost their job, compared with\u0026nbsp8 per cent of white Britons.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As an absolute priority, ministers must pick up the pace and act to reduce the inequality gap.“Liberal Democrats will be a voice for the most vulnerable at this challenging times. We are calling on the government to introduce a ‘citizen’s income’ and an end to the five-week wait for benefits by raising benefit rates, abolishing sanctions and turning day-one universal credit loans into grants.”The BMG poll exposed the extent of disruption caused by the pandemic.Overall, 31 per cent of those questioned said their household income had fallen.Of those who are facing reduced financial circumstances, a massive 20 per cent – the equivalent of 6 per cent of the population as a whole, or around 4 million people – said their household had lost half or more of its total income.Some 11 per cent of those reporting a loss said their total household income had dropped by up to 9 per cent, 23 per cent said it was down by between 10-19 per cent, 26 per cent that they had lost 20-29 per cent of their income, 7 per cent had lost 30-39 per cent and 5 per cent had lost 40-49 per cent.In a reflection of the empty supermarket shelves left by panic buying, some 50 per cent of those questioned said they had experienced difficulties sourcing food and 49 per cent obtaining other essential items during the outbreak.And family life has suffered, with 23 per cent unable to visit relatives or friends with new babies, 11 per cent missing funerals and 5 per cent cancelling or postponing wedding plans. Half of all those surveyed (50 per cent) said they had cancelled holidays because of coronavirus.BMG questioned 1,541 British adults between 7 and 9 AprilShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The sign that adorned the entrance of the market, a landmark of Wuhan city, has also been removed.As residents prepare for a return to work this week, business owners at the market will have nowhere to go. “Since all businesses need to apply for permission from the government before they restart operation, it will be impossible for these businesses to gain the government’s approval,” said Michael, who used to own a fruit stand a few blocks away from the Huanan Seafood Market and refused to give his real name.Wildlife trade was once a lucrative and thriving industry in China, but the suspicion that the current coronavirus pandemic started in\u0026nbspexotic animals smuggled into the country has forced the government to crack down on the decades-old trade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Beijing rolled out a strict ban on the breeding and consumption of wild animals, as it tried to prevent another outbreak from happening. This was a general guidance issued from the central government, with the power to enforce the law ultimately lying with provincial or municipal officials.Several other provinces have followed suit, and the southern industrial hub Shenzhen announced a ban on the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat on Thursday, becoming the first Chinese city to do so.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Wuhan, local officials have been increasingly strict in their crackdown on businesses engaged in wildlife trade or breeding. On 3 March, local authorities in Wuhan carried out a comprehensive disinfection campaign across the entire Huanan Seafood Market.However, recent reports suggest that despite the regional governments\u0027\u0026nbspefforts to put an end to wildlife trade, illicit commercial activities are still happening at public markets in certain parts of China. Earlier this week, the Mail on Sunday reported that thousands of customers flooded an indoor market in the southwestern city of Guilin in China, as living dogs and cats were crammed into cages while dead bats and scorpions were on display.Andrew Huang, a Chinese culinary expert, says one of the reasons why it’s hard for the Chinese government to completely end the consumption and trading of wildlife in China is because such behaviours have become part of decades-olds tradition in the country.“Different parts of China have their specific traditions of consuming wildlife for different purposes,” Mr Huang explains. “In the northeastern part of China, bears and deers are a big part of the local delicacies while in southwestern China, bats and pangolins are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The steady demand for such wildlife has nurtured a lucrative supply chain, including some businesses that focus on breeding specific types of wild animals.”Mr Huang thinks that the current crackdown on wildlife trade and consumption might temporarily prevent relevant practices from happening in public markets, but it will be hard to completely eliminate it from the Chinese culture.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the short term, even if wildlife sellers can’t keep selling these animals in public, they will try to find other ways to keep the businesses alive,” Mr Huang tells The Independent. “As the old saying goes, life will always find a way. Even if the government has banned wildlife trade and consumption, the tradition won’t be so easily wiped out.”‘No need to close the entire market’In Wuhan, while the plan to shut down the Huanan Seafood Market is underway, local residents have different opinions about how to handle the market where the coronavirus pandemic began.“Honestly, wildlife trade isn’t the main commercial activity at the Hunan Seafood Market, as most of the sellers still focus on selling different kinds of seafood,” says Ms Xu, who was a frequent shopper at the market until it was shut down.Since the market is right next to one of the major train stations in the city, she says, it has become the regional hub for selling fruits and seafood, as well as wildlife. Due to the large number of visitors coming from different parts of Hubei province, it also became the ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus.“I think even if the government wants to ban wildlife trade, they don’t have to shut down the entire seafood market,” Ms Xu says. “This will have a huge impact on local restaurants and businesses that have long relied on the market for their seafood supplies.”Ms Xu says that instead of forcing dozens of business owners to lose their livelihoods, the Chinese government should focus more on tackling the ongoing pandemic itself. “I wish the government could conduct more coronavirus tests on citizens, because I suspect many of them could still be asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And the bus drivers — nine already dead in London alone from Covid-. And the pharmacists filling out prescriptions in tiny, windowless shops.And the postmen, delivery drivers, papergirls — and anonymous neighbours who put notes through doors offering help for the vulnerable.And the supermarket workers who stack the shelves to keep our nation fed. And a round of applause for our Queen,  this month, who gave the speech of a letime last Sunday — and for our Prime Minister who ended up in intensive care.From the bin men to Boris, we are surrounded by heroes — but the one glaring exception has been elite football.Despite inidual acts of heroism, such as Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford raising £million for underprivileged schoolkids, football has not covered itself in glory during this national emergency.On Wednesday, Premier League captains announced they were banding together to create a fund to raise millions for the NHS.This is a big-hearted gesture but can’t hide the fact that for much of this health crisis the national game has been hopelessly out of touch with the national mood.When the Prime Minister was seriously ill, it made the skin crawl to see whining millionaire footballers resisting pay cuts from clubs that have nothing to sell, no revenue coming in and no idea when football will begin again.Gordon Taylor, the £million-a-year chief of the Professional Footballers Association, has made his members about as popular as bankers.While the country fights for its le, Taylor has fought for the rights of loafing footballers to keep every last million. He has badly misjudged the moment, as have the clubs owned by billionaires who have furloughed their tea ladies while pampered footballers continue to earn up to £, a week.It has been embarrassing to see hypocritical footballers mistaking “lockdown” for “lock-in”, acting like the new rules do not apply to them.After previously urging fans to stay at home, Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish emerged bleary-eyed from an all-night party and pranged his -grand Range Rover.Manchester City’s Kyle Walker had a couple of escort girls delivered to his door, soon before telling the peasants to social distance and save lives and blah-blah-blah. All that stuff about washing your hands, Kyle — should that be before or after the escorts have been round And Spurs manager Jose Mourinho oversaw a training session on Hadley Common, for all the world asthere was one rule for the princes of football and one for the plebs who pay their wages.Do the fatheads of football ever watch the news Mass unemployment is coming. Many of the millions about to be chucked on the dole will be football fans. So how the hell can football — the players, clubs, PFA — continue to kid themselves the bubble they exist in has not already burst The world has changed.There should be no more all-night parties, no more escort girls and no more car prangs. Like it or not, footballers are role models and many will follow their lead.Troy Deeney, Watford captain and one of the prime movers behind the Players Together fund, defends Jack Grealish’s busy social le during the time of lockdown. “What’s he going to do ” Troy asked. “Sit in the yard on his own ”Yes, Troy — because that’s what millions are doing right now. Shocking, I know, but the new rules apply to footballers, too.Most footballers come from working-class backgrounds but too many of them have a sense of entitlement worthy of Marie Antoinette.Look what happened to her.NEVER going out is placing an unbearable strain on relationships.So it is nice to see that Camila Morrone, , and Leonardo DiCaprio, , seem to be happily self-isolating together.I was afraid Leo might decide Camila’s just too old for him.STEVE HEDLEY, rail union fat cat at the RMT, boasts that he would “throw a party”Boris Johnson died of coronavirus – and hopes “the whole Cabinet of Tory b******s” also become victims.If Hedley was on a ventilator fighting for his le, would he check how the doctors and nurses caring for him voted at the last election You don’t think those NHS heroes all voted Labour, do you, Steve WILLIAM and Kate carried out their first virtual royal duty this week, thanking teaching staff who look after the children of key workers.I have never seen smiles that wide on the faces of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.I am sure that, deep down inside, they are really missing Harry and Meghan.They are just covering it up really well.FAREWELL Honor Blackman, who has died at the age of , immortal for ever in her career-defining role as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger.It is funny how certain names fall out of favour.At school I had mates called Keith and Ian, but nobody is called Keith or Ian today.Same thing with Pussy Galore. Bond girls just don’t get called things like Pussy Galore any more.THIS lockdown is taking an enormous toll on jobs, education and mental health but most of us understand it is necessary.I am infuriated, though, by the constant threats to intensy the lockdown, including closing the parks,a handful of idiots continue to flout the rules.Health Secretary Matt Hancock rages that he finds it “unbelievable that people are not staying at home” – and threatens to ban all exercise.Personally, I find it unbelievable that Hancock makes threats like some little home counties Hitler.Give credit to the MILLIONS who are doing their best during the lockdown.Don’t threaten the decent majority with a punishment beating because a selfish minority break the rules.If this Government ramps up the lockdown they will lose the British people. And something will explode.If some morons can’t stick to the rules, punish THEM – not the rest of us.KILLING EVE lost its way when the show’s creator Phoebe “Fleabag” Waller-Bridge bailed out after the first series. The second series was painfully naff.Early reports on the third series, starting tomorrow on BBC iPlayer, are not promising.But Jodie Comer as Russian assassin Villanelle will always make you want to tune in. Evenit is just for her new outfits.THIS global catastrophe started in China.When the dead are buried and we stand among our ruined economies, there MUST be some kind of reckoning.After World War Two, the Potsdam Conference decided that Germany should pay billion for what Germany had inflicted on humanity.China is now boasting that le is back to normal there, while we are burying NHS nurses like Rebecca Mack, , who worked in a children’s cancer unit. She has been hailed as a “wonderful daughter” by her heartbroken parents.Coronavirus was not an act of God. It started in China.A study by  senior Tories concludes that the UK should pursue China through international courts for £billion in coronavirus compensation.Germany paid for starting the war. Why shouldn’t China pay for coronavirus GREAT news that Boris is out of intensive care and on the way to recovery.But when he emerges from that ICU, he must give himself all the time it takes to fully recover.And then Boris has to lose weight. I saw David Cameron describe Boris as “very fit”.Sorry – a -year-old man who weighs over st is emphatically not “very fit”.He is a serious illness – a heart attack, stroke or diabetes – waiting to happen.I know from having Boris as my neighbour for years that he loves his jogging and cycling. But please slim down, Boris.Carrie and your unborn child need you. So does Dilyn the dog. So does your country.Because Boris Johnson’s great genius is for giving people HOPE.God knows we need some of that right now. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a magnicent address, from a magnicent woman.Her experience and serenity did more to calm and inspire the nation than anything  I can think of as this crisis has unfolded.Best of all, she reminded us that there will be le beyond this lockdown — that we will meet again.If we just focus on the here and now, we won’t be able to prepare for the future beyond the virus.But it’s also true that none of us can think straight when we are in the eye of the storm.That is where good leadership comes in. It helps us all to hold strong, not to go to pieces and to stick to the guidance given to us.Everyone looks to the leader to make decisions, and it’s the decisions we make that will chart our way out of the crisis.Unfortunately, after the Queen’s address to the nation came the news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital intensive care.At that point, anyone who was in any doubt this illness did not discriminate was forced to reconsider.At the time of writing, Boris was back on a regular hospital ward. But his illness has been a reminder that any of us are susceptible to Covid-.Most people are shocked he is in hospital and sympathise with his pregnant girlfriend Carrie Symonds.But of course it has raised the question: Who is really in chargehe is not  Without leadership, we all get distinctly uneasy.We all have leaders in our lives. We are all looking towards them to show us what to do and lead us through it.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome companies have stepped up to the plate and are doing good things — reassuring their staff, treating people well and doing their utmost to make sure people will be paid. Some aren’t, of course. But good bosses are taking pay cuts and doing everything they can to keep their businesses alive and look after their staff.At West Ham United we continue to pay all our full and part-time staff  per cent of their wages.My financial director, my manager and I have all taken a  per cent reduction to make sure this happens.It’s when there’s a crisis like this that we see who is made of what.Boris’s temporary stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, while talking about the PM’s hospital admission, referred to him as his boss, his colleague, but also his friend.Respect and friendship are the key words when it comes to good leadership.A good leader makes the tough decisions because they are right, but they are also governed by ethics. They want to do the right thing, for the right reasons. They are happy to make personal sacrices to ensure the majority are looked after.It is more important now, than ever, to put people before profits.After three weeks of lockdown, with no chance of a let-up, it’s all too easy to fall prey to catastrophic, even apocalyptic thinking.But we have to sht our thought process. We have to accept and understand that, at some point, this WILL be over.When things are calmer and clearer, we can ask what we can do to ensure we are still operating as the world gets back to normal — whatever the new normal is.The experience we are all living through really is like a storm, which continues to rage.There are so many unprecedented aspects to this situation and there is not one person in the world who will come out of it unchanged.So while there are so many challenging and dficult things going on, perhaps this lockdown is a chance for us all to learn more about ourselves.How are you responding  Have you thought about how you can help others  Have you thought about volunteering for the NHS As well as the importance of good leadership, we all have our inidual roles when it comes to showing autonomy and courage about our own decisions.I’m sorry to say, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.So we all need to take responsibility — or we will never get out of lockdown.ANYONE who saw the social media video of Naomi Watts reaching breaking point after her printer, vacuum cleaner and dishwasher all broke down will surely have smiled in recognition.Naomi, who has been self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three weeks, shared her very understandable anguish with a slow-motion video of herself screaming with the sound of a lion’s roar played in the background.I think we can all relate to her frustration.My lockdown revelation I am happy to report that I have given up ironing!WHEN it comes to illness, particularly cancer, I’ve long resisted all the talk of going into battle – mainly because of the unhelpful implication of weakness among those who “lose” that fight by dying.I feel the same way about descriptions of people “fighting” coronavirus.Illness is a fact of le. It is not a sign of weakness.The sad and terrible truth is that some people get this virus and others do not.Some have it very badly – a whole lot worse than others.We don’t yet know exactly why. We don’t even knowwe have the virus and may infect people.We don’t knowthere are antibodies that can protect us from getting it again, or how long that will take.We don’t knowthere will be a more deadly mutation of the same virus in the future.There is just too much we don’t know.But there are some practical things we can do.We need to help those who have it now, and the NHS and the Government are doing all they can in this regard.We also need to stop the spread of the virus, through testing. Hopefully that is going to happen soon.Meanwhile, scientists are also working around the clock to create a vaccine.Perhaps, most of all, we need to prepare for the possibility that this could all happen again.We need to learn lessons on food distribution, working from home, adapting our businesses – and having proper personal protection and hospital equipment ready and waiting.AS time ticks on, we are all realising what le is like without the things we used to consider necessities.Like our hairdressers.Claudia Winkleman’s Instagram post showing how unmanageable her fringe has become during lockdown made me laugh in recognition.My hair is grey, long and unkempt.On the one hand, it’s the least of my worries, which is quite liberating.Still, I did manage to get my hands on some hair dye for the roots.Do I care that it’s completely the wrong shade NO. I do not.So please, can we all just agree to turn a blind eye to the way we look when we finally emerge from lockdown HAPPY Easter Sunday, people. How will you be spending yours Personally, I have lost track of what day it is. The past few weeks have been a blur, with every day feeling like a cross between Sunday and Monday.It was my birthday last week and, without loved ones to hug, friends to see, drinks to be had, it was more or less just another day.Equally, this is the first time ever that Easter has felt like just another weekend.But I hope you can find ways to make it special. Just make sure you do so at home.THERE has been talk of schools possibly reopening after the Easter holidays – and who knows whether or not that is true But one thing I do know is that, whenever they do reopen, working parents will not only give the most massive sigh of relief, they will all be thanking their children’s teachers profusely for everything that they do.We will all also be thanking doctors, nurses, all NHS employees, as well as bin men, cleaners, shop assistants and all the other key workers we have under-paid and taken for granted.I really hope that is one thing which changes as a result of this pandemic.These people are the backbone of our country.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One says that restrictions should be lted sooner rather than later to reboot our ecomony, while the other argues that the restrictions are working, so now is not the right time to lt them.When Chancellor Rishi Sunak first announced his bail-out plan last month, it was estimated that ten to  per cent of workers in the ­private sector would need Government support.Now economic forecasters believe it could be a third of the total private sector workforce. That will cost the British taxpayer between £billion and £billion every three months.To date, about a fth of small businesses have been pushed into bankruptcy. If the lockdown continues to July, that figure will rise to a third.The effect of this on the economy will be catastrophic. According to the ­Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Britain’s GDP could contract by  per cent over the next two years. It shrank by six per cent during the global financial crisis of -.The Centre for Economics and Business Researchsays the lockdown is costing £.billion a day.Given we are now  days into the lockdown, this means we are already more than £billlion out of pocket.In short,we don’t ease off on the social distancing measures and re-boot the economy, we’re heading for the biggest economic downturn since the s.Against this, we are told thatwe end the lockdown more people will become infected, demand for critical hospital care will outstrip the NHS’s capacity and we’ll begin to see people dying in even greater numbers.I’m sceptical about that prognosis.It is based on the statistical modelling of Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, but there is mounting evidence that they under-estimated the percentage of the population already infected with coronavirus and over-estimated how deadly this disease is.According to Prof Ferguson’s model, fewer than five per cent of people have been infected. But according to another model, this one produced by Oxford University, it could be higher than  per cent, which would mean we are on our way to acquiring herd immunity.When Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, was asked at Thursday’s press conference what percentage of the world’s population has been infected, he put the figure at  per cent.If the true figure is between  and  per cent, the NHS can probably copewe ease off on some of the more extreme social distancing measures.Would ending the lockdown be ­gambling with people’s lives  Yes, but so will keeping it in place.Economic downturns cost lives, just as surely as viruses. During the global financial crisis of –, the suicide rate in Europe increased by . per cent. Economic recessions also cause a rise in poverty, domestic ­violence and murder.Philip Thomas, professor of risk ­management at Bristol University, has calculated thatour GDP falls by more than . per cent as a result of the lockdown, more years of le will be lost than saved.Politicians here and where have justied their cautious approach by ­saying they refuse to put a price on human le, as though the trade-off is between the lives of vulnerable people and economic growth.But the real trade-off is between the lives we might losewe end the ­lockdown tomorrow and the lives we know we will losewe keep it in place indefinitely.MPs aren’t being morally ­courageous. Rather, they’re just focusing on the next -hour news cycle, as they always do.What’s needed is a bold political leader who’s willing to risk some short-term pain to re-start the economy, thereby safeguarding all of our futures.I know of just such a person, but unfortunately he’s in hospital recovering from coronavirus.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe UK government’s measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic are just starting to make a ­dference.And with the three-week lockdown under review tomorrow, now is NOT the time to lt them.After a slow and indecisive start, the measures they now have put in place, including recommendations to stay at home, limiting travel, physical ­distancing, banning large gatherings and shutting shops and pubs, are just starting to show signs that they are slowing the spread of the virus.This means that there are fewer new cases, with fewer people becoming seriously sick and less demand on hospital beds, intensive care and articial ventilation.This means that the pressure on health services is reduced, which, in turn, will lead to fewer deaths from Covid- and other causes.Without the actions that have been taken and just letting the epidemic run its course, we would be likely to see more than half the population infected, and an overwhelmed health system with maybe five million hospital admissions and at least , deaths.The measures that have been taken in the UK have been of moderate strength compared to other countries.In France and Spain, the lockdown has been more severe, while in Sweden it has been less strict.The coronavirus epidemic can be thought of like a fire.If we starve a fire of oxygen, then the flames will stop and it will die down.So it is with the epidemic — reduce transmission from person to person and the number of cases will go down.Butyou let the oxygen come back too early, any embers in the fire will light up again and it will restart.So,we relax the lockdown too early, while there is still transmission of the virus going on, then the epidemic will restart.And that means that we would have wasted the efforts we have made so far.When transmission has stopped, or is at low enough levels that it can be monitored and each case and their contacts identied, isolated and treated, then the lockdown can be relaxed.We have not yet reached the peak of the epidemic, and we do not yet have the infrastructure in place for the systematic testing that will be needed to identy new cases, so now is not the time to relax the lockdown measures.Some people have talked about the serious damage done to the economy by measures the Government has put in place and the social disruption these have caused, in order to protect the public health of the nation.They have argued the lockdown will cause more harm than good in the long term. This is a  dilemma.Every le matters. Each person lost is a family member, a friend, a neighbour, a human being.They are not a number on a spreadsheet.This lockdown is the only way for us to get back on our feet.If left uncontrolled, the coronavirus by itself will cause social and economic disruption as well as damaging public health.It doesn’t need any help from politicians.It is up to us all, for the sake of ourselves, our families and our loved ones, to follow the rules, and our solidarity will allow the country totowards normal as soon as possible.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve never been so pleased to see my copy spiked.We now know from the PM himself just how close he came to death. But had things turned out dferently, my first sentence would still ring true.Boris would have paid the ultimate price for Covid-.The killer virus was spawned in China’s primitive “wet markets” and concealed by the country’s secretive communist regime and blamed by China on America and the West.Beijing’s claim of only , dead is a sick joke. The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world. So is the trade in human organs from executed prisoners.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealWho will stop China becoming the world’s dominant power It will be hard for our liberal elite to swallow, but the only answer is Donald Trump.The American President has already cracked down on China’s trade and currency cheating. Democrat rival Joe Biden — backed by peace-at-any-price Barack Obama — would kowtow to Beijing.At this pivotal moment in world history, it is reassuring to know President Trump has a high regard for our Prime Minister.Once Boris is back on his feet and coronavirus begins to fade, he must join forces with the world’s greatest superpower and address the smiling menace of Chinese President Xi Jinping.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.Boris was hardest hit, followed by chief of staff Dominic Cummings, who is only now ing to work after a fortnight in bed.A dozen others, including Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and No Press chief Lee Cain, went down like skittles.So who was the super-spreader The finger of suspicion is pointed at health supremo Matt Hancock, first in and energetically first out of self- isolation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Cabinet isn’t being asked to decide anything either.”The Cabinet’s regular Tuesday meeting today has been suspended for the second week in a row.Reports of deep splits over when to lt the lockdown among Boris Johnson’s top table in his absence were dubbed “premature” by another senior government insider.While work is being drawn up across several ministries, it also emerged that the Cabinet still hasn’t had a formal discuss about a lockdown exit strategy yet as a group.Another Cabinet source added: “Everyone is pretty much agreed that its vital to start getting people back to work as soon as possible, but there is also agreement that nobody has any clue how to do that safely yet.“We do have to be more transparent about the trade offs and what the choices are.“But there are  to  dferent iables going into any decision on when to relax restrictions, it’s incredibly complicated.” px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-CASES--APRIL-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Fresh alarm bells are also ringing in government about reports in South Korea that around  former Covid- sufferers have been re-infected with the disease.The Cabinet source added: “The evidence coming out of South Korea about secondary infections is concerning people, so we will need to wait for the medical evidence to work out what is going on there.”“This is a brand new virus and we still don’t really know how it operates.“The basic truth is the only way we can get out of this for good is a vaccine.”Yesterday leading members of SAGE had a preliminary video conference call, with one insider saying there was a broad consensus that they will not be recommending any lockdown measures be lted.The source said: “A consensus is building that it would be premature to relax measures given current uncertainties about what could come of it.People within government are actively looking at what measures could be lted and what the approach should be but they’re listening to science and the data.”PM Boris Johnson could be off work for several more weeks still as he convalesces at Chequers, and his powerful chief of staff Dominic Cummings is also still laid low with the virus.The law granting emergency coronavirus powers states a review of the lockdown must be carried out by Thursday.The PM’s official spokesman said: “Once the review is complete, we will set out the reasons we have taken the decision that we have, but I’m not going to pre-empt that.“We are very alive to the social consequences of lockdown.”On why the Cabinet wasn’t meeting again this week, the spokesman added: “The coordination to the coronavirus response is being done by the morning meeting and ministerial groups”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the moment before that.And probably every spare moment since he was obliged to leave the Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados, to go through the motions at this old ITV circus, for the th time of asking.Britain’s Got Talent, which began with Ant and Dec sentimentally evoking all the things they love about this great country of ours.The White Clfs of Dover, Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle, Russian sausage dog dancers, a Belgian contortionist, from Got Talent Espana, who scuttled across the stage in the spider position. That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz. BBC’s nearly perfect World Cup Rewind series .The quietly brilliant BBC News health correspondent Fergus Walsh and his cameraman Adam Walker deserving awards for their coronavirus reports from UCL Hospital.And the bloke from pest control making a polite exit from Channel ’s The Mum Who Got Tourette’s: “Did Simon tell you I had Tourette’s ”“The thing that gave it away was when you opened the door and called me a c***.”Smug THIS week’s winner is Phillip Schofield and the Mekon from Eagle comic.Sent in by David Thompson, via email. Picture research Amy Reading.But that’s care homes for you, I suppose.Steph McGovern using the phrase “I love it” an average of . times every show.Psychopathic Mexican drug cartels failing to deal with Gordon, Gino and Fred, on their ITV road trip, while they had the chance.And Have I Got News For You ler Ian Hislop claiming: “The Prime Minister’s in hospital, not good for comedy, is it ” ’Cos it wouldn’t be an issuehe A ever bothered cultivating a wider range of targets than just Boris and Trump and B was actually funny.The Steph Show, Jason Manford: “I’ve been watching the show, Steph, and it’s great.”The Steph Show, Steph McGovern: “I set a challenge for Ruth Davidson and Sandi Toksvig to find something in their house that’s a waste of space.”Challenge  That’s no challenge.

I have had the pneumonia vaccine. Does that give us any protection against Covid- A. I’m afraid it doesn’t. It specically protects against infection with a nasty bacteria called pneumococcus, which can cause a secondary bacterial chest infection in someone who has a viral pneumonia, but the vaccine does not protect against coronavirus itself.Q. My family and I have been in isolation for  days as I had symptoms. My daughter and I are due to go back to work. If my daughter gets symptoms do we all have to isolate again A. Yes you do. If any of you develop the symptoms of a dry persistent coughor raised temperature the process starts again.Once more testing becomes available to people in your position, we will know whether you need to self-isolate for sure or not. Until then it’s better to be on the safe side.Q. Does taking antihistamines help fight the Covid- infection A. Antihistamines have nothing to offer in the fight against Covid-. They have no antiviral action.Q. Where can I buy the antibody test for Covid- A. Please don’t buy an antibody test for the virus. To my knowledge, there is no accurate, reliable, validated test commercially available, and those that are advertised are at ridiculously inflated prices.Any reliable tests which become available should be reserved for frontline doctors and nurses and their families who may be self-isolating so we can discover which of them are immune and are therefore safe to go back to work with patients.Q. I have a chest infection. Am I more likely to get the virus A. Chest infections cause inflammation within the breathing tubes and lung tissue, which can lower resistance to secondary infections.Viral infections are often complicated by bacterial infections and this would be the only reason why antibiotics might be used.So you should stay at home, avoid visitors and practise physical distancing so you are not exposed to the virus while slightly more vulnerable.Q. My we and I have self-isolated for more than two weeks, as have our two daughters and their families. Nobody shows any symptoms, so why can we not now see each other, respecting social distancing A. We are asking everybody during lock-down to stay at home as much as possible, to avoid public transport, to work from homethey can and only to go out for essential supplies and to physically distance themselves from other people when they do.The more people come into contact with others, the more the virus will spread. If one infected person gives the virus to one fewer person than has previously been happening, the infection rate among the population will fall by  per cent.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q. Do people living alone need to wash their hands as often or disinfect their home as often as those who live together A. For people who live alone the risk is much lower. You will only be exposed to the virussomeone brings it to your home, such as a visitor or a delivery.So the need to wash your hands is less but you still need to do ityou are handling post, for example, or even stroking your neighbour’s cat or dog.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Gavin Williamson is said to be concerned about the impact schoolsapos closures can have on children - fearing in particular that poor and vulnerable students will be left behindschools remain closed into late May due to the outbreak of Covid-. At the moment, schools are only open for the children of key workers and other pupils are expected to study while staying at home. A source said Mr Williamson is worried about the lack of pupil-teacher interaction during this time as the pandemic continues to effect people globally. It comes after a senior Government source said that the prospect of lockdown restrictions being eased later this week was zero. A Government source told The Sun of Mr Williamson: He’s Education Secretary – he’d, of course, prefer schools to be open. But it’s not his choice. He is worried about all children and how they are going to do. There is no replacement for children going along to classes under the supervision of teachers who know them. However, schools will only be opened when it is safe to do so. The Cabinet is said to be split between hawks who want the lockdown to be lted in weeks and doves who believe it should last until Whitsun at the end of May.  Another source added to the Daily Mail: There is no replacement for children going along to classes under the supervision of teachers who know them. However, schools will only be opened when it is safe to do so. The decision to close the nationaposs schools last month was the toughest of his political career, Mr Williamson said last week. Another source said: “If you’re Gavin, you know there are a load of kids not getting free school meals, [suffering] malnutrition or suffering child abuse.” "},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer announces investigation leaked","story":"NewsKeir Starmer announces investigation into leaked Labour anti-Semitism reportThe document - which claims that Labour staff worked to undermine the Labour leader - will be examined by an independent investigatorShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  APR NewsMr Starmer has said the party will appoint someone to investigate the report and its content \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

It also claims that party officials opposed to Mr Corbyn worked to lose the  general election in the hope that a bad result would trigger a leadership contest to depose him. In a joint statement, Mr Starmer and his deputy Angela Rayner launched an investigation into the claims made in the document, how the evidence in it was gathered and how it was leaked.  The statement said: “We have seen a copy of an apparently internal report about the work of the Labour Party’s Governance and Legal Unit in relation to antisemitism. The content and the release of the report into the public domain raise a number of matters of serious concern. “We will, therefore, commission an urgent independent investigation into this matter. This investigation will be instructed to look at three areas. First, the background and circumstances in which the report was commissioned and the process involved. Second, the contents and wider culture and practices referred to in the report. Third, the circumstances in which the report was put into the public domain. “We have also asked for immediate sight of any legal advice the Labour Party has already received about the report. “In the meantime, we ask everyone concerned to refrain from drawing conclusions before the investigation is complete and we will be asking the General Secretary to put measures in place to protect the welfare of party members and party staff who are concerned or affected by this report.” The report claims to have found no evidence of anti-Semitism complaints being handled dferently to other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being motivated by anti-Semitic intent.

Government sources admit that ministers are debating how to balance tackling the coronavirus against the economic effect of the lockdown. One government source said: “We’re clearly concerned about the economic impact of all of this but public health is the absolute priority right now. “It would be wrong to look like bean counters at the expense of saving lives.” But another Cabinet source stressed that the health of the economy and the public’s health were intricately linked. They claimed to the Mirror: “It’s not a binary choice between protecting lives and protecting the economy, we want to protect both.” The source said modelling and analysis were ongoing so officials know what trade-off decisions need to be made. Other elements including the impact of poverty on the public’s health and delays to healthcare for other conditions will also be part of considerations. But the source added: “I don’t see how you can have a conversation about lting lockdown when you are still seeing an increase in the number of deaths.”  There are fears a longer closure of schools will damage the ­prospects of poorer children. But government sources have denied Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is pushing for them to reopen. They told the Mirror: “Schools are closed until further notice and that won’t change until the scientic advice changes.” The government expects to extend the restrictions at a meeting on Thursday, with experts arguing that the UK is not yet through the worst of the pandemic. Tonight First Secretary of State and PM Boris Johnson ’s stand-in Dominic Raab thanked the UK public for staying at home over the Bank Holiday weekend. He said: “People should be in absolutely no doubt that, by staying home this weekend, you have saved lives, and you also helped protect our precious NHS at this critical moment in the crisis.” The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need.

Whether itaposs a local business going the extra mile for the community or a teenager helping an elderly neighbour, we want to hear about it. You can email your stories of Mirror Coronavirus Heroes to webnews@mirror. He added: “We have come too far, lost too many loved ones and sacriced too much to ease up now.” Asked about plans to loosen lockdown restrictions, Mr Raab replied that it was “too early to talk about that”. After another  coronavirus patients died in UK hospital, the total stands at ,. It is the lowest increase recorded over the Bank Holiday weekend, after  on Friday, which surpassed the worst confirmed daily totals in Italy and Spain of  on Saturday and  on Sunday. But experts warned that the lower number was due to the holiday and not necessarily a sign of a slowdown.  Professor James Naismith of the University of Oxford added: “We will have to see further data before making any firm judgment as to trends.” Chief Scientic Officer Sir Patrick Vallance said: “When we are firmly the other side of it in terms of numbers coming down, only at that stage might we look at when those measures might be released.” The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies will meet today ahead of a decision on Thursday on whether or not to extend the lockdown. Figures show one in seven people who ended up in hospital with coronavirus in the UK have died. As of Sunday , people died with Covid- in NHS hospitals in England out of a total of almost , inpatients. It works out at a death rate of just over % for those who are admitted.

One option is for Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to sit alone in the Commons chamber with MPs participating via video link.

A murder investigation has been launched after the -year-old grandmother was found at her Staffordshire home. She had been reported missing by concerned relatives on Motheraposs Day and officers later broke into her home and made a chilling discovery. Police said that the retired midwe had a severe blunt trauma head injury. More details of the her death emerged as an inquest was opened and adjourned at North Staffordshire Coroneraposs Court. It comes as police secured a European Arrest Warrant as part of their attempts to extradite a -year-old man from Sweden. They say they want to speak to the man in connection with her death. The inquest was told how Wendy had been reported missing by her daughter on Sunday, March  after she failed to get any response when she knocked on the door of her Tunstall Road home. Police soon broke in and made the terrible discovery.  North Staffordshire assistant coroner Sarah Murphy said: The circumstances reported to the coroneraposs court are that the deceased lived alone and was having building work done at the house. She was not satisfied with the builder and another contractor was due to start. On March  via social media she last had contact with her family. Her daughter later sent her a message but it was not replied to. Her daughter became concerned and visited her on March . There was no reply to her knocking on the door and she found flowers on the doorstep sent by her brother. She became concerned and contacted the police and reported the deceased as a missing person.  Police arrived and checked the property and while at the back they noticed a curtain hanging from the window of the conservatory. They saw there was furniture covered and on the floor it looked like there was a body covered in plastic sheeting. They found the deceased on the floor in the conservatory. The deceased had a severe blunt trauma head injury. There were signs of a disturbance as there was glass and a bottle smashed on the floor. We donapost have a cause of death. A post-mortem examination has been requested and there is reason to suspect that the death was violent and unnatural and therefore an inquest is necessary.

Among them is British Red Cross volunteer Rukia Shepherd, , who knows all about helping out in a crisis, having already helped victims of the Manchester Arena bombing and Grenfell Tower tragedy in  As more of you sign up to join our Kindness Will Keep Us Together campaign, Rukia tells us how it’s done – and why it’s so worthwhile. She says: “Someone said to me, ‘I bet you’re sick and tired of this’ – but I’m not. I take pride in volunteering. “Things are so awful at the minute but showing people kindness can make a big dference – to us all.” She is part of an emergency response team looking after vulnerable people across the North West, and works for eight hours a day delivering food and supplies to struggling families. As we speak, she is queuing in a supermarket to collect shopping for people who cannot get out. She has spent the day collecting PPE gear and delivering essentials to homeless shelters, sourcing a new walking stick for a disabled mum and arranging for a cot to be delivered to a mum who had nowhere for her newborn to sleep, as well as dropping off food parcels to vulnerable families.  It is late and she is tired, but she sounds upbeat as talks about her “brilliant” day. She says: “Seeing the look on those kids’ faces when I dropped their food off – laughing and all excited – that makes it all worthwhile. You know they’re going to eat well and be OK.” She adds: “There are so many people who can’t get out, who can’t help themselves right now – soI can do it for them, I will.” The primary school teaching assistant lives in Manchester with pharmacy delivery driver husband Howerd, , and their three teenage kids. She was working at a school where several pupils and teachers were caught up in the Arena bombing when the Red Cross appealed for volunteers.  Rukia came forward to help comfort victims’ families at the Royal Oldham Hospital. She says: “Nothing prepares you for a scene like that. There was a deafening silence. As well as the families the staff were in shock.” But even among the horror, volunteering brought her hope. “There was strength, kindness but most of all humanity,” she says. “I’d never experienced that feeling so strongly before.” Weeks later the Grenfell Tower tragedy unfolded. “My gut instinct was to go,” she says. She spent two weeks looking after severely traumatised residents who had lost everything. “I remember one man in particular,” she says. “He had lost his -year-old daughter and was too numb to speak. I struggled to not become emotional.” Rukia is partly motivated by wanting to repay the kindness she was shown as a vulnerable young woman living in poverty and facing homelessness.

But the man there stayed to help me, he listened, made time for me when he didn’t have to. “Because of that I got the help I needed and I’ve never forgotten that – it made me realise how important it is to help and to listen.” Volunteering has also given her a sense of hope for the future. “When I go out in my workwear people smile at you as though they are comforted by your presence,” she says.People have asked me why I put myself through this.

A KFC spokesperson had said the closure was to help protect the well-being and safety of our teams and of our guests.With images of Brits flocking to beaches and joining other large gatherings, despite the Government advising strict social distancing measures, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made the decision to lock the country down.It’s not a decision we’ve taken lightly, but it’s in the best interests of both our incredible teams and all the fans that love our chicken, KFC said at the time.  The two Manchester shops have, however, quietly re-opened with a limed menu. A spokesperson said: “Over the last week, we’ve reopened our Deansgate and Hulme restaurants. They’re open for delivery only and are serving a limited menu, operated by fewer team members with new procedures in place to help ensure we’re following social distancing guidelines. There’s still a need for affordable, accessible food at this time - so we want to do our part. We’re also donating hundreds of meals from both restaurants to those on the frontline, including the NHS and key workers, in partnership with Deliveroo.” It is unclear whether other UK branches will also be re-opening.A photo appeared on Twitter yesterday of several Deliveroo drivers waiting outside KFCaposs Deansgate branch."},{"url":null,"title":"leading scientist claims government recklessly","story":"NewsLeading scientist claims Government recklessly allowed thousands to catch coronavirusEXCLUSIVE: Prof Helen Ward also warnscoronavirus Covid- restrictions are eased in the UK in a few weeks - like in Spain and Italy - a resurgence of cases is quite likelyShareCommentsByNick Sommerlad:,  APR NewsProfessor Helen Ward of Imperial College London\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

There will be a reckoning, and it will not be forgiving.” Prof Ward, of Imperial College London’s Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, told the Mirror the decision in early March to stop community testing and contact tracing was a “big problem” which meant we “lost sight” of the pandemic. Prof Ward said: “The Government instituted the lockdown on March . Ten days earlier it was clear we needed stringent social distancing – those ten days were lost. The World Health Organisation and other countries were recommending it while the UK was still pursuing ‘we know better’.” Asked why Britain’s epidemic was worse than countries like France and Germany, she said: “There was a lack of testing, lack of PPE, lack of ventilators and the lack of hospital beds and NHS capacity, a result of  years of cuts.” "},{"url":null,"title":"manufacturer shows cars workers driveways","story":"NewsManufacturer shows off cars from workers driveways during coronavirus lockdownSEATs Live Showcase service allows customers to have a look around new vehicles even though retailers have been shut down by the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-ShareCommentsBySWNS News:,  APR NewsSEAT Live Showcase expert, Tony, demonstrating a Tarraco SUV to a potential customer\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The conservationist, who has worked with Harry on a number of projects over the years, said she has been in touch with him since he and we Meghan Markle packed their bags and left the UK. The Sussex family officially quit The Firm at the start of the month, saying they planned to carve out a progressive new role within the Royal Family and become financially independent. Dr Goodall told Radio Times: I donapost know how his career is going to map out, but yes, Iaposve been in touch, though I think heaposs finding le a bit challenging just now. Last year, Harry interviewed Dr Goodall for Meghanaposs Forces of Change Vogue edition. Now they are no longer working royals, Meghan and Harry are free to make their own money and will be on the lookout for new projects. Meghan has already given her voice to a new Disney+ film, Elephant, which received reviews from critics.  However, she reportedly didnapost get paid for her role in the show, and instead arranged for a sizeable donation to be made to an elephant charity. In the interview, Dr Goodall was askedshe thought Harry and his brother Prince William were champions of the natural world, and she said: Yes, except they hunt and shoot. But I think Harry will stop because Meghan doesnapost like hunting, so I suspect that is over for him.  Meghan and Harry are both big fans of Dr Goodall, and invited her to their Windsor home Frogmore Cottage last summer before they moved to Canada. Speaking about her visit in a previous interview, she said Harry told her he didnapost want Archie growing up in the royal spotlight. Speaking to the  Daily Mail’s Weekend Magazine, she said: “At the end [of the conversation] Meghan came in to listen with Archie.  “He was very tiny and very sleepy – not too pleased to be passed from his mummy. I think I was one of the first to cuddle him outside the family. “I made Archie do the Queen’s wave, saying, ‘I suppose he’ll have to learn this’. Harry said: ‘No, he’s not growing up like thatapos. Dr Goodall is currently following self-isolationg and social distancing guidelines due to coronavirus. Speaking about how sheaposs dealing with the Covid- lockdown during her chat with Radio Times, she said sheaposs enjoying being at home but finds replying to emails more tiring than travelling the world.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailSome coronavirus sufferers have reported another three mild symptoms in addition to those well documented. It is now more than two months since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the UK. Since the virus first began edging its way towards the UK public health officials have warned that new, persistent coughs and fevers are tell-tale signs of the disease. Other, milder symptoms have also become hallmarks of the disease in recent weeks. These include physical and mental fatigue, loss of sense of smell and a lack of appetite.As more and more people have been struck down by Covid- and understanding of the disease has grown, an even fuller list of symptoms has emerged. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@trinitymirror   A buzzing sensation One of the more curious ones is a buzzing sensation that runs through the body. While it has not been listed as an official symptom to watch out for, many people have posted online about experiencing a aposfizzingapos sensation. Tarana Burke, recognised as the founder of the #MeToo movement, said that her partner had the illness and the sensation that his aposskin felt like it was burningapos. Twitter user @Miafia described having “an electric feeling on my skin.” Dr Daniel Grfin, chief of infectious disease at ProHealth Care Associates in the US, has suggested the feeling may be part of an auto-immune response to a patientsapos nervous system. “Clearly it’s been identied, but we’re just not sure yet how widespread it is,” he told the New York Post. Dr Vipul Shah, Clinical Director at telehealth service Pack Health, suggested it may simply be people experiencing a fever for the first time. Needing the toilet Another mild symptom of coronavirus that is being reported with increased regularity is the need to go to the toilet more often. Dr Diana Gall explained to the Express : Digestion problems and changes in bowel habits - particularly looser stools and making more frequent trips to the toilet - are sometimes the first signs that you’re coming down with something, not just with this coronavirus.  However, diarrhoea has been reported as an early symptom in patients who have later tested positive for Covid-. A new study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, analysed data  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and found nearly  per cent had diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. Isla Haslam, , from Balham, South West London, experienced stomach problems while suffering with the coronavirus. She realised that what she first thought was the consequences of a lentil heavy dinner was in fact coronavirus when she began to feel feverish. Testicular pain The third, slightly less common symptom of the coronavirus, is testicular pain. Researchers from  Hard Medical School filed a case report about a -year-old man who tested positive for the virus, after going to hospital with a ‘stabbing pain’ in his testicles. While doctors could find nothing wrong with his  testicles, and CT scan showed damage in his lungs. Two days later, the man was diagnosed with Covid-.  Unfortunately, because the man had atypical symptoms, several other patients and doctors may have unknowingly been exposed to the virus. While it remains unclear whether or not his testicular pain was linked to the virus, other viruses have been known to affect the testicles. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for seven days. You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild.Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others as it can take  days for them to appear. DO NOT go to your GP or hospital. Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice. Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Speaking to  MailOnline, Dr Viney, a surgeon in Birmingham, said: “There are certain viruses that can affect the testicles, such as mumps. “Only time will tellCOVID- also affects the testicles but it isn’t a symptom many of the patients I’ve dealt with have complained about.

When the nation needed their dedication, kindness and expertise, they answered that call and, in doing so, paid the highest of prices. These were not just the very best of the health service. They were loved ones, mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. And many of them would be alive todaythey had been provided with the proper kit. For all the wild promises by ministers there is still a woeful shortage of personal protection equipment. Stories from those working in our hospitals, clinics and care homes should shame the Government. Doctors and nurses are putting their lives in danger every day because they do not have enough masks, gowns, gloves and goggles. Faces of the NHS heroes who have died during the coronavirus pandemic Many are having to pay for their own equipment or are having to re-use existing kit. Others have resorted to fashioning make-sht gowns from bin liners. Instead of taking responsibility for this shameful situation, Health Secretary Matt Hancock insinuated that NHS staff were being too profligate in using what he described as “precious” equipment. Essential PPE should not be a luxury that needs rationing. It should be a basic right of anyone working in our health service at this crucial time. This is especially the case when so few frontline workers have been tested so far. Boris Johnson did not stint in his praise for the NHS workers who saved his le. The National Health Service, the Prime Minister said, is the “best” and the “beating heart of this country.” If Mr Johnson wants to show genuine gratitude these words must be matched by some genuine action. The Prime Minister is rightly recuperating, but the Government must redouble its efforts in his absence. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis. Whether itaposs a local business going the extra mile for the community or a teenager helping an elderly neighbour, we want to hear about it. You can email your stories of Mirror Coronavirus Heroes to webnews@mirror. Our political leaders have compared this moment of national crisis to a time of war. If they want to draw comparisons with previous battles then they should act with the same urgency that was shown in previous campaigns. During the Second World War our assembly lines were reconfigured to provide the necessary munitions.  Our industries should be transformed on a similar scale to provide the masks, gowns, goggles and gloves our key workers need. That is why the Mirror is launching our “Protect Us” campaign on behalf of all those serving the country at its time of need. We are demanding PPE is provided for NHS staff, carers, cleaners, porters, transport workers and anyone  who may be at risk. In the First World War the way the heroes in the trenches were let down by the officer class was compared to lions being led by donkeys.In the campaign against the coronavirus our angels on the medical frontline are being commanded by dullards. You should no more consider requesting our NHS staff and carers to tend for the vulnerable without gowns and masks than you would countenance sending soldiers over the top without rles and helmets.

Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS. It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan, a process which can take monthsnot years. The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections.Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the  Mail on Sunday  reported.The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. It is now being used around the globe in a race against time to find a cure and vaccine for the deadly bug, which has already infected more than .million people around the world and caused , deaths. For Zhengli the disocvery of the coronavirus gene sequence is the culmination of more than  years work, which has made her one of the worldaposs leading scientists in her field. But when the virologist received the fateful call on December  last year, just after the first patient samples had arrived at the lab in Wuhan, she admits she knew she would be about the battle her worst nightmare. And Zhengli had one overriding fear - had the new virus been accidentally unleashed by the lab she worked in. In the  years she had been working with bats, Zhengli had found the subtropical areas of China posed the biggest risk for the coronavirus being transmitted from animals to human - not the centre of the country where Wuhan is located. She said: I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China. I remember thinking aposcould they have come from our lab apos Zhengli was at a conference outside Wuhan when she received the terrying phonecall that would change the course of the world. Two hospital patients had an unusual type of pneumonia and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention needed Zhengliaposs expertise amid fears this new strain of the virus could be a deadly risk to public health. Her director told her to drop whatever you are doing and deal with it now and she was immediately on a train back to the lab in Wuhan. Zhengli and her team worked round the clock to find the genetic code of this new strain of coronavirus as the Covid- spread around the world like wildfire. But it was a moment she had spent her entire career working towards - starting with her first virus expedition back in . Zhengli travelled to bat colonies located in caves near Nanning, which she described as spellbinding. But the work was hard, with long hikes and risky decents into caves to find the creatures - and could often be frustrating. She was part of the team who were searching for the source of the SARS epidemic after a team from Hong Kong had reported that civets, which are similar to mongoose, had been the source of the virus and they were found in the subtropical parts of Asia and Africa. Before SARS the world had been blissfully unaware of the devastating impact of the coronavirus family but the epidemic led to a global push to both learn more and work to prevent a pandemic - and Zhengli was part of that early team. And the one thing that seemed to be key in the outbreak of a coronavirus was that they had started in bats before spreading to other animals and then humans. For months, work on the epedition was relentless with the team waking at dusk to work ovrnight when the bats had left the caves to hunt for food. They would collect blood, saliva and fecal swabs before grabbing a few hours sleep only tothe following morning to collect urine. For weeks there was no sign of coronavirus in the DNA that had been collected. Zhengli was heartbroken. She said: Eight months of hard work seemed to have gone down the drain. We thought coronaviruses probably did not like Chinese bats. At the end of their patience, the team were about tohome when another lab gave them a diagnostic kit for testing antibodies produced by people with SARS. Admitting she didnapost have high hopes it would work, Zhengli said she had nothing to lose by testing the samples and the results were incredible and was a turning project for the scheme. Antibodies against SARS were found in three species of horseshoe bats, which meant they were one step closer to finding the genetic code. After testing a huge number of sites, the team then narrowed their search down to the outskirts of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan and for the next five years they targeted their research on that area. Horryingly, the team discovered hundreds of strains of coronaviruses but thankfully just dozens were similar to SARS, could infect human lungs and were immune to vaccines and cures that had proved successful against other forms of the virus. And finally, in one cave, the scientists found what seemed to be the epicentre for SARS - but this came with an added risk. It meant millions of bats were mixing and creating increasing opportunities for the virus to evolve and for new strains to emerge. They also found that the virus could spread to those who werenapost directly handling the animals. People living in a nearby village had seen bats flying around. Six people had suffered from symptoms similar to SARS. And this was not the only time Zhengli and her team had found evidence bats were spreading a new strain of the deadly virus. Six miners had been struck down with an illness similar to SARS and when Zhengli investigated the mineshaft where they were working, they discovered it was covered in a disgusting-smelling fungus. The mine was closed immediately to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. Zhengli fears that the more humans move into areas previously havens for wildle, the greater the risk of unleashing new coronaviruses on the population. This coupled with the movement of wildle and livestock around the world, along with increased long-haul travel, creates conditions perfect for the potential spread of a pandemic - something Zhengli has long feared. A year ago, Zhengli and her team published a study warning of the potential of a bat-borne pandemic. Little did they know just  months later their doomsday predictions would come true. Then, at the turn of the year, everything they had been preparing for for the last  years suddenly needed to kick into action. Amplying the genetic material of the virus using the polymerase chain reaction technique Zhengli and her team found five of the infected patients had the same genetic sequences found in all coronaviruses. Zhengli admits she didnapost sleep at all during those first few days of frantic testing and a week after the first case had been reported she was certain a new strain of coronavirus has caused the sickness that had killed the patients - and Covid- was born. Chillingly, it also showed there had been just one point where the virus had passed from animals to human and had then spread through human to human contact - until it covered the world. They also found the virus could have been in existance for months but hadnapost started to spread until it reached Wuhan - and its wildle markets where animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls. They sell a range of creatures, such as bats, civets, pangolins, badgers and crocodiles, although Zhengli and her team believe the virus came directly from the bats themselves. Almost two months after the first cases of the virus emerged in Wuhan, China permanently banned wildle consumption and trade. It is estimated this will forced million people out of work and cost the Chinese economy about £billion, however, Zhengli believes the consumption and trade of wildle is not the whole problem. Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves.Le is Wuhan is slowly ing to normal, although China has recorded its highest number of daily new  coronavirus  cases in almost six weeks, sparking fears of a second wave of Covid- after restrictions were eased.A total of  new coronavirus cases were reported in mainland China on Sunday, up from  a day earlier and marking the highest number of cases since  infections were reported on March . But for two months Zhengli barely left her lab and survived on nothing but instant noodles as she and her team worked to not only identy the virus but come up with the key to a cure. The found how it gets into human lungs and are now working on drugs that can block it, as well as trying to come up with a vaccine and trial it on people. Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic.

Officials say the sudden rise is due to infected travellers arriving from abroad, many of them crossing the border from Russia. A total of  new coronavirus cases were reported in mainland China on Sunday, up from  a day earlier and marking the highest number of cases since  infections were reported on March . Heilongjiang province, which borders Russia in the north-east, has become Chinaaposs new battleground against Covid- as the rise threatens to push the entire country back into a state of near paralysis. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. The National Health Commission said  of the new cases - or more than  per cent - were imported, a new record. A total of  Chinese nationals who entered Heilongjiang province from Russia tested positive. Our little town here, we thought it was the safest place, said a resident of the border city of Suenhe, who only gave his surname as Zhu. Some Chinese citizens they want to come back, but itaposs not very sensible, what are you doing coming here for   Though the number of daily infections across China have dropped sharply from the height of the epidemic in February, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March  because of the rise in imported cases. Chinese cities near the border with Russia are tightening border controls and imposing stricter quarantines in response to influx of infected patients from the country.  Suenhe last week announced restrictions on movements and gatherings similar to those imposed in Wuhan city, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged late last year, and extended the closure of its border with Russia. The land route through the city had become one of few options available for Chinese nationals trying to get into China after Russia stopped all flights to the country.  Suenhe and Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang, are now mandating  days of quarantine for all arrivals from abroad as well as nucleic acid and antibody tests. Streets in Suenhe were virtually empty on Sunday evening due to restrictions of movement. Residents said a lot of people had left the city as the number of infected people crossing the border from Russia rose. I donapost need to worry, Zhao Wei, another Suenhe resident, told Reuters. If thereaposs a local transmission, I would, but thereaposs not a single one. Theyaposre all from the border, but theyaposve all been sent to quarantine. In Shanghai, authorities found that  people who arrived on Aeroflot flight SU from Moscow on April  have the coronavirus, Zheng Jin, a spokeswoman for the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, told a press conference on Monday.  China has cut the number of people crossing its borders by  per cent and has tried to stop all non-essential journeys, said Liu Haitao, an immigration official, at a separate briefing on Monday. Our border is long, and apart from the border crossings and passages, there are a large number of mountain passes, paths, ferry crossings and small roads, and the situation is very complicated, he said. Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Center for Diseases Prevention and Control in Beijing, said the trend for local transmission of the disease in the capital was low. Imported cases are still the highest risk in Beijing in the second half of April, Pang said, adding that nearly eight per cent of the , nucleic acid tests carried out in the city since April  had been conducted on people who had come from abroad. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China now stands at , as of Sunday.  At the peak of the first wave of the epidemic on February  there were over , new cases. Though the number of daily infections across China has dropped sharply from that peak, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March  because of the rise in imported cases. China has been accused of underreporting its total number of infections. China hid work of Bat Woman scientist China is accused of hiding the findings of a coronavirus expert - known as Bat Woman - after she quickly identied the genetic make-up of the new strain that has infected millions. Wuhan-based virologist Shi Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS.  It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan. But she was muzzled and her team was ordered not to reveal any information about the new disease, which was already spreading rapidly as China kept the world in the dark. The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections. Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the Mail on Sunday reported. The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. The day that the genetic information was mapped, Yanyi Wang, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, ordered staff not to reveal any information about the disease, it is claimed. After local doctors were detained for warning locals about the virus, the director claimed inappropriate and inaccurate information was causing general panic.  She ordered staff not to post any information on social media or speak to the media. Just over a week later, a team in Shanghai published a sequence on an open access  after studying samples from an infected patient. Their laboratory was shut for rectication two days later. One of the earliest Covid- cases emerged in mid-December when a patient, who worked at a wildle market in Wuhan that became the early epicentre of the outbreak, was hospitalised with a double lung infection in the city in central China. The usual treatment for flu-like illness failed to work and new cases soon emerged. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis. Whether itaposs a local business going the extra mile for the community or a teenager helping an elderly neighbour, we want to hear about it. You can email your stories of Mirror Coronavirus Heroes to webnews@mirror. On December , Wuhan health officials were told that the illness was being caused by a new coronavirus. Three days later, at least two doctors from Wuhan - Li Wenliang and Ai Fen - shared information about the new virus on the social network WeChat. Li, a whistleblower who was warned by police to stop making  comments, died in February after contracting the virus. Ai is missing after giving media interviews criticising Chinaaposs censorship and hospital authorities for suppressing early warnings of the outbreak. She told the Chinese magazine, Renwu, or People, that she was reprimanded after alerting her bosses and colleagues of the new virus in December.  On  December, she received the laboratory results of one case which stated: SARS coronavirus. The next day, Wuhan officials confirmed almost  cases, shut down the wildle market and notied the World Health Organisationaposs local office about the mysterious illness. New cases continued to emerge and the outbreak was spreading outside of China, but for a week in January health officials in Wuhan insisted they had not received any new patients. During that time, the first known case outside of China was detected in Thailand and a case was reported in the US as infected people left Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province to travel across the country and around the world. Chinese authorities insisted they hadnapost seen any clear evidence that the virus could be spread from human to human.  By then they had lost control and hospitals were becoming overwhelmed by the rising number of infected patients. Within days Dr Zhong Nanshan, the countryaposs top respiratory expert and the face of its containment effort, revealed that human transmission was taking place. Wuhan and several other cities struggling to contain the virus went into lockdown on January , days before the Lunar New Year holiday, but by then millions of people had left without being screened. That day, Shi Zhengli and her research team published their data identying the illness on a scientic portal before it was published in February by the medical journal Nature. In the weeks that followed the lockdown in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread to and within other countries due to imported cases and community transmission.  China is still censoring academic research into the origins of the new strain of coronavirus. The authorities have placed new restrictions on the publication of research that could shed new light on how it was passed from an animal to a human. All academic papers are being given extra vetting before being submitted for publication, it emerged on Monday. Studies must be approved by the central government before they are shared with the rest of the world, according to since-deleted online posts by two Chinese universities. A researcher told CNN that the new restrictions were another attempt by China to cover up its failures and would likely disrupt important scientic research. The researcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation, added: I think it is a coordinated effort fromChinese government to controlnarrative, and paint it asthe outbreak did not originate in China. And I donapost think they will really tolerate any objective study to investigate the origination of this disease. PPE bound for UK held up by red tape Meanwhile, personal protective equipmentis being sent from China to the UK amid shortages at healthcare facilities in Britain and the deaths of almost  NHS workers. However, much of the kit from China is unusable because it fails UK safety checks.  Some shipments are being held up by red tape in China, the worldaposs biggest supplier of PPE, and some are wrongly labelled and do not contain the right gear, it has emerged. For example, a crate is labelled gowns but it contains masks instead. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast there were concerns about a shortage of PPE in some hospitals. Stocks of gowns have run critically low, he added. Mr Hopson said the supply of gowns - imported from China - was hand-to-mouth.

He said in a televised address to the nation: Over the next four weeks, the rules must be respected. He also apologised for his government aposnot being prepared enoughapos for the crisis. Were we sufficiently prepared  Obviously not – no one is prepared for a crisis of this magnitude, he said. Macron added that by May , France would be able to test every citizen presenting Covid- symptoms and schools would be gradually reopened. George Eaton, senior online editor for the New Statesman, tweeted: It will be surprisingthe UK doesnapost mirror this. It comes as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab today said that it is far too early to talk about relaxing Covid- lockdown measures in the UK despite positive signs from official data. Speaking at Mondayaposs Downing Street press conference, Mr Raab said figures indicated the UK was starting to win this struggle against the virus but warned it was still not past the peak. He praised the British public for staying at home during the Easter weekend, adding: Our plan is working. Please stick with it and weaposll get through this crisis together.  Meanwhile, Macron admitted his country had not been sufficiently prepared early on to face the challenges posed by the outbreak of the coronavirus, but said the unprecedented restrictions put in place had started showing results. He said: The epidemic is starting to slow down. The results are there. Thanks to your efforts, everyday we have made progress. But our country was not sufficiently ready for this crisis. Franceaposs residents have been under lockdown for four weeks - they must stay at home except to buy food, go to work, seek medical care or get some exercise on their own.  As part of the package of support for people affected by the crisis, he also announced aid for lowest-income families and students. The country will also keep its borders with non-European nations closed until further notice, he said. After a relentless increase until the first week of April, the number of patients in French hospitalsapos intensive care units has started to decline, but nursing homes have reportedly been overwhelmed.  France has so far reported , deaths linked to Covid-, with more than , confirmed cases, according to official figures. Although Macronaposs popularity initially shot up after he followed Italy and Spain in introducing drastic curbs on public le, his government has faced accusations of failing to address a shortage of masks and testing kits. Meanwhile, three weeks into the nation-wide lockdown in the UK Mr Raab said the Government did not expect to make any changes following a review of social-distancing measures by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieslater this week. Mr Raabaposs comments came after the coronavirus-related hospital death toll passed ,, with the Foreign Secretary facing questions over whether more lives could have been savedthe UK had acted faster.  He rejected any like-for-like comparison with other countries, saying it depended on each nationaposs inidual circumstances and how far along the coronavirus outbreak curve they were. But the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the UK would be looking to learn from other countries on how they approach releasing lockdown measures. Questions were also raised about whether the number of coronavirus-related deaths in care homes were being properly recorded.  Englandaposs chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said he wanted testing in the sector to be increased due to the large numbers of vulnerable people at risk. The Department of Health said , people had died in hospitals as of pm on Sunday, with many more expected in care homes. It means the UK has more recorded deaths than any country except the US, Italy, Spain and France.  Mr Raab admitted the government had been concerned that the public might start ignoring the advice or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine over the Easter weekend. But he added: In fact the overwhelming majority of people stayed at home and understood the importance of doing so. By staying home this weekend, youaposve saved lives. Earlier Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman maintained the UK was still on course to carry out the Governmentaposs pledge of , coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month as he said , had been conducted in the  hours to Sunday morning.

Wu Hanshi - which translates as Wuhan City - lives in the city of Linyi in east China’s Shandong Province. The -year-old began trending on social media at the weekend when he revealed that he had named his second son Wu Chang, after Wuhan’s Wuchang district in China’s central province of Hubei.The dad-of-two revealed that both he and his cousin, Wu Hanxing, , donated towards coronavirus charities in Wuhan during the height of the outbreak in February.Explaining the origins of his bizarrely apposite name, Mr Wu said: “I don’t want to ulge too much about the past, but basically there was a village neighbour who had a son called Wu Hanxian , so my dad called me Wu Hanshito spite him. “But the past is the past.”  Unsurprisingly, Mr Wu said he is fond of Wuhan, and often visited the city before the pandemic began in late . He told local media: “I used to go to Wuhan a lot. I’d post online saying: ‘Wuhan is in Wuhan!’ “I really like the city of Wuhan. And besides, I have some affinity with it.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/8765e58b-98cf-47bb-8bda-bf67f7280ca2-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/8765e58b-98cf-47bb-8bda-bf67f7280ca2-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/8765e58b-98cf-47bb-8bda-bf67f7280ca2-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/8765e58b-98cf-47bb-8bda-bf67f7280ca2-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"a job for life charismatic muriel loved her university of dundee job so much she only managed to retire for 10 weeks","story":"From the second I step through the revolving doors of Dundee University#s Tower Building, I know exactly who Muriel Duncan is.

She stayed in the role until , before moving into a position working directly with postgraduate students.#I loved it,# she explains. #I really enjoyed all the work with overseas students.# Muriel witnessed plenty of changes in the years that followed postgraduate student numbers soared from around  in the early s to , at the turn of the century and new buildings sprung up around the campus.#We moved from Cross Row, onto the seventh floor of the Tower Building, before ending up at Airlie Place,# she says. The busiest time of the year was always that four-month period between June and October, as the team worked constantly to ensure the admissions process ran smoothly.#It was just mad during that time. I was working a lot of overtime, coming to work in the evenings and catching up but I thoroughly enjoyed it.#There were four of us working in the office at one point. We all worked brilliantly together and did each other favours. We still all keep in contact two of them are still at the university.#In  Muriel made the decision to retire, but only managed  weeks before ing to work # this time in a dferent role. She#d passed a remark to a colleague, around six months prior to her retirement, about an ambition to work on the university reception at one stage.#And then, after I was away for  weeks, I got a phone call one morning and he said to me #you once said that you would like to work in the reception. Well, we#re looking for someone now.# ##When can I start # I replied.

The -year-old recently celebrated  years service at Boots and can#t quite put her finger on what it is that has kept her at the company for so long.She thinks it#s a combination of factors from her love of driving and passion for working with prescriptions, to her friendships with colleagues and relationships with staff working in the surgeries and shops across the city.I ask Maureenshe remembers the date of when she first started working at Boots. It#s clear it is etched in her memory as she tells me without faltering: #January st . I started as a sales assistant in Lochee before moving onto the chemist counter, approximately two years later.#After that, Maureen transferred to the site#s store on Reform Street where she worked on the photo-lab and in the children#s department.Finally, she found her calling and took on the #cushy# van driver role. She#s now been doing that job for  years, and hasn#t looked back once.#I love my job. For some reason, I#ve always loved working with prescriptions picking them up from doctor surgeries and delivering them to stores across the city,# she says.#The thing about this job is you maintain great relationships with the surgeries and shops and you feel really close to all their members of staff.#I#m very loyal to Boots because they#ve treated me so well over the years. Plus, we all work as a team I#m always having a gossip with my colleagues. Instead of getting called Maureen, they call me Mo. There are only two people amongst the shops and surgeries that call me by my actual name. When I come back after a week#s holiday a lot of them say, #oh we#re glad to see you back Mo.# I just love it.#The Monieth resident, who works Monday to Friday from around am to pm, has always gone above and beyond in her role.#The customers used to come in and say #I want Maureen to serve me. She knows what I#m wanting.# I was that good with them. I#ve always had a brilliant rapport with them.#There have been a lot of change over the years, including managers and other things that I think should have just been kept the way they were, but you#ve got to move with the times you have to adapt.#We#re doing things like e-learning now which we never used to have to do. We#ve not been affected by the internet yet, but seemingly it#s coming. Some of the stores, such as the one on Reform Street, send their scripts away and get them back a couple of days later all packed up.

This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time.

I was desperate to just get in and experience it.“But it got to the point that Michael O’Neill heard I could play with Northern Ireland [through a Coleraine-born grandparent].“He called Allan Preston [football agent] and Alan called me.“I said, ‘Can you ask Craig what the chances with Scotland would be ’ To be fair to Craig, he said, ‘I’d never say it’s a definite no buthe’s got the chance to play international football then I’d take it’.“Without saying ‘definitely no’, he definitely did say no!“I’ve still got mixed emotions about it. My dad wasn’t too sure, he didn’t want me to do it.“Other people advised me to do it and I had some great trips. I got one cap but I was in the squad seven or eight times.“Getting to train with people like Jonny Evans, Steven Davis…I loved the training and I loved the trips.“I would’ve liked to get more game time but it was causing a problem to my back and ultimately that’s why I stopped.”He made his Northern Ireland debut in a - hammering at the hands of the Netherlands on June , , just weeks after his Hibs side were beaten - by Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final.McPake – who came up against Dutch stars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie – said: “It wasn’t like a normal friendly, it was mayhem.“The Amsterdam Arena was packed. I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there. I often say that to Dawn [we]. I love it up there.“In terms of players, Cammy [Kerr] was there – he was only a young boy.

increase in support need","story":"An Aberdeen children#s charity has seen an % increase in the need for its support services in the past month.Charlie House, which supports children and young people with complex disabilities and or le-limiting conditions and their families, reported the huge increase on its figures in March compared to the same time in February.Due to the outbreak of Covid- and lockdown measures put in place by the UK Government, families have been in self-isolation.Last month, the charity provided support to families on more than  occasions, and continues to support those who need help despite many regular events being cancelled.Leigh Ryrie, children and family support manager at Charlie House, said: “Given these unprecedented times and the impact of Covid-, the services team have been inundated with the need for family support during the month of March.“Periods of isolation for the families we support are not uncommon as even a regular cold can have a serious impact on a child with a complex disability and le-limiting condition, so the families are used to ying degrees of confinement.“However, this period is unprecedented.“Families may have siblings who are no longer in school during the day so they have additional childcare needs at a point when they may no longer be able to receive their regular carers in their home, taking away much-needed respite care when it is more needed than ever.#Couple that with the entire family under one roof and loss of earnings for some and there is a huge additional strain on the families for an unknown period of time.”To help families cope, Charlie House has moved from its normal face-to-face meetings to virtual support via calls, email, video and texts.They are also holding virtual siblings clubs, virtual show and tells and more, as well as delivering isolation packs pre-lockdown.Charlie House’s community nurse is also continuing to provide support from the Royal Aberdeen’s Children’s Hospital.To allow them to continue, Charlie House is urgently appealing for donations, as the cancellation of all its major fundraising events has put huge financial pressure on it."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/5e940dd1957290.49340185-564x564.jpg ","title":"coronavirus north east man tells of lockdown easing in

toto normal.But Richie, , said people are still fearful of the disease re-emerging.He said: “The lockdown is now over in China, but some businesses like nightclubs are not open yet.“There is a ban on any kind of musical performance or event that would attract crowds.“Senior academy pupils are back in school to prepare for their big exams, but primary, middle and university students are still off.“There is still a sense of fear. The majority of people are still not going out unless it’s for work or essentials.“There are still daily asymptomatic cases of Covid- being found all over China, so the virus has still not been totally wiped out. Many don’t want to risk coming across it and paying the price.”He added: “The government are very determined to convince people it’s safe to go out, to spend money and consume, as they need to spark the economy. But the general public are happier to gradually get back to their normal lives.“There’s an air of distrust of anything public.”Richie, who lives in Hefei with his we Ting Ting and son Dylan, was due to fly back to the north-east later this year for a wedding.However, the virus has put paid to his trip home.He said: “I really can’t wait to get back to Scotland, but at the moment I’m probably in the safest place.“I had flights booked for a wedding in June, but there’s no chance of me making it.“Word on the street is China’s borders will be locked until August and eventhey open before that, I would be quarantined in a Covid hotel for two weeks upon ing to China.”Richie urged people back home in Scotland to adhere to lockdown regulations and make use of protective equipment in order to overcome the virus.He said: “Stay home and wear a mask when you have to go outyou can get them.“It’s that simple, it’s the only way to beat it.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53399590-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53399590-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53399590-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53399590-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"north east residents win 1000 each in peoples postcode lottery draw","story":"Two north-east residents have won £, each.The residents of Rickarton, near Stonehaven, won the prize when AB TH wasPeople’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson said: “Congratulations to our winners!

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd.

Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

The most-quoted line is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Noble said the idea behind the forthcoming book, titled Conquered by No-one, was that  modern-day Scots would write about the  signatories to the Declaration.But Mr Noble himself is writing about two iniduals ndash William Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, and Malise IV, Earl of Strathearn.Authors of other chapters include Linklater ndash former editor of The Scotsman ndash and historian Murray Pittock.Mr Noble said: ldquoWhat I see as the underlying justication of this publication is to try to raise the profile of the Declaration of Arbroath as the most signicant document in Scottish history.Mr Noble said the -year-old document introduced the concept of government by consent to Scotland.ldquoI think thatrsquos the critical thing and why itrsquos the most important document in Scottish history, said Mr Noble.ldquoItrsquos recognised by the United States Senate as a contributing factor in the discussions that took place before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in  and itrsquos something that has had a status in the English-speaking world for quite a long time, but lost its traction in Scotland.Mr Noble said a recent survey of Scots found that around a third did not know much about the Declaration.The same poll revealed that many supporters of Scottish independence viewed the Battle of Bannockburn as more important, said Mr Noble.Asked for his own thoughts on Scottish independence, Mr Noble noted that he has lived in England for many years so would not be allowed to participate.Buthe were permitted, he would choose to remain in the United Kingdom, he said, albeit with the hope that a federal system would eventually emerge.Mr Noble said: ldquoI donrsquot think Scotland is going to stay as it is ndash I think decisions in the main should be made in Edinburgh but I believe in shared sovereignty and I think therersquos a value in being part of the UK.He added: ldquoIrsquom not yet persuaded that complete independence is in Scotlandrsquos interests but I certainly think we should be going a lot further in that direction than we are at the moment.Mr Noble is the chairman of the Royal Caledonian Trust, a charity that supports the education of Armed Forces children. He is immediate past president of the Caledonian Society of London.During his career as a teacher, he was headmaster of Bexley, London, which was then the largest school in the capital. When he was a schoolboy himself, he attended Peebles High School.Conquered By No One will be published later this month by Hammer  Mirror Books.

I was definitely not expecting it to get as big, but I guess that is how social media works.ldquoI canrsquot believe how much itrsquos spread. All I wanted was two or three people to smile and Irsquove managed to do just that.ldquoIrsquom quite surprised at how many people of all generations it has attracted. Itrsquos bringing them all back to their younger days.ldquoTherersquos some bears that have been posted in the group that are  years old and falling to bits, people are going up into their attics and bringing their own old ones down and are telling stories from when they were a child.ldquoTherersquos been over , comments so far and most of them are people sharing their childhood stories, they arenrsquot even talking about the virus.Jodie said that Lexii has been collecting beanie baby teddy bears since she was born so is ldquovery excited to get them all out.She added: ldquoItrsquos given her that distraction that she needed. Shersquos been out with Steven looking for more.Jodie is in talks with people who can knit bears and is hoping that a bunch can be made and auctioned off, she is hoping this will happen in the next couple of weeks.The bears are going to be NHS bears and will also be raising money for them."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-isolated-not-alone","story":"THIS virus has had a devastating effect on so many people in so many ways. Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

Hotel owners Cameron and Susan Law intend to step down from the business, which has been in the family for  years,the proposals are given the green light.Susan, who was previously chairwoman of Muirfield Riding Therapy, which offers free horseriding for people with disabilities, stressed that The Mallard Hotel would remain open prior to any development.At the time of the public exhibition, she told the Courier: ldquoI think, initially, I was quite shocked that it was going to be knocked down but in retrospect it is the best thing, really.ldquoObviously, we will be sad to see it go but we will take The Mallard Hotel with us, is how I am thinking now.

We produce a range of styles, from classic IPA, Drop, through the multi-award-winning Fathom , Spinnaker , and Drt .We also have Wave, our weissbier, Surf, our pale ale with a twist, and Capsize, our blonde beer.

Where do you feel the anxiety  Be conscious of what your body is telling you. Is your heart racing, stomach churning  To help ease these symptoms, be mindful of your breathing. Inhale through your nose for  slowly and exhale through your mouth again counting to  slowly. Repeat this exercise four times.AwarenessWe cannot control how her lersquos have changed due to this pandemic but what we can control is our thoughts to this global crisis. To quote from the Greek philosopher Epictetus ldquoPeople are not disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of them. Through awareness of how our thoughts make us feel, we can challenge these to more positive helpful thoughts. Awareness is the key to unlocking our distorted thoughts and through recognising whether we are for example predicting, judging or catastrophising, this can assist us in challenging and changing these negative obtrusive thoughts to more positive helpful ones.Self-CareTake this time as an opportunity to look after self. Self-care is crucial for building up resilience to le events and there is no time more important than in the now to engage in self-care: it is a priority. Self-care consists of several elements:Physical self-care such as nutrition, exercise and sleep.Mental self-care such as being aware of our thoughts and behaviours and engaging in activities such as crosswords. Emotional Self-care such as being aware of our emotions for example anger and sadness and how these can be managed. For example, through keeping a daily journal to recognise the triggers for our emotions.Spiritual Self-care such as awareness of when our minds are racing with thoughts and to try and be still. Engage in activities such as meditation, mindfulness and through being still in the now this will quieten the racing mind and provide strength at this challenging time. Take time to assess your self-care by implementing a self-care plan and commence small steps to change through looking after self. ldquoAn empty lantern provides no light. Self-care is the fuel that allows your light to shine brightly. If you find yourself struggling with anxiety, low mood or lapsing into unhelpful ways of coping, then contact Sharon.

Situated on the banks of the River Teviot, in an award-winning conversion of the former Victorian electrical works, the distillery is laying down spirit for a future Single Malt release, makes an excellent gin, and recently released a vodka.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin is genuinely Scottish Gin ndash wholly distilled from barley grown within  miles of the distillery. It is named after William Kerr ndash Hawick-born, and among the th centuryrsquos most accomplished botanists. He sent  plant specimens back to Kew Gardens from his Far East travels.Kerr would likely have approved of the distilleryrsquos Carterhead Still ndash one of only a handful in operation. It gently heats the botanicals rather than boiling them like most other gin stills, capturing more of the subtle flavours. Together with the barley, this gives the gin a distinctive depth. The rounded flavour works well with the bitterness of tonic water, creating a beautully balanced GT.The newest addition to distilleryrsquos range is Puffing Billy Steam Vodka ndash unfiltered malted barley vodka, named after the special still which plays a key role in its production. The spirit is steamed through charcoal inside the still itself and never filtered as a liquid, preserving the delicious character of the barley.Itrsquos the only vodka in the world made this way, and drinks commentators have praised the result, suggesting it could reinvigorate vodka, a spirit somewhat overlooked during the recent gin boom. Fabulous with tonic or Ginger Beer, the vodka also tastes incredibly smooth sipped chilled and straight.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin and Puffing Billy Steam Vodka are available direct from the distilleryrsquos online shop, currently offering free delivery anywhere within the UK when you buy a bottle.See www.thebordersdistillery shop ------------------------------------------------The Mortgage Advice Service ScotlandRe-mortgaging During the Coronavirus OutbreakAlthough health concerns are their immediate priority, people are searching for ways to reduce their monthly expenditure and cutting their biggest monthly outlay makes financial sense.Although the Coronavirusis having a signicant impact on obtaining funds for purchasing a new home, re-mortgages are still available from lenders at competitive rates and depending on the size of your mortgage, you could make substantial savings each month by simply changing lenders.Re-mortgaging neednt be a hassleEvenyou can save hundreds of pounds by shopping around, the thought of trying to switch your current mortgage may seem like a hassle you could do without.However, re-mortgaging isnt nearly as much hassle as you may think, because, thats where we step in and do all the work that is involved in finding you a fresh deal that can lower your monthly payments and maybe even help you to pay off your mortgage quicker.Choosing the right mortgage can be tricky.Next to purchasing your home, choosing the right mortgage is probably one of the most important decisions you will make when you are looking for a new deal.Approaching your current lender or bank may not result in you obtaining the best mortgage deal because they generally only consider their own products.

In those first weeks, it seemed all too early. Some out there were identying silver linings, like the fake news that there were dolphins in the canals of Venice, or that ndash and this was true ndash pollution had almost melted away over China, or even that we could hear the birdsong better. But it felt to me we were too early in the grief cycle of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Therersquos a hope that is about not accepting what has happened, or its true gravity. I wanted to resist that  hope.Still, itrsquos Easter and now Irsquom listening to the blackbirds singing ndash in the dead of night ndash and thinking about hope. For in the tiny moments when I can step back from my fear for myself and loved ones, hope is what I find myself looking for. Itrsquos all too easy to gaze out and see only the story that ends badly, the oncoming economic depression in which the poor are made poorer and the rich hold on to their wealth and health, or the segueing of disasters, one into another, in which our children find themselves lurching from pandemic to climate crisis. Many of us are finding that our thoughts are in a very black place. The nights can be long and wakeful.So we do need to foster hope ndash and thatrsquos an active process. You have to work at it. You have to plant seeds. You have to water them. Hope doesnrsquot really last without doing anything. It doesnrsquot survive long as just an idea in your head. Itrsquos all about finding those grains of something you can work with. And they exist ndash itrsquos just they seem more dficult to access, more virtual, in an era when we are being told to stay at home. Even the reaching out wersquore doing across the internet is a start. Even our clapping for the NHS provokes hope that we can come together and create a society in which our carers are valued.Many people are already looking for new roles ndash what they can do, not only to help others now, but perhaps as part of some human movement towards creating a better society, somewhere at the almost unimaginable end of all this. Wersquove signed up for things. Wersquove helped neighbours out. Wersquove felt inadequate, and worried we have nothing to offer. Wersquore still trying to work out , and how, the things we used to value and fight for matter in this new universe. Many of them still do. What we always used to hope for ndash a fairer world, a new relationship with the environment, an end to homelessness ndash seems all the more important now, evenour immediate concern is the virus threat. As Rebecca Solnit wrote this week: ldquoOne of our main tasks now ndash especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing dficulties ndash is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.These problems ndash how to reinvent our economic system, how to change our physical impact on the planet or how to rejuvenate mental health ndash are issues people have been proposing solutions to for some time. There are blackbirds out there that have almost been waiting for this moment to arise. It may seem crazy to hope that this crisis could be what propels these ideas into action, but one thing about the dramatic change we are experiencing is that it does make other change feel more possible. We now see, for instance, that we donrsquot have to constantly travel around trailing emissions. People can stop flying. Homeless people can be put into empty Airbnb flats. The British state can reinvent itself at startling speed. The virus has brought many terrying changes with it ndash but some of the changes it has brought are in themselves, hope. Irsquoll water that.TWITCHYcoronavirus rulesThe curtains are twitching. The smartphones are twitching too, every time someone sees someone out in the park, not quite keeping the two-metre rule, even though they may be a group that lived crammed together in a small flat with zero outdoor space. We have become, almost overnight, a nation of twitchers and shamers. Thatrsquos understandable.But letrsquos cut each other some slack. Letrsquos not take this whole thing a twitch too far."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-gorings-country-life-eery-silence-lambs","story":"Had anyone been so sneaky, it would have been a bad move.

But as whisky expert Angus MacRaild was about to find, behind the doors of the impressive property lurked an intoxicating and quite unexpected treasure trove unlike anything he had ever seen before.ldquoI was in the middle of Colorado, several thousand feet above sea level and feeling rather spaced out from jet lag, he recalls.ldquoI was quite discombobulated anyway. But inside this grand house and down the stairs in the basement was a wooden led room ndash a whisky cellar.As he crossed the tartan carpet, his jaw dropped. ldquoThe wooden shelves stretched from the carpet to rafters, specially designed for this whisky collection, he recalls.ldquoNo-one knew about this. It was like a preserved Aladdinrsquos Cave of treasures. It was remarkable.Whisky expert MacRaild had been dispatched to the high plains of Colorado to check out a collection of malt whiskies gathered by a very private enthusiast.What he found was a real-le whisky galore.On each shelf was crammed bottle after bottle of single malt whisky rarities. A  Macallan Fine and Rare -year-old worth an eye-watering pound million, bottle after bottle of  Black Bowmore ndash each one estimated at pound, ndash a Glenfiddich  Rare Collection , one of just  bottles ever produced, and dozens of highly sought-after bottles from lost distilleries: Dallas Dhu, Glenugie, Killyloch, some almost a century old.Still reeling from encountering one of the worldrsquos most stunning and secret collections of single malt whisky, MacRaild spotted something  that would make his heart sing.ldquoAt the back was a typical pub wood bar with a gantry and a wee sink. It was jammed full of bottles.ldquoIt was ridiculous, he laughs. ldquoThere would be a fairly standard bottle of whisky that would cost maybe  or  sitting next to a bottle that was worth ,.ldquoThat was his drinking stock, stuffed behind the bar, ready to be drunk.ldquoThat told me this collector was first and foremost a drinker who loved the social aspect of Scotch whisky.It seemed Gooding ndash who had been raised surrounded by soft drinks bottles so could be forgiven for enjoying the clink of a glass bottle against a tumbler ndash wasnrsquot collecting because he wanted to make a buck. Rather, this was a man who quite simply adored a decent dram.In the coming week, Perthshire-based Whisky Auctioneer will carry out the second part of its sale of Richard Goodingrsquos single malt whiskies ndash named ldquoThe Perfect Collection.The first, in February, saw more than , malts from the collection attract , bidders from  countries. Highlights included a rare Macallan  Valerio Adami -year-old which alone sold for a record-breaking pound,.It raised more than pound million.The second instalment of the collection consisting of almost , bottles went on sale on Friday and will continue for a further eight days. It is expected to achieve a similar sum.Part of the collectionrsquos charm, says MacRaild, is it eccentricity, quality and the fact that no-one knew it was there.ldquoIt was collected before whisky collecting took off as a global phenomenon,\" he says. \"It was an age of innocence when collecting whisky was a niche thing.ldquoThe internet came and changed the face of what was just a hobby.Born in Denverrsquos wealthy Belcaro neighbourhood in , Richard Goodings financial clout to lavish cash on fine whisky was never a problem.His grandfather, James A Gooding, launched the Pepsi Cola Bottling Company of Denver in , supplying bottles of soft drink across Colorado and parts of surrounding states.After his father retired, Gooding took over as owner and chief executive officer. However, his tenure only lasted from  to  when, aged , he decided to sell the company back to the parent corporation.The move brought him a fortune ndash his wealth was rumoured to be in the region of  million.And what better way to celebrate than with a dram or two However, nipping to his local Walmart was not going to bring Richard Gooding the liquid treasures he sought.His personal pilot, a silver-haired chap called Kirk with a bushy white moustache, recalls frequent jaunts across the Atlantic with Gooding in search of single malt whiskies.Speaking in a video produced for the Perthshire company organising the sale of Goodingrsquos collection, Whisky Auctioneers, he offers a fascinating insight into the lestyle that money can bring.ldquoWe went to Ireland, Scotland,  or  trips specically for auctions for purchasing whisky, he says.ldquoWe pulled up to Talisker and just knocked on the door.

The firm contracted blends from Bulloch Lade, but also produced its own label called Red Monogram.It regularly received fillings of Glenlivet and Ardbeg for its production, and in earlier years, sought-after Longmorn malt as well. These casks would occasionally be bottled as single malts for the companys more discerning customers, as was the case here. Its Glenlivet was often pre-vatted for blending purposes, so bottled as a single malt here with an undiscernible vintage or age statement. This was bottled at some point in the early s.The early reverence for this now iconic Speyside distillery is clear in the wax dipping of these bottle tops, a practice the firm usually reserved for its high-end vintage port.Glenfiddich  Peter J RussellGlenfiddich was an early advocate of the single malt Scotch category, and its faith is rewarded today by being one of the best-selling Scotch brands in the world. It became the first distillery to market its single malt brand in , and was the first to open its facility to visitors. Glenfiddich was an important trailblazer in the whisky industry, whose contribution cannot be forgotten. The scale of its operation today is a testament to this.This is a spectacular example of one of the distillerys early single malts, bottled here especially for Peter J Russell  Co in Edinburgh.Pre-war vintages in single malt are exceptionally rare, particularly from distilleries like Glenfiddich.

We all have habits that we perform every single day, we make cups of tea, we brush our teeth, we have a glass of water. What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form. We can do this using body awareness like I mentioned earlier but it can also be useful to video ourselves doing these exercises, to seewe can spot any issues.So there you have it, three things to keep in mind when doing these exercises:Use old habits to create new habits these exercises are an opportunity to practice movement form takes time and practice to develop.* Shops across Scotland are closing.

The internet means access to sophisticated online archives is only a mouse click away and there are scores of websites offering advice to those hoping to discover their inner Sherlock Holmes.It all makes genealogy ndash and historical research more generally ndash ideal for locked-down Scots seeking mental stimulation at home.The premises of institutions such as the National Library and National Records of Scotland might be shut but thatrsquos no barrier when information can be obtained instantly and from anywhere. Even more importantly, much of it is free.Researching your family treeThere has over the last two decades been an explosion in the range and richness of online content available to those looking to find out more about their ancestors. Public interest in family history has grown just as rapidly.The ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh , part of the National Records of Scotland, provides online access to births, marriages and deaths, as well as wills, census documents, Coats of Arms and valuation rolls.Fees are charged for viewing some items but, explains Iain Ferguson, Centre Manager, the entire operation has been designed to maximise speed and ease of use.ldquoInstead of the olden days when you had to come in, we now have digitised museum records, he says. ldquoYou just type in a name and year, and the system can search for it in an instant. And you have the opportunity to look up images of records.Of course, the online quest to trace a family tree doesnrsquot have to be limited to big national organisations.Independent websites can also offer a vital helping hand. FindMyPast , one of the largest and best known, gives armchair genealogists access to billions of records and its archive is expanding all the time. Late last year, it announced a new online collection spanning nearly five centuries of Dundee and Angus history. The materials provide names, dates, residences and occupations, as well as photographic documents of streets and people. Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace. These are things wersquore not currently able to do, but we wanted to do something to support parents and keep their children learning about history.Sidebar ndash top tips for the budding genealogist Start with what you know. Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back.

Normally, this would have looked like playing catch up on Ridgersquos part, but arguably this was a more fitting time to have the MP for Holborn and St Pancras on. As Ridge said in her introduction: ldquoThe UK government is dealing with an unprecedented challenge, but as deaths here rise at a faster rate than in other countries, serious questions are now being asked about the speed of the UK response and what still needs to be done.: What is driving surge in deaths Ridge initially put some of those questions to Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary. In interviewing style, the Sky News presenter prefers a quietly persistent approach to anything more showy. She gets results, or at least tries to, because she listens to the answers and adapts her questioning accordingly.It is an approach you might think was standard, but anyone watching the daily press conference from Downing Street will know that is far from the case. In too many instances, the same questions are asked in similar ways, often to little effect.Whatever Ridge asked, Mr Sharma, in common with every other Minister since the crisis began, held to the line that the government had been following, and would continue to be guided by, scientic advice.So on to Sir Keir, standing outside his home in north London. He had been in the Sunday papers calling for parliament to be recalled after Easter so ldquoserious questions ndashthose again ndash could be asked of the government.As for Ridgersquos questions, he was not keen on saying anything that would look like an attack on the government.ldquoOf course there will be questions in due course about what happened when, but the most important thing is we have that unity of purpose which is to try to get those figures down, he said, referring to the recent death tolls.ldquoWe will support the government in that, we will ask challenging questions, dficult questions about where we go next, about whatrsquos happened in the past, but I think the whole nation desperately wants those figures to go down.: Boris Johnson discharged from hospitalRidge tried again. Was the government too slow to act  Same answer: now is not the time.He did want to know, however, about the governmentrsquos strategy in the months to come. He also had some ideas about how the Commons could operate at a time of social distancing. Having hundreds of MPs together in one place was clearly not an option.ldquoIn New Zealand, they have set up a special select committee to look at coronavirus. It is chaired by the leader of the opposition and it operates on a daily basis using technology so people can see parliament at work.One of the matters such a committee would look at was the ldquomismatch between the government saying there was enough personal protection equipment to go around, and staff reporting shortages. This, he went on, was the kind of ldquoconstructive opposition he had in mind.ldquoI want the government to get this right, I want to support the government to get this right, but we need to point out the dference between what they are saying and the position on the front line so that it can be fixed.On Marr, Lisa Nandy, who had challenged Sir Keir for the Labour leadership, largely walked in step with her new boss. She went further, however, in saying there had been areas where action had not been taken quickly enough, and that was due, in part, to the country being in a ldquoweakened state.ldquoWe should never again be in a position where our public services donrsquot have the resilience they need to respond, where families are only one step away from financial collapse, where workers are struggling to get the rights and protection they need, she said.: Iain Macwhirter on the crisisAll of which sounded highly political.

Unlike in England which limits the number of dogs which can be used to just two, there is no limit to numbers in Scotland.According to anti-bloodsport campaigners, a lack of clarity in the law has opened the door to the risk of hunts continuing to use packs of dogs, raising concerns that foxhunting with hounds is continuing in all but name.Police Scotland has also previously suggested that the law banning fox hunting in Scotland is unworkable and creates a level of confusion which can deflect from the spirit of the law.Moves to strengthen the law which were to be included in forthcoming Scottish Parliament business have now been put on hold as a result of the current health crisis.Campaigners are now calling for political parties to enshrine a change in foxhunting legislation in their manestos for next yearrsquos Scottish Parliament elections.The League Against Cruel Sports say they filmed incidents at the JedForest hunt at Jedburgh and the Duke of Buccleuch hunt near Eccles in the Scottish Borders.Footage captured on  December during the JedForest hunt appears to show a pack of hounds on the scent of a fox. The charity says it believes the JedForest Hunt was encouraging its hounds to search for and chase foxes.Steven Irvine, Police Scotland Wildle and Enviromental Crime Officer said: ldquoOn Tuesday,  December, , a complaint was made to police about a fox hunt in the Jedburgh area. Our enquiries are continuing into this matter.In the second film also involving the JedForest hunt on March  this year, a fox is seen bolting after it was dug out from underground. The hunt then attempts a gunshot before the pack of hounds chases down the fox.In the final clip, a huntsman from the Buccleuch hunt is seen throwing a dead fox into a pack of hounds near Eccles in the Scottish Borders. The incident took place during the hunt on March .In both cases, the films were shared with police however, no crime was established in either case.Robbie Marsland, Director of the League Against Cruel Sports, Scotland said: ldquoWe believe the law does not work. For the last five years we have been filming Scottish hunts and looking for patterns of behaviour.ldquoThey say they are shooting foxes, but in the first year we didnrsquot see a single gun. When they knew we were filming them, guns started to appear.They would be held up in an ostentatious manner.ldquoEvery hunt we saw looked to us like a tradition hunt looked before the ban except occasionally a man would be standing there with a gun.ldquoHunts often come up with a way of protecting themselves and for the police to say they donrsquot think itrsquos possible for a prosecution.Campaigners want new legislation which would reduce the number of dogs used during a hunt to just two, and a clause that would outlaw the practice of laying a fox scent for hounds to follow ndash known as trail hunting. Popular in England, there are concerns that it can lead to hounds confusing scent baits with live animals.Countryside Alliance Director Jamie Stewart criticised the campaignersrsquo methods and insisted hunts in Scotland were abiding by the law.ldquoOnce again the LACs have reverted to the deceitful practice of hiding in bushes and using heavily edited footage to suggest illegal practices in an attempt to deceive the general public and to try and influence politicians.He added: ldquoScottish Mounted Fox hound packs operate a legal pest control service to comply with the Protection of Wild MammalsAct .ldquoThe impact of fox predation on livestock, red-listed, and other vulnerable, ground-nesting birds is well-documented.ldquoIn addition to this, scientic research tells us that foxes could be responsible for the savage death of up to , lambs in Scotland every year.

Indeed, some estimates suggest the extra shared cost for the UK could be around pound trillion, which would increase the national debt by  per cent.Basically, this means that there has been a signicant \"material change\" in Scotlands financial position since the last SNP conference when all sorts of fancul promises were made about establishing our own currency and so on. Compounding the problem for an independent Scotland has been the crash in oil prices, which at the current level would produce little or no tax revenues. Furthermore, there are serious isions opening up in the EU with key politicians in Italy and Spain calling for \"common debt\" , otherwise the \"very existence\" of the EU would be at stake.Taking the above into consideration there are now no credible commentators left who believe there is the slightest chance that Scotland could leave the UK or that it would be in our interests to join a ided EU. Perhaps it is now time for Ms Sturgeon to be honest with her followers and explain that there has indeed been a \"material change\", but this time it means they need to accept the cost of leaving the UK is too great for at least a \"generation\" or more to come.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.I FOUND much to agree with in Doug Maughan and Iain Millars lettersabout Labour and its new leadership. In fact,when I read Neil Findlays letterI started to write a reply which began \"Well, thatdidnt last long\".It showed the enormity ndash impossibility, Im beginning to think ndash of the task, and the stupidity and pigheadedness of the people Jackie Bailie, Ian Murray and Sir Keir Starmer are up against.Ive spoken to many Labour supporters, including an MSP, whose needles are stuck in the groove that the SNP wedged them into, marked \"you lost in Scotland because you sided with the Tories in \".No they didnt, they squandered the huge thanks and goodwill of two million No voters by failing to unite in their opposition to Indyref and come up with the leadership and policies to win any of the subsequent elections indeed, as Mr Millar quotes, democratically \"ridding Scotland\" of its SNP Government.And now this capitulation into federalism or more devolution appeasement, an unworkable approachthat was theme of a frustrating speech by Gordon Brown, one of my heroes of , at the recent These Island conference.For all the economic, social, security, Covid, and Brexit reasons that are regularly aired in these columns I disagree with the conclusion that independence is the answer. In fact, Im one of a growing number who think devolution has failed and should be morphed into something more agile and effective.Reduce the bloated  MP and MSP count to  talented MPs, boost the Scottish Offices power in Westminster and power in Scotland by having ministers in political charge of the main devolved departments and a civil service immune to the bullying and patronage that seems to have infected Holyrood.And get behind Andy Burnhams City Region vision that is working so well in Manchester.I have heard it explained at These Islands and a conference run by Aberdeen City and Shire, whose administrations, frustrated by SNP centralised, back the idea.Scottish Labour leaders could do worse than pay a visit to Aberdeen, see how effectively the joint Labour and Conservative administrations are working, copy their ideas and reverse the bulky, vindictive suspension of its Labour group.There is a long way to go.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.IF the Scottish Labour Party is serious about trying to regain lost ground, and to provide a credible opposition to the SNP, it must get rid of its current ineffectual leader, who has been a complete disaster.

Trying to change your practice in that short timeframe is a challenge, I assure you.We spent those two weeks, hours in front of the computer, planning, implementing and marking work, responding to parent queries and questions and sending videos and messages of support and encouragement to our naturally worried pupils.We are now in our school holidays so naturally this is to be a time for rest and recuperation.

Most of the major pandemics of the last  years began in animal hosts, including the Spanish flu which jumped from birds to humans and HIV, which came from chimps.:Coronavirus in Scotland - Researchers explore impact of virus on bodySince Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was pinpointed as a possible point of origin for coronavirus in late , it has since infected more than a million people across the globe.It has been suggested that pangolins ndash a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater ndash was a staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.But new research suggests bats are no more likely to pass on viruses to humans than other animals.The research, led by scientists at the University of Glasgow reveals that the risk of zoonotic viruses - diseases that spread from animals to infect humans - spreading to people is largely the same across erse groups of animals.The findings published to in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America suggest previous scientic thinking that certain animals pose a heightened risk of spreading viruses to humans may not be correct.The researchers say that the findings cast doubt on the idea that bats produce viruses with a \"heightened propensity\" to infect humans.Dr Daniel Streicker, senior research fellow at the Institute of Bioersity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: \"The recognition that several high-profile viruses originated from bats triggered tremendous interest in whether there was something special about their ecology or immune systems which makes their viruses disproportionately likely to infect humans.\"Our finding that the number of zoonoses that have emerged from bats is about what would be expected for any mammalian group of their size casts doubt on the idea that traits of bats produce viruses with a heightened propensity to infect humans.\"Dr Streicker added:\"To knowthere is anything special about bats, we now need to understand whether the bat viruses that do jump to humans cause more severe disease or spread better among humans than viruses from other animals, which is currently uncertain.\"The study, funded by Wellcome, The Royal Society and The Medical Research Council, found that the likelihood of a virus transmitting from animals to humans does not signicantly dfer across  dferent types of bird and mammal.Instead, scientists now believe that it is the characteristic traits of the viruses, rather than their animal hosts, that will be the more useful in predicting whether the virus will be transferred to humans.Dr Nardus Mollentze, research assistant at the universitys Centre for Virus Research, said: \"Although bats will and should remain a focus for viral reservoir research, as the likely origins of major zoonotic pathogens such as SARS-CoV- and Ebola viruses, our work shows that the proportion and number of zoonotic viruses in bats is not unusual compared to other mammalian groups.\"This means that ongoing efforts to identy potential future threats to human health by screening animals for undiscovered viruses will need to focus on a much wider range species than is currently the case.\"Our study also highlights the need to find new traits of viruses that can help us anticipate their zoonotic potential, since knowledge of the current reservoir was not helpful to predict whether a virus might infect humans - even when the reservoir is closely related to humans.\"A year-and-a-half before the current Covid- pandemic, Dr Streicker led a study that showed that machine learning algorithms could predict the natural host of a virus and might help prevent the spread of disease to humans.Identying the natural virus hosts early - which can help prevent the spread to humans - can take years of intensive field research and laboratory work.Those delays make it dficult to implement preventative measures, such as vaccinating animals or preventing contact between species.But he led a group of scientists that found that a new machine learning algorithm could accelerate this process.An algorithmic model accurately predicted the likely host for a broad spectrum of single-source RNA viruses - the viral group which jumps from animals to humans most often.The researchers were able to train machine learning algorithms to match the patterns within viral genomes to the animal they came from. When a virus jumps from a natural host to a human, it leaves a fingerprint from the animal or insect which can be traced back.Over  viruses were studied, and in over  per cent of cases the model correctly predicted the known natural host of the disease. In  per cent of cases, the tool determined whether or not the virus was transmitted by blood-sucking insects, and the type of insect was predicted correctly about  per cent of the time.The model also revealed new leads. Ebola was also thought to have come from bats, but when the team tested two of the four strains of the disease, they found strong evidence that these strains of the virus could also have originated in primates.The team were developing a web application to allow scientists across the globe to submit their virus sequences and recieve predictions for natural hosts and disease transmission routes within minutes.And late last year Dr Streicker was among a group of scientists who pioneered a new technique to help stop the spread of deadly rabies from infected bats to humans.The group glowing fluorescent gel to estimate the potential effectiveness of spreadable vaccines to control diseases in wild bats in South America.Rabies vaccines given to bats can be transferred from one bat to another - however how widely they were spread was not previously known.The fluorescent gel - called Rhodamine b - was applied to bats in three colonies in Peru, where it acted as a marker to simulate the bat-to-bat spread of an oral rabies vaccine.When the gel was ingested by bats that groomed each other, it led to fluorescence in the bats hair follicles, which was then monitored by fluorescent microscopic analysis of hair samples collected by the scientists.Where common vampire bats routinely feed on human blood, rabies is estimated to cause up to  deaths in eve-ry , people, while losses from livestock mortality exceed pound. million annually, disproportionately affecting impoverished, rural communities."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : amYesterday saw the Orkney Young Farmers annual over-wintering competition go ahead at Orkney Auction Mart # albeit under the strict measures currently in place at the mart.

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-. Land managers should respect access rights, which are particularly important at this dficult time.

also warned that the publicrsquos strong support to stick to the lockdown measures ldquowonrsquot last and the Government needs to find a way to tell the nation about how it will be eased.Professor Linda Bauld, of the University of Edinburgh, said the public was now steeling itself for a continuation of the lockdown, amid an atmosphere where support for the measures remains high, compliance is generally good and concern about the virus is at the forefront of peoplersquos minds.ldquoBut this wonrsquot last, she warned.ldquoThe social, economic and health effects of lockdown are accumulating.ldquoThere will come a tipping point when the cost of the current restrictions outweighs the benefits.She added: ldquoSooner rather than later, government needs to share the possible options with the public and be transparent about the costs and benefits of each, rather than continually evading questions on this, as is currently the case.The Government has also faced criticism over whether more lives could have been savedthe lockdown had been implemented earlier, as the Department for Health said , people had died in hospitals in the UK as of pm on Sunday, with many more expected in care homes.It means the UK has more recorded deaths than any country except the US, Italy, Spain and France.But Mr Raab rejected any ldquolike-for-like comparison with other countries, saying it depended on each nationrsquos inidual circumstances and how far along the coronavirus outbreak curve they were.Meanwhile, questions were also raised about whether the number of coronavirus-related deaths in care homes was being properly recorded.Industry bosses warned daily death tolls are ldquoairbrushing out hundreds of older people who have died in the care system, as the chief medical officer announced that coronavirus outbreaks had been recorded at  care homes in the UK in just  hours.Speaking at the daily press briefing, Professor Chris Whitty said around .% of care

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine. Torquil Mackenzie # a name I will take to my grave!” “I can#t remember how far back it was but it was a while ago — it was a cup final up in Uig against Portree. The game went to extra-time # we had Bruce Neil and Paul Flynn sent off but ended up winning something like -.“I remember John ‘Spod# Macleod scoring a goal and running up the touchline with his hands cupped over his ears to the once noisy Portree support who had given him dogs# abuse during the game. That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

He had reopened his kitchen and was supplying hot meals to the needy and the vulnerable within his reach in north Belfast. I think he had managed  servings each day.The reaction of one local resident while she safely gathered up her evening meal from her doorstep would have melted the hardest heart.We really are in uncharted territory. On Monday my we drove to the undertakers to say a final goodbye to her mum who had passed away last Friday. Angela had to fight back the need to cry as she sat in the chapel of rest on the Upper Newtownards Road. Tears are dangerous now. Tears can let the virus in. When you need to let it all out the most, when you say your last goodbye, you cannot afford to let your guard down.She is so strong, she has been through so much in this last couple of years and her mum would have been justly proud that she had kept it together: but probably never expressed it.For Mary was like that. Mary was no wallflower, but she liked the solace to be gleaned from the deep cover of the foliage within so as to help her unravel the entanglements that le iniably threw in her face. Le in one of the less fortunate neighbourhoods in this city of wonder.Mary first met me in . I had been hiding in a wardrobe in the upstairs bedroom of Angela#s sister#s house in Harrogate Street. We had the run of the place while her sister was on honeymoon.I felt like an extra from Harry#s Game or Cal, a lapsed Protestant emigre on the run in the Wild West, just off the Springfield Road. I held the door of the wardrobe closed with an index finger, my legs akimbo, my head at an angle to avoid the hangers. What loose change I had in my pockets, my lighter and my  Regal all spilled out onto the floorboards as my future mother-in-law chain-smoked in the doorway of the kitchen scullery below.She heard the coins roll into the grooves above and looked at Angela inquisitively, instinctively, but without judgement. She knew rightly.I met her in person not long after. In the years that followed I would visit with her at the neutral venue of Harrogate Street, to help her make lunch and to do the dishes while asking her questions about the Falls Road in the old days.I did this apprenticeship to garner some kind of time served understanding with her. I did it at first because her world was so dferent from my own.I did it because I wanted to know more about her daughter. I soon learned not to ask too much as she would tire of it. I learned that she was one of le#s listeners who had long since made up her mind about what was at fault with the world. She taught me how to love my shortcomings. She never saw the boat being pushed out, but she made a success of bringing up her family in times of hardship and Angela was proof of that on the day of her mother#s funeral.Reflecting on my relationship with Mary over the past few days, I have been struck by the sense of my awkwardness and her stoicism in those formative years when she could have wiped the floor with me. I had #baggage# as we all do we have all lost something.But when I hurtled out of that wardrobe and into her le I didn#t know that I was gaining a confidante as well as a future mum-in-law. The wardrobe was a kind of portal into this hard-bitten woman#s world and the more time I spent in her company, the more I learned about the struggle people have just to make ends meet.She was so dferent from my own mother, and I was close to her as well. My mum dispelled any awkward silences by keeping conversations going, disallowing pregnant pauses with her glass half full optimism. Mary was so dferent. She knew the value of silence. She would walk to Sandy Row to get shoes mended. Walk everywhere and get messages in and try to make the housekeeping last. She was a real fighter.During the turmoil of the past week, I spent a little while looking at the supermoon. My we pointed out Mars, which is tiny but visibly red when viewed with the naked eye and it gave everything a kind of perspective. Venus is nearby, a show-off, glaring like an Army helicopter would do back in the day. This rich assortment fighting for our attention, this eternal backdrop to our lives of limitations.I was brought up in Drumbeg, son of a white collar dad and an auxiliary nurse. I was comfortable and untouched by the Troubles but I knew grief well as I lost a brother in a car crash in  when I was  and he was , a father-of-three. He was a TV producer and destined for good things, we supposed, but fate intervened. My family dealt with that loss by internalising it. I chose to try and seek comfort from the people my brother had circulated among. My education suffered as I skived off school to spend an increasing amount of time with people much older than me who I looked up to. I think I was looking for some kind of vestige of my brother to fill in the gap.In , I was living in a haunted flat around the corner from my old school. It was bleak. I used to wake up early to steal milk deliveries, regularly changing my modus operandi so as not to get caught. Unlike everyone  living in the flat I wasn#t in higher education. I went to every party I heard about and would #minesweep# discarded drinks and cigarettes. At one such gathering in Camden Street I saw Angela. I followed her into every room in the house and finally plucked up the courage to try and engage her in small talk, until after some persuasion I managed to get her to write down her phone number.Angela gave me stability, she gave me some kind of structure and allowed me to open up about my insecurities. She came from Beechmount. Her father was a gardener at Clonard Monastery and her mum, Mary, was a housewe.They were as far away from my world as that tiny red planet I viewed last week. In no way could she stay the night with me at my flat in Eglantine Avenue. Harrogate Street became the focus, our chance to be together. It gave me a real frisson every time I went up the Grosvenor Road and on to the Springfield Road in that era. I was in territory that was alien to me but it was worth it to be with her.I came from a comfortable background and Angela#s mum Mary gave me a free pass.She teased me about my religion, but our labels didn#t matter as we rose above religion somehow.I often think of myself as the harlequin character walking along the beach with the old lady in the Ashes to Ashes video by David Bowie. That#s what me and Mary looked like as we walked around the tight streets off the Falls Road as I helped her gather up messages on a Saturday. The old lady was Bowie#s mum, but I#m sure you knew that.I had Mary as a shield in this alien place where everyone knew her. There were real characters back then one old lady used to sit outside her house with a tame rook on her shoulder. If I am rambling now, forgive me but I am trying through the prism of time and grief and shared experiences to encapsulate my circumstances, unremarkable, but building up to the relationship with my future we and mum-in-law.They really helped me get back on track in the most phlegmatic and strong way. I say strong because these women knew hardship and how to live without and that is what gave them real character. Mary gave us the full measure of love without spilling a drop.We have Mary#s wedding album. I think their marriage was solemnised in . She was  years younger than her husband, Barney. She was quite a catch. The timeline nestles just beyond our grasp, the light from the event still travelling far off into space in the direction of the red planet I saw the other evening. We look for things within the photograph that we can associate with our own era and struggle. We are so acquainted with the technicolour airbrushing and styling of the modern wedding shoot. Beauty is timeless and she had that in spades and she gave it to her children.The image is staged of course, the mood is formal, sombre even, I liken it to Mary#s Prayer, a song by the group Danny Wilson which was in the charts in February  after I first met her. Black and white lends the image a rich patina, an old time resonance that delivers an honest longevity. Her expression looks real and almost unconscious of the lens. This is her at the threshold of everything that would come next into her new le and shape her outlook, her dreams and her features. She never showed me this album. It never occurred to her to recall that a record of the event existed somewhere. It fell into our laps by chance. This was her stock-in-trade, don#t volunteer unless asked and wear a poker smile in the face of adversity. Mary was careworn and time proven, she never rocked the boat because she never left the harbour. Her le experience was written large on her brow, her exasperation with the world never got in the way of a smile.Mary had been in a care home on the Antrim Road for nearly four years and Angela would visit her every Wednesday. We followed Mary#s hearse to the gates of Roselawn just after .pm last Wednesday. The crematorium is closed to the public so we had to double back and observe the hearse as it went ahead up the hill. It was all we could do to follow her on her last dignied journey while the Castlereagh hills undulated and the Mournes nodded their own appreciation. It was not long before another hearse took its place at the entrance gates.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-dc-ab-c-aecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-dc-ab-c-aecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-dc-ab-c-aecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-dc-ab-c-aecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-dc-ab-c-aecfc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandChildren’s hospital in message of hope during pandemicA Belfast hospital for sick children has created a “corridor of hope” during the coronavirus pandemic.,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes Press EyeBy Jenna GardinerApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA financial support package for tourism firms due to go live next Monday may be too late, industry representatives have warned.Announced by Economy Minister Diane Dodds last Friday, the -day wait for the £, grant scheme may prove critical to the loss of many good tourism businesses and thousands of jobs, according to the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance .Firms in hospitality, retail and tourism can apply for the funding on April  with payments due around  days later. The money is intended to help ease cash flow pressures as the sector suffers the catastrophic economic impact of coronavirus.But on what would have been the start of the summer season, businesses have seen their tourism income drop to zero and are desperately trying to keep afloat until the scheme goes live.NITA chief executive Joanne Stuart called for interim payments to tide firms over.We are now pleading with banks and other financial institutions to work with the industry as they wait to submit business critical applications, she said. Jobs are being shed now, cancellations have already happened, businesses are ready to close now. The Assembly needs to make interim payments nowthese businesses and jobs are to survive.Firms are struggling to meet upfront staffing costs as they await the implementation of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, and were relying on the grant scheme to fill the gap in funding.This meant we would have had an interim cash flow that would have plugged the gap until the furlough scheme went live, added Ms Stuart.However, as the grants have not been distributed, businesses may not be able to survive until the end of April much less start making grant applications.In the absence of immediate cash flow relief, the NITA said companies and jobs will be lost ahead of the scheme#s implementation.The tourism industry will be an important part of our economic recovery once we start to see restrictions lted and the impact of the virus receding, it said. We need to ensure tourism businesses survive through these unprecedented circumstances and be in a position to provide a future for staff and deliver for the economy.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

TIME FOR CHANGE Like every media outlet, producing the County Derry Posts sport section has taken a change of direction. It involves more delving and conjuring. Gone are the reports and round-ups from the club league. The athletics, soccer and rugby seasons are on hold. The local cycling clubs have came to a halt. Now it is all about nostalgia. In these testing times, it gives our readers a chance to reflect on the past. We are living in unprecedented times. It takes a bit of readjusting, but sports writers are the lucky ones. We have a mountain of material out there – just begging to be sourced. There are stories waiting to be told. When researching Colum Rocks impact on Loups underage success of the early s, his nephew Ronan handed me a bag of scrapbooks. It was simply unbelievable. I am not from Loup, but it was compelling reading. Newspaper cuttings of match reports, previews and pen-pics. There was even a summary of each season and hopes of the next.

In an interview with teenager Enda Downey, before the postponed MacRory final, he mentioned his Granda and Granny Downeys collection of artefacts, including videos of games and how it gave him a taste of generations past, before he was even born. “We watched onethe other day and it was just catch and kick, it was so dferent to now,” he said of one of the s of videos, all stored away. The media industry has moved on. The newer generation is more au fait with online and getting their fix from social media. Thats the challenge we face, finding that balance. But, the last few weeks have reinforced one thing – there is no substitute for the hard copy. YouTube channels come and go, websites can vanish and hard drives can crash. On the other hand, a well archived set of papers, programmes and magazines is simply invaluable. As the pandemic continues, any glimmer of a date for the resumption of sport is far away over the horizon. When it arrives, we will embrace it like never before.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

Derry are due to play Offaly in the opening game of the Christy Ring Cup on the weekend of May  .The GAA are currently keeping an eye on government on both sides of the border before any decision is made.“When we get an indication from them of when things are likely toto some kind of normality, well then be able to make decisions both on the structure of an inter-county championship and when that would start,” McGill added.It is likely the Super s wont be played and the hurling championship will revert to knock-out.In terms of club activity, McGill said there was no truth in the speculation that club championships are being planned for the months of June and July.“If there is going to be a period when there is going to be a restriction on attendances, then perhaps we may look at a period of club activitybefore the inter-county championships start. But we are staring into the unknown,” concluded McGill, who is part of the senior football management team of his native Bornacoola in Leitrim.On March , Derry CCC informed clubs they would get two or three weeks to prepare for any resumption of activity.“From talking to Stephenand people in other counties, they are all keen to allow a lead-in until any seriousgames,” McGill added.The GAA have a desire to complete rounds six and seven of the inter-county football leagues and the ision two and three finals in hurling to enable the association to get off on a good footing next season.“The bottom line is, no decisions have been taken yet” he concluded. googletag.cmd.push RELATED - Conlan calls for GAA to take a lead.

Derry are due to play Offaly in the opening game of the Christy Ring Cup on the weekend of May  .The GAA are currently keeping an eye on government on both sides of the border before any decision is made.“When we get an indication from them of when things are likely toto some kind of normality, well then be able to make decisions both on the structure of an inter-county championship and when that would start,” McGill added.It is likely the Super s wont be played and the hurling championship will revert to knock-out.In terms of club activity, McGill said there was no truth in the speculation that club championships are being planned for the months of June and July.“If there is going to be a period when there is going to be a restriction on attendances, then perhaps we may look at a period of club activitybefore the inter-county championships start. But we are staring into the unknown,” concluded McGill, who is part of the senior football management team of his native Bornacoola in Leitrim.On March , Derry CCC informed clubs they would get two or three weeks to prepare for any resumption of activity.“From talking to Stephenand people in other counties, they are all keen to allow a lead-in until any seriousgames,” McGill added.The GAA have a desire to complete rounds six and seven of the inter-county football leagues and the ision two and three finals in hurling to enable the association to get off on a good footing next season.“The bottom line is, no decisions have been taken yet” he concluded. googletag.cmd.push RELATED - Conlan calls for GAA to take a lead.

I went off to my daughter’s school and got everything sorted out and then came out home. “I thought we’d all go to the beach a run and walk the dogs to get away from the chaos for an hour, but I wasn’t in the house ten minutes until the police landed.” Maggie immediately realised her mistake when the police officers appeared, and they accompanied her back to Tesco so she could pay her bill. googletag.cmd.push However, once she had paid the outstanding amount at the Customer Service Desk, she was waved over by the store’s security guard. She said: “The security man was talking to what turned out to be a manager and he waved me over.

He said he would need my name, address and date of birth. I said I’d already given that to the police. “I explained that I wanted to come in and recty it and that the police were sitting outsideneeded, but he handed me a Notice of Intended Civil Recovery.” The notice explained that Tesco’s solicitors could write to Maggie to recover the costs of investigating the incident, and there was further punishment in store. “They said I was barred for a year. I asked how I was meant to get my pound-a-week shop and he said I’d have to get somebody  to do it for me. “They would only say that it was Tesco’s policy. I was gobsmacked. It was pound.. The day before I’d spent pound and the day before that I’d spent pound. “It was all kept in the public eye, they didn’t take me into a room or anything. I didn’t care though, because I was doing the right thing. “Where is their compassion, their humanity  Especially at a time like this. I came back to fix this, and they treated me like a criminal.” The County Derry Post contacted Tesco for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

Bishop McKeown visited the cemetery at dawn to sprinkle graves using Easter Water that was blessed in St Eugene’s Cathedral during the Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday night. The visit was arranged in co-operation with Derry City and Strabane District Council. Bishop McKeown said he hoped the Easter Blessing would bring some comfort to grieving families across the Derry Diocese who are unable to visit the graves of their loved ones. He said he was very aware that the government legislation that forced all cemeteries and burial grounds to close for visitors, was a dficult one for many people, but he urged the public to be mindful of their own health and welfare and to take heed of the government advice to Stay at Home. googletag.cmd.push He urged people to have faith and to remember their loved ones through prayer and reflection and encouraged the public to care for one another during this dficult time. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab. For crews that operate as one driver and two loaders, the loaders are transported behind the collection lorry in a support vehicle.ldquoLoaders are also asked to limit their time in cabs to an absolute minimum and can be collected and drop-off points along designated routes.Cllr Casey said the local authority is constantly reviewing its services in light of ldquorapidly changing events and may make further changes at very short notice.He said the current situation remains challenging and is dependent on the ongoing impact of COVID- on council employees.The chairman continued: ldquoWe would like to thank all our frontline workers who continue to engage with our residents to deliver essential services.ldquoI fully appreciate the disruption this has had on normal working routines. However, as a workforce and a wider-society we are now having to make signicant changes to our daily lives. I would also like to thank the public for their support and patience during very dficult circumstances.:Cllr Casey added: ldquoWith our household recycling centres now closed to free up resources needed to maintain domestic refuse collection services and help ensure compliance with social distancing guidance, we are appealing to people not to fly-tip and to do their bit to keep the district clean and safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 County.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre to be community hub  ","story":"DOWN Leisure Centre has been transformed into a new community co-ordination hub to ensure that vulnerable residents across the district receive essential supplies.Set up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the Downpatrick hub is one of three that have been established across the local authority areas.Others have opened in Kilkeel and Newry but the distribution centres are not open to members of the public or community groups.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub which is to play a key role in delivering the service on the ground.Down Leisure Centre mdash which has been closed to the public for the past month as a result of global pandemic mdash has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff will be redeployed to work across all sites and work alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff training is currently underway for those who will be working in split shts at the centres while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The service was formally launched on Monday across the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas, with deliveries expected to centre on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation. Volunteers also signpost those who need further support to other agencies.Good Morningrsquos Down service has never been more important. One of the charityrsquos volunteers, Aidan Harris, says the current climate represents a challenge for everyone, particularly those who live alone.ldquoThe staff moved out of our base at the business park over two weeks ago, but we are providing the service from our own homes and what we are doing is very much appreciated by those we contact every week, he explained.ldquoWe certainly are living in unprecedented times none of us have ever experienced anything like this in our letimes and hopefully will never do again.Aidan explained that while a lot of information people need to hear is circulated via social media, many elderly people do not have access to it. In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17333834.the-buzz-of-the-farmers-mart/resources/images/11256167.jpg","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...However, the statement implied that Sinn Fein’s objection was on procedural grounds rather than because in principle it opposed any Army role. Ms O’Neill said that “we will not rule out any measure necessary to save lives” but added that Mr Swann “has a responsibility to exhaust all options, including the use of other blue light public services and civilian contractors, to ensure that ventilators and le saving equipment are moved swtly to where they are needed most”.In an interview with RTE on Saturday, Ms O’Neill said “we have to do everything necessary to save lives”, but then went on to say: “I don’t believe that British Army assistance is necessary at this point. I believe that all of our modelling indicates that we are coping, albeit in the most challenging of circumstances.”Three weeks ago in the Assembly Mr Swann said that his focus was on saving as many lives as possible and he would accept help from wherever it could be found.He told MLAs: “I’ll use whatever tool I have at my disposal to tackle this virus. If the Irish Army want to come up and help us too when they’ve it sorted down there, I’d be more than happy to welcome them.”DUP Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots said that Sinn Fein was not actually trying to stop the Army being involved, but accused it of a “silly PR stunt”.In a Facebook post on Saturday, Mr Poots said: “Michelle O’Neill would be better seeking a meeting with the republicans in her own constituency who entirely ignore social distancing than engaging in silly PR stunts about something she in reality has no intention of trying to stop.“Robin has my support in doing whatever needs done, however it is done, by whomever it is done.”With the exception of Sinn Fein, every other Executive party publicly endorsed Mr Swann’s attempt to secure support from the military in the battle against the pandemic.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said on Saturday: “Fteen people died of coronavirus overnight in the North. I’ll support anything that gets PPE and ventilators to where it needs to go. Let’s stop playing politics and do whatever it takes to save lives.”Responding to Mr Eastwood’s comments on Twitter, Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “Could not agree more. Robin Swann has my and the Alliance Party’s full support for taking extraordinary measures to try to save people’s lives. All and any help is welcome at this critical time.”First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “Northern Ireland has been working together on tackling this awful disease. We need to keep at it.“When your loved one is lying in hospital, who built the ward will be the last thought on their mind. Let’s build the capacity we need. We fully support the Army being used to build necessary beds.”Ulster Unionist MLA and Royal Irish Regiment reservist Doug Beattie said that Sinn Fein’s rejection of help from the Army was “becoming absolutely tiresome”. He highlighted that the military had in recent weeks already been used by Stormont to create a temporary morgue, without objection from republicans.He added: “I guess few will complainpersonal protection equipment or ventilators are supplied via a military driver or a civilian driver orthe doctor and nurse treating them is military or not.”As in most countries battling the pandemic, the Army has been increasingly involved in the effort to assist health staff as they have become stretched.At the weekend the Ministry of Defence said that nearly  members of the armed forces are being loaned to NHS ambulance services to support their work.Personnel from all three strands of the armed forces will be sent to work at five ambulance trusts.Although their responsibilities will y depending on the area, the new duties will include driving ambulances and taking calls from the public.Eighty service personnel will be sent to the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust where they will drive emergency response vehicles, larger ambulances and work at the response centre which covers five counties around London.In London,  medical personnel from the armed forces will form  critical care transfer teams to transport patients who need to be moved between intensive care units.Engineers from the Army are also supporting the London Ambulance Service to maintain suction units used in ambulances.In Wales,  soldiers finished their two-day ambulance training at the Sennybridge Training Camp near Brecon on April , ready to be deployed across Wales to assist paramedics with non-clinical tasks.Thirty-seven military personnel have been deployed to the East of England Ambulance Service, which covers six counties including Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire, to assist with tasks including driving and logistics.The group all volunteer as emergency responders in their free time and have previously trained with the service.Members of the RAF are already assisting the Scottish Ambulance Service with a trial of a medical isolation and transport system, using RAF Puma helicopters to take critically ill people to hospital.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Our armed forces always step forward at the appearance of threats to the country and its people.“Across the United Kingdom, soldiers, sailors, airmen and women have got the backs of our NHS colleagues as they confront coronavirus.”Members of the armed forces have helped with the response to the outbreak in a iety of other ways.Military personnel were involved in the planning and building of the first NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel exhibition centre in east London, as well as its equivalents across the country.Armed forces personnel made up of  drivers and  driver’s mates have also been trained to fill and transport oxygen tankers to NHS facilities.The Ministry of Defence said there are hundreds of personnel delivering supplies of PPE for the NHS based at distribution centres across the country, amid reported shortages of the vital equipment.Speaking on Friday night, Mr Swann told this newspaper that he hoped the military request would not be isive, repeating his view that the only thing that will ide people in this pandemic is whether they live or die.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital

These communications are ongoing.“Prospective PPE supply routes from China for Northern Ireland have not been finalised.

Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

relax coronavirus lockdown rules","story":"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab showed some cautious optimism as he revealed the latest data suggested the UK was ldquostarting to win this struggle, three weeks after restrictions were imposed.But he insisted the virus was not yet past its peak and that it was ldquofar too early to talk about relaxing the measures, with reports suggesting the lockdown will be extended for at least another three weeks.Speaking at Mondayrsquos Downing Street press conference, he praised the public for staying at home over the Easter weekend, and added: ldquoOur plan is working.ldquoPlease stick with it, and wersquoll get through this crisis together.Details of how the lockdown will eventually be lted remain unclear, however, with the Government repeatedly refusing to outline its ldquoexit strategy.Scientists advising the Government are expected to meet this week to review the latest figures, but Mr Raab insisted it was crucial that ldquowe do not take our eye off the ball with regards to social distancing.It came as the World Health Organisation said restrictions should be lted slowly and not ldquoall at once to avoid a resurgence of the virus, and onlyappropriate measures are in place, including ldquosignicant capacity for contact tracing. vw,vw,px, px\"A near empty Broadstairs beach during the sunny Easter bank holiday weekend But experts have also warned that the publicrsquos strong support to stick to the lockdown measures ldquowonrsquot last and the Government needs to find a way to tell the nation about how it will be eased.Professor Linda Bauld, of the University of Edinburgh, said the public was now steeling itself for a continuation of the lockdown, amid an atmosphere where support for the measures remains high, compliance is generally good and concern about the virus is at the forefront of peoplersquos minds.ldquoBut this wonrsquot last, she warned.ldquoThe social, economic and health effects of lockdown are accumulating.ldquoThere will come a tipping point when the cost of the current restrictions outweighs the benefits.She added: ldquoSooner rather than later, government needs to share the possible options with the public and be transparent about the costs and benefits of each, rather than continually evading questions on this, as is currently the case.The Government has also faced criticism over whether more lives could have been savedthe lockdown had been implemented earlier, as the Department for Health said , people had died in hospitals in the UK as of pm on Sunday, with many more expected in care homes.It means the UK has more recorded deaths than any country except the US, Italy, Spain and France.But Mr Raab rejected any ldquolike-for-like comparison with other countries, saying it depended on each nationrsquos inidual circumstances and how far along the coronavirus outbreak curve they were.Meanwhile, questions were also raised about whether the number of coronavirus-related deaths in care homes was being properly recorded.Industry bosses warned daily death tolls are ldquoairbrushing out hundreds of older people who have died in the care system, as the chief medical officer announced that coronavirus outbreaks had been recorded at  care homes in the UK in just  hours.Speaking at the daily press briefing, Professor Chris Whitty said around .% of care homes in the UK have registered an outbreak, and said he would like Covid- testing to be increased in care homes.The Government also continues to face pressure over shortages of personal protective equipmentfor frontline NHS staff, as a growing number of health workers died.According to , the UK missed three chances to be part of an EU scheme to bulk buy personal protective equipmentfor health workers, with European medical staff set to receive the first of pound. billion-worth of PPE within days or a maximum of two weeks under the scheme.In other developments on Monday:ndash Mr Johnson continued his recovery from Covid- at Chequers in Buckinghamshire after doctors ordered the Prime Minister to rest.ndash Spain, which on Sunday reported its lowest daily growth in infections for three weeks, allowed workers in some non-essential industries toto factories and construction sites on Monday.ndash French President Emmanuel Macron announced the extension of Francersquos strict lockdown until May , on his third televised address to the nation on the virus crisis from the Elysee palace.ndash Italy recorded its lowest daily virus death toll in three weeks at , putting its total deaths at more than ,.In his address, Mr Macron acknowledged ldquofailures and deficiencies in a reference to the lack of masks and other equipment.As a response to the criticism that the country has not
