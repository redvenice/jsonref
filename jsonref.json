This was around 2 or 3am. \u0027They were putting their hands round each other a bit. It certainly seemed more than a bit of interaction with a fan who had come up to him.\u0027She was leaning into him and whispering stuff in his ear and he had his arms around her waist from behind at one point.\u0027They were together for more than an hour and danced a little bit although they didn\u0027t go on to the dance floor.\u0027          Rooney will return to England as player coach at Derby County in January.

The source added: \u0027They had fun but nothing inappropriate happened.\u0027In the early hours, the players went back to the team hotel, the 34-floor Hyatt Regency, where Rooney was seen with a male friend and the woman before the friend left and they headed towards the lift.An onlooker said: \u0027Wayne was laughing and joking with this girl, who was attractive and had tattoos on her arm.

Rooney will wear number 32 as part of the deal, which will see him earn £7.8million over 18 months.MPs and the Church of England were among those condemning the link up with the online bookmakers. Rooney himself has admitted gambling away thousands of pounds as a player.A source said of the latest pictures: \u0027This will embarrass Wayne because the Derby manager Phillip Cocu wants him to be a responsible mentor to the players, keeping them out of trouble.\u0027Part of his job will be to encourage them to behave the right way, not stay out late in clubs and bars.\u0027Coleen Rooney ditches wedding ring on shopping trip after husband Wayne is snapped with mystery brunetteFurious Coleen Rooney warns Wayne her brother will babysit him in the US unless he returns to Britain immediately – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Ed Sheeran rakes 775M closes massive world tour","story":"Share this article His ticket prices are also among the most reasonable in pop and rock.The singer charges an average $86.75 for tickets, which was the lowest of any act in recent years.Sheeran insisted on no VIP ticketing and an aggressive campaign against the secondary market.It was priced 14.2 percent lower than U2\u0027s $101.15 average for its 360 Tour.The Divide Tour\u0027s final show tally is forecasted at 255 shows, while U2 achieved their cash from 110 shows running from June 30, 2009 to July 30, 2011.The Guinness World Record books has Sheeran down for achieving the highest attendance for a music tour, highest-grossing music tour by a solo artist and highest-grossing music tour.The full financial breakdown can be found at https:www.pollstar.comSince its founding in 1981, Pollstar has been the only trade publication dedicated to covering the worldwide concert industry.Pollstar data is the leading resource for the touring industry encompassing box office numbers, routing and directories.Pollstar produces a weekly print magazine, publishes daily content to Pollstar.com and its \u0027Daily Pulse\u0027 e-newsletter, and executes the world\u0027s largest gathering of live music industry professionals - Pollstar Live! - which in 2019 celebrated its 30th anniversary. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/18/4CB548A700000578-0-image-m-27_1527527008815.jpg","title":"Actress Paz La Huertas new suit against Harvey Weinstein adds Disney Miramax","story":"Share this articlePaz de la Huerta Adds Bob Iger, Michael Eisner to Harvey Weinstein Lawsuit | Hollywood Reporter"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markle swap jet set lifestyle 15 pub roast dinner","story":"Share this articlePrince Harry and Meghan Markle tuck into £15 roast dinner at traditional village pub – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Customer tweets help locked WHSmith hour closing","story":"Share this article One replied simply: \u0027Read a book whilst you wait\u0027, alongside laughing and crying emojis. Other followers suggested she \u0027help herself to some Cadbury\u0027s\u0027, play a boardgame and \u0027remain stationary\u0027 to avoid triggering motion sensors.               Rather than help her out of her predicament, friends and followers instead suggested how to pass the time by \u0027reading a book\u0027One said: \u0027I\u0027d start snacking at the tills, always offering a bar of chocolate with your purchase - even if you\u0027re buying chocolate.\u0027Another wrote: \u0027Its only reasonable to help yourself to water and a massive bar of Oreo Dairy Milk\u0027, before someone added: \u0027You can pay the £53.79 in the morning.\u0027The customer called security staff for help and a guard waited outside the shop. She was eventually released by a staff member who came from another branch in Oxford. A WHSmith spokesperson said: \u0027We sincerely apologise to this customer.

But its projects in Yorkshire, the East Midlands and Cheshire have been cast in doubt after all three regions rejected its applications.Ratcliffe has railed against the government’s “unworkable” earthquake rules, which force fracking to stop for 18 hours if the work triggers a tremor which registers higher than 0.5 on the Richter scale.He accused ministers of “playing politics with the future of the country” by implementing a planning system which is “archaic, glacially slow, inordinately expensive and virtually unworkable”.He has also said Holyrood’s decision to rule out fracking in Scotland “beggars belief”.Progress at Ratcliffe’s sites in England have also stalled. Earlier this summer Ineos launched an appeal against Rotheram council after it twice turned down applications to test for shale on a site at Woodsetts. Ineos heard last month that the decision will be postponed until 2020.Ratcliffe vowed in late 2014 to become the UK’s biggest shale player by investing $1bn in developing new shale projects in Scotland and the north of England.Ratcliffe, a Brexit supporter, moved to the tax haven of Monaco last summer just months after he was knighted by the Queen for services to business and investment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2257f290748139bf807967847b7f8313b78d6c38/263_0_5394_3237/master/5394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003afb5439c4176b23cc4e171760914c","title":"highschoolers phones yondr distraction","story":"Soon more than 1,000 schools nationwide will be using Yondr, a pouch that students lock their phones in during classPut your cellphone away. Stop texting. Stop using the camera as a mirror. Stop looking at Instagram. They’re the familiar commands of teachers and educators in the age of the smartphone.Most schools have put in place policies banning or regulating phone usage during school hours, and teachers now routinely find themselves confiscating devices or writing up students for being on their phones.Educators are now exploring more drastic measures. This school year, more than 1,000 schools nationwide will be using Yondr, a pouch system that allows students to lock away their phones while they’re in class. Each morning when students arrive at school, they magnetically lock their devices into their own personal green and gray pouches. They maintain possession of their pouches and devices, but they cannot unlock it until the end of the day, when they tap it on an unlocking magnet station located throughout the school.The concept is not new. Musicians and performers have been using Yondr to prevent people from filming their gigs since the San Francisco-based company launched in 2014. But in recent years, more and more schools have begun using the pouches to keep kids off their phones during school hours, with dozens in the Bay Area alone. “Demand has tripled this year,” the Yondr spokeswoman Kelly Taylor said.Allison Silvestri, the former principal of San Lorenzo high school east of San Francisco, implemented the tool three years ago. The results “were tremendous”, she said. The students were paying attention more in class. The school saw a decrease in referrals for defiance and disrespect. “It was just so powerful to hear students interacting with each other and interacting with adults on campus,” she said.Edward Huang, 16, was part of a pilot program that tested Yondr at San Mateo high school before launching it this school year. He has mixed feelings about Yondr. He’s noticed a difference in his peers. “People aren’t distracted,” he said. “Even people who were on their phones in minor ways, like checking the time and checking notifications, those minor ways add up and have an effect on how engaged you are. Socially, it has improved us. Even if it’s all of us talking about how much we hate it, having something to hate is a conversation topic.”But he’s already heard about issues some kids have had because they couldn’t check their phones. Employers have tried to get in touch with students during the day, and couldn’t.Students have also figured out ways to hack the pouch. A few days ago, someone started an Instagram account that showcased ways to break the Yondr, said Audrey Morganstern, a 16-year-old junior at San Mateo high school. “There was footage of them breaking the pin in the Yondr that controls the bag’s magnet” she said. Morganstern is a fan, however, likening Yondr to “training wheels for people that want to get off their phone”.“There are some people that I might not have been as close to that I’ve had some pretty cool conversations with because before I might have had my phone as a crutch to avoid awkward situations,” she said. Leadership high school in San Francisco started using Yondr this year, but allows students the opportunity to unlock their pouches at lunchtime, said Beth Silbergeld, the school’s principal. She liked the concept of Yondr because the responsibility for the phones remained on the students. “We are not in education to confiscate and manage property,” she said. “Even some schools that use a system that checks the phones into a box, it becomes a huge responsibility for the teachers.”Some teachers have struggled to implement Yondr, just as some students have struggled to adhere by it and have found ways to hack the magnet lock, Silbergeld said.“Our sophomores believe (this program) is because of them,” she said. “They say, ‘We were so bad so you did this.’ But this was a decade of noticing that something wasn’t working and the efforts we were making of asking students to put their phones away and taking some of their phones away weren’t working.”At Berkeley high school, the freshman class is trying a Yondr pilot program this year, but the rest of the school is still operating as usual. School policy states that students cannot have their phones out during class, and Angela Coppola, who teaches 10th and 11th grade history, confiscated up to six phones a class last year.“Adults struggle with the addictive nature of this technology, so you have to have compassion for children who have grown up with this technology,” she said. Coppola would support an effort to get students to go device free for the day. In her 11 years teaching, she said she’s seen the toll constant communication taken on her students. “If you talk to any teacher, we’ve all noticed in the past five years, we’ve definitely seen a spike in anxiety,” she said.“The technology is so persuasive,” Coppola said. “How can we expect people who are still developing to have stronger willpower than actual adults? We can’t.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b07f95e5340e9c679025409e3c2b3db95758221/0_86_5253_3152/master/5253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e18bf6837325d0fff1cb2ffe86c73956","title":"global heating brings mediterranean butterfly to uk","story":"Long-tailed blues and eggs seen in large numbers, but are unlikely to survive the British winterA fast-flying migratory butterfly from the Mediterranean is appearing in large numbers across southern England this summer as a result of global heating, experts say.More than 50 long-tailed blues and hundreds of the butterfly’s eggs have been discovered in recent weeks, which is likely to result in an unprecedented emergence of the butterfly in Britain later this autumn.Experts believe record-breaking summer temperatures have helped the effervescently coloured insect boom in number, with longer-term global heating helping it shift far north of its historical range.“We’ve never recorded this many migrant adults before – it’s completely unprecedented,” said Neil Hulme, of Butterfly Conservation, an expert on the long-tailed blue. “In only a few days, I’ve found more than 100 eggs in Sussex alone and the butterfly has been seen in Cornwall, Somerset, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, Kent and Suffolk. We’ve even had a sighting in Glamorgan, in south Wales.”The long-tailed blue is abundant in Africa and southern Europe but was once only an extremely rare visitor to Britain – possibly brought in accidentally on imported plants and vegetables. Only 30 butterflies were recorded over 80 years after it was first spotted in Britain in 1859.But this is the third time in six years that large numbers have crossed the Channel to reach the South Coast, with a record 109 sightings in 2013.The long-tailed blue may be small but it is a powerful flyer and lays eggs on plants such as everlasting pea, which are common in gardens and allotments. The eggs laid by migratory butterflies will emerge as adult butterflies at the end of September or in October, but British winters are too cold for the butterfly to survive.Hulme added: “In hot weather it can go through its entire life cycle in just over a month, which is half the period taken by many species. The caterpillar grows up inside the flowers and pods of peas and similar plants, hidden away from predators. It has the full toolkit for world domination.”This is proving to be a vintage year for migratory insects, with the largest invasion of painted lady butterflies since 2009 and other rarer migrant species such as the bedstraw hawkmoth and the queen of Spain fritillary also being recorded.Dan Hoare, of Butterfly Conservation, said the long-tailed blue sightings confirmed the butterfly was extending its geographical range northwards in response to global heating.“Our rapidly changing climate brings positives for some expanding species, while others may find it much harder to adapt and keep pace with the changes,” he said. “Butterflies, moths and other insects respond quickly to environmental change, providing an indicator of the impacts of a warming climate on the natural world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3e0cf0ae0086516c8a43810597fc356e0cd4f86/0_139_718_431/master/718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54cf706fa86d81421f8a72d3cd9a929e","title":"greta thunberg arrival in new york delayed by rough seas","story":"Swedish climate activist anchors off Coney Island as she nears end of her journey on zero-carbon yachtGreta Thunberg reached New York early on Wednesday, after crossing the Atlantic in a zero-carbon yacht.Crowds began to gather in New York hours before she was due to step ashore, ready to welcome Thunberg upon her arrival on the unconventional, solar-powered craft.Under cloudy skies at a marina near the southern tip of Manhattan, Thunberg’s supporters were assembling to greet the teenager who sparked a series of walk-outs by students protesting the lack of action to address the climate crisis.“Land!! The lights of Long Island and New York City ahead,” the Swedish climate activist had tweeted before dawn on Wednesday, shortly followed by another tweet that she was anchored just off the city, opposite the famous beach resort of Coney Island in Brooklyn, and was waiting to clear customs and immigration.She is due to dock at North Cove Marina on the edge of New York Harbor, on Wednesday afternoon.But before she even steps onto American soil, the boat will be welcomed by a flotilla of 17 sailing boats, each with one of the 17 sustainable development goals written on their sails. The special welcome convoy will intercept Thunberg’s yacht near the Statue of Liberty off the top of New York City.Thunberg is sailing to New York to attend a UN summit on zero emissions next month after refusing to fly there because of the carbon emissions caused by planes.She was offered a ride on the Malizia II racing yacht skippered by Pierre Casiraghi, the son of Princess Caroline of Monaco, and the German round-the-world sailor Boris Herrmann.The 16-year-old, whose school strikes have inspired children across the world to protest against the climate crisis, has encountered some rough seas on her passage across the Atlantic and was later arriving than expected.But as she was finally approaches the harbor in New York, the crowds were swelling.“I’ve been following her for the past year or so and am very enthusiastic about what she’s doing, how she’s got young people involved with the striking,” said Richard Walser, an IT technician who traveled down from Connecticut to welcome Thunberg with his son, CJ.Walser, wearing a T-shirt with the slogan “Ride bikes, do good”, said he hoped to get on board a boat as part of a welcoming flotilla for the Malizia II. “I’m a seasoned sailor and she seemed to have done very well in rough waters,” he said. “Nothing much seems to bother her.“People here in the US will welcome her, although some want to see her fail and be defeated of course. For me, I’m 56 and I don’t think climate change will be catastrophic in my time but things will certainly be worse for people who come after us. This was the challenge of our generation and we’ve dropped the ball.”One woman arrived at the marina clutching flowers and a placard that read “Welcome Greta.” The media was also out in force, including journalists from Chile, where world leaders will gather later this year for annual UN climate talks.Thunberg is set to travel to Chile for this event, although as yet it’s unclear how she will return home to Sweden given her aversion to flying due to its heavy fossil fuel use.Thunberg’s yacht left Plymouth in southern England on 14 August, and the teenager marked the first anniversary of the start of her school strike on 20 August.Greta began a sit-down protest outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to get members of parliament to act on climate change.She was quickly joined by other students around the world, as word of her strike spread through the media, and the “Fridays for future” movement was born.The 18-metre yacht features solar panels on its deck and sides, and two hydro-generators provide the vessel’s electricity.Her voyage sparked controversy, however, after a spokesman for Herrmann, the yacht’s co-skipper, told the Berlin newspaper TAZ that several people would fly into New York to take the yacht back to Europe.Hermann himself will also return by plane, according to the spokesman.Team Malizia’s manager insisted, however, that the young activist’s journey would be carbon neutral, as the flights would be offset.Greta has said she does not yet know how she will return to Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/191205732edd59824b8b6e69c436b7ac6a30f5d1/1_0_5330_3200/master/5330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a65295270fc0ae6e3d2ec10cd8cd737","title":"it made a great corpse bride costume meet the women recycling and reusing their wedding dresses","story":"Many women are refusing to retire their bridal gowns to the back of the wardrobe, in favour of wearing them again or repurposing them.  readers reveal what they did with theirs Catherine O’Nolan wears her wedding dress every year on her anniversary, regardless of where she is or what she is doing. That meant she once wore it on a ferry. She has also worn it to walk the dog on the beach near her home in Suffolk. She has eaten fish and chips in it, cut the grass in it, flown to Dublin in it. It’s not just any old frock made by the bridal specialist Jenny Packham, there is no mistaking what it is. Strangely, she says, nobody ever says a word.O’Nolan is one of a number of women who refuse to consign their wedding dresses to the back of the wardrobe – whether by repurposing them, recycling them or simply reusing them as they are. Some are building in flexibility ahead of the wedding, opting for outfits that will transition smoothly from aisle or register office to boardroom or holiday. After all, single-use dresses are bad for the environment and the bank balance, with the average British wedding dress last year costing nearly £1,400.Anita Gera was one of those who answered our call for stories about reusing wedding clothes. She got married in Copenhagen in 2006, and has continued to wear the constituent parts of her outfit – a tunic, trousers and dupatta (a long scarf) – to parties, although the marriage is now over. On a recent mini-cruise with her mum to Hamburg, a gala night provided an opportunity to wear the whole ensemble. It helps that it is bright red. “I grew up in India,” she explains, “so, to me, white is the colour of funerals and red is the colour you wear for joyous occasions.” While she wouldn’t wear her outfit in India, she felt comfortable on the cruise ship: “I know it’s my wedding outfit but to most people it will just look like some glamorous Bollywood-style outfit.”Sophie Pollard also bought an outfit she could wear again. Having met her wife at primary school in the Somerset village of Westbury-sub-Mendip, she married her in the local register office last year. She found the navy dress decorated with sunflowers for £14 on the internet it has seen outings to the dental laboratory (where she makes false teeth), as well as to a friend’s wedding where she was “best man” – she paired it with a black jacket to “jazz it up a bit”.Sanji, who married in 2017, has already reworn the lehenga (full ankle-length skirt) she wore then and plans to bring out her entire outfit later this month for a teej party, a traditional Nepali festival where women dress up, often in red.It can’t come too soon for the Dublin-based sustainability advocate Emma Gleeson. While much of the world is paring back in the name of the planet, she says, “the wedding thing seems to be getting more and more extreme”. For evidence, see the growing trend for multiple wedding outfits, as worn by the Duchess of Sussex and the singer Solange Knowles. For her own wedding, Gleeson settled on a white dress with a pattern on it. Not only did she want something she could wear again, but she disliked much of the culture surrounding wedding dresses. “I could see how bad my friends were made to feel by the shopping experience – people saying: ‘Oh well, you’ll be a size smaller by the time you wear this’ … horrible things like that.”Lesley Kazan-Pinfield was rejecting this kind of talk as long ago as 1980, when she wore a pair of homemade dungarees to get married at Truro register office. She continued to wear them until they fell apart.Other women find ways to recycle their dresses, beyond handing them down or selling them. It was only a week or two after her wedding in Burnley, 16 years ago, that Shaista got a call about a woman who lived in her mum’s old neighbourhood in Pakistan. Her husband had just died. “She had three or four young children. In Pakistan, there’s no welfare state, so Mum rang me saying: ‘Can you contribute anything? I’m having a whip-round.’”Shaista decided to donate her wedding dress. When it made it to the woman, “She just burst into tears – she saw it as ‘I’m going to be less reliant’” than if she had just been given some one-off money. The woman began charging people to borrow it for the day as Shaista describes it, it was “a micro-business for her, a wedding dress for those who could never afford to buy”.There are a number of charities that use old gowns for new purposes. When Georgia Keogh-Horgan got married in 2013 in a secondhand dress from eBay, she thought that it might be something a future child would be able to wear. Tragically, her son died just hours after birth, but she found a charity called Cherished Gowns that turned wedding dresses into funeral gowns for babies. “I think my wedding dress has been made into 11 gowns and little nappies. Babies who are born very small don’t always have nappies that fit,” she explains. “When your baby dies, you still want to dress them normally … Little things like that are quite important.”The repurposing of wedding outfits fits in with today’s fashion for crafts – sales of sewing machines have risen, and YouTube is now full of tutorials on how to knit hats and darn socks. But it has been going on for decades. When Lyn Armstrong got married in Sheffield in 1971, she didn’t have any preconceived notions of recycling her dress. Then, a few years later and six months pregnant, she needed an outfit for a dinner dance and didn’t want to buy something that she would probably never wear again. So she set to work turning her wedding dress into something inspired by Mary Quant. It seemed, she says, a “very appropriate fate for a wedding dress to become a maternity garment”.For her part, Mia Smith turned a section of her wedding dress into a stole when she was ordained as an Anglican priest in 2013, as well as fashioning others into christening gowns for her grandchildren. Ann Hill turned her wedding dress into a tennis outfit when money was short in the 1970s, while Angela Lorenz, a contemporary artist, cut her wedding dress up “for art”. Pieces of it are now in the British Library and other museums around the world.Rachael Falkner, who got married in Oxfordshire in 1990, discovered that her wedding dress was starting to yellow. So, a couple of years ago, after much pestering, she agreed to let her daughter use it as a corpse bride Halloween costume. “My friends were shocked. One described it as like using 100-year-old wine for beef bourguignon.” But “it made a great costume and we’ve had a good laugh out of it”.And then there are reuses that deliver much-needed catharsis. Lucy Morgan’s white wedding dress stayed in the loft for a long time after her wedding in 2002. But the year she got orced and turned 50, she retrieved it and dyed it green. It was a meaningful move for her: “New life, new growth,” she explains.Melanie Renn got married in the Appalachians in 1984. Twenty years into the marriage her husband left her. “I loved that dress and I’m sure I could have worn it again,” she says. Instead, she gave it to his new girlfriend, who was “thrilled”. The decision was an impulse but Renn stands by it: “I couldn’t bear to look at it any more. Everything that reminded me of him had to go.” It was, she says, the “best repurpose ever”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd1bfc970b00a7137eabf02c2111e870387cc94e/113_9_1401_841/master/1401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89d9b1fdf99b56bfcabe7eaa79a70b9b","title":"aniara review","story":"Disaster leaves a public spacecraft adrift and its social order on the brink of breakdown in this cleverly pertinent sci-fi chiller With Aniara, the Swedish writing-directing team Pella Kågerman and Hugo Lilja deliver a cold, cruel, piercingly humane sci-fi parable that’s both bang on the zeitgeist and yet also unnervingly original.In a near-ish future, the Earth seems to have been made effectively uninhabitable and everyone is moving to Mars. A massive spacecraft, as plushly appointed as any modern-day cruise ship with its buffet bars and play areas, sets off on the three-week voyage to the red planet. MR (Emelie Jonsson), a cheerful low-ranking shipmate, tries to entice passengers to experience the wonders of Mima, an artificially intelligent computer-projection-system-gizmo that taps into people’s memories in order to create an immersive, virtual-reality experience unique to each inidual. It’s like the Holodeck in Star Trek, but controlled by a not entirely benign consciousness, akin to the sentient planet in Solaris or maybe Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey.No one is very interested at first, but then an accidental collision with some space junk causes the ship to veer off course and the crew eject the ship’s propulsion system in order to avoid a nuclear meltdown. Sadly this also means they will all be adrift for at least a few years until they can slingshot around a planet or moon, so suddenly everyone wants to use Mima, putting a strain on MR’s resources and the AI being itself.That’s only the start of what evolves into a quirky, corrugated story that drifts, like the ship, into all kinds of eerie realms as the hitherto prim, eminently Scandinavian social order aboard breaks down. For those who thought the orgy scene in Sweden-set Midsommar was a bit coy, there’s an even more explicit shagfest here. As time passes, cults emerge and the society aboard the ship turns into a quasi-fascist state run by the patriarchal captain. MR and later her lover, Isagel (Bianca Cruzeiro), must struggle to survive the new off-world order and resist the vacuum of despair. The narrative air gets thinner in the last third of the film, but there’s a neat little stab in the ending and the whole design and camerawork package is hugely effective given what must have been a comparatively limited budget. Jonsson, with her plain-Jane features that can go from dowdy to luminous in a snap, is mesmerising to watch.

We cannot wait 200 years to decide whether his films are great or easily forgotten, an aesthetic judgment needs to be passed at once.”Lucrecia Martel, the president of the international jury at Venice, agreed that Polanski’s new film, An Officer and a Spy, should be included, although she disagreed with Barbera on the issue of introducing gender quotas at the festival. The lack of female directors in the main 21 entries – the only films directed by women come from Saudi director Haifaa Al Mansour (The Perfect Candidate) and Shannon Murphy (Babyteeth) – has been criticised, with Venice lagging behind other major festivals such as Cannes and Toronto.“Quotas are never satisfactory,” said Martel. “But there are no other solutions to guarantee the inclusion of women or give them the position they deserve.”Asked the same question Barbera said he is “fully against the idea of quotas for the selection of a film festival”, adding that it would “be offensive because it goes against the only criterion that we have to consider, which is the quality of the film”.The TruthVenice’s opening night spot goes to the latest film by Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose Shoplifters won top prize at Cannes last year.

Would the quality decrease? Or would it lead to a change in the industry? Perhaps it would be too bad if we were to implement an experiment like this?”The festival opened on Wednesday morning with Hirokazu Kore-eda’s first non-Japanese language film, The Truth, the story of an ageing French actor, played by Catherine Deneuve, who is coming to terms with her past and its impact on her daughter (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter’s husband (Ethan Hawke).Thursday sees the premieres of James Gray’s space epic Ad Astra and Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, which is gathering Oscar buzz for lead actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, and is the first of three films that Netflix is showing in Venice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b538400caf85f11cf8d2c31b14785b056485633/219_24_1486_892/master/1486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=772d7805f3a7be53374f7bc0f7e91175","title":"the laundromat trailer meryl steep rinses gary oldman and antonio banderas","story":"A first look at Steven Soderbergh’s crime caper about the Panama Papers, which premieres at the Venice film festival later this week, has been releasedTwelve years since the release of heist sequel Ocean’s 13, Steven Soderbergh appears to be repeating the trick, with a pointed yet irreverent take on the Panama Papers scandal.One of these is a fictitious widow, played by Meryl Streep, whose investigation of an insurance fraud leads to the uncovering of the firm’s dealings, and their links to the rich and powerful.An adaptation of Jake Bernstein’s non-fiction book Secrecy World, the true investigation, led by journalists, was one Soderbergh has said he was keen to play down, feeling such a narrative arc was overfamiliar.

Using a whisk, mix the flour and water in a saucepan. Switch to a spatula and continue to stir over a medium heat until the mixture has thickened to a pudding-like consistency and reached 65C150F. Pour into a bowl, cover with clingfilm (touching the surface of the tangzhong) and place in the freezer for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, use a microwave to warm the milk for the dough, then to melt the butter.Put the milk, butter, sugar, salt, egg and tangzhong in a large bowl. Whisk together.Add the flour and yeast. If using a mixer, knead for 10 minutes with the dough hook attachment on a low speed. If working by hand, use a spoon to combine everything into a shaggy ball, turn out on to a floured surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. Keep kneading until the dough is smooth – it will still be a little tacky, but that is normal. Don’t add extra flour.Place in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm. Leave to rise until two-three times its original size (this will take about 1-2 hours).Prepare the filling. Mix the cardamom with 100g pistachios and the caster sugar. Warm the butter until soft and spreadable.When the dough has risen, roll it out into a long rectangle (with the longest side facing you) on a lightly floured surface. Brush the surface with the butter, then sprinkle over the pistachio mixture. Roll up (from the longest side) into a tight scroll. Slice into 12 pieces using a sharp knife.

That’s the feeling we all have right now. It’s been dragging on a long time but even until late on Tuesday night there was a bit of hope that the club might have a future. We’d heard there were a few late offers to buy it but then the deadline passed and the EFL felt they needed to expel us.I was at home when it happened. I was watching Sky Sports and it broke on there. I saw the statement but I didn’t know it was coming. I never got a heads-up on anything.Throughout the whole process there has been a state of uncertainty for us players. The first time we hear anything, it’s at the same time as everyone else. When EFL statements go live, that’s when we hear.We haven’t been able to play any matches this season but while the situation has dragged on we’ve carried on working. We’ve been in all pre‑season, since 1 July. We went in on Wednesday. We’ve been training as normal, preparing for games, then we get to the weekend and they’re cancelled.It’s been a nightmare, it’s been tough in training and it’s been tough away from the ground too. We have had some wages, we got last month’s, but we’re still owed our pay for a few months before that and I don’t know if we’ll ever see it we’ve had nothing from the EFL or the PFA on that.There is a real togetherness among the squad. I think that’s probably the main reason we’ve been able to get as far as we have. We’re all in same boat together, going through similar things, but with some of the lads you can tell they’re struggling. People look stressed. You can see how it’s affecting people.We stick together but the truth is that the training ground is dead low, morale is at rock bottom. When you aren’t there you just try to get away from it.We’re definitely looking at the whole situation and asking questions. It looks like the owner had a fair few other businesses that were liquidated. It’s beyond me and the other lads as to how you could allow him in to buy a football club. We thought there were supposed to be tests before that could happen and there’s a few questions that need to be asked.Despite the news we’re all still in limbo a little bit. I don’t know how long it may drag on, but for sure something as big as this is not going to go away straight away. A lot of people are affected and I think the EFL need to be transparent about what’s going on. I’ve not had any direct communication from the EFL and neither have any of my teammates as far as I’m aware. I thought they would make some attempt at least.We’re still hearing these rumours about new bidders for the club and a lot of people round here are asking why the EFL could not have extended the deadline a bit further. I know they say there are rules in place but something like this last happened, what, 27 years ago? It’s a unique case and we need to use common sense and maybe a bit of leniency. Just look at how many people it will affect.The collapse of the club has turned people’s lives upside down. People have lost their jobs. The players have signed contracts when they came to the club in good faith, thinking you’d get what you’re owed. We’ve worked hard for that money only for it to disappear halfway through.It was only three months ago that we were celebrating promotion to League One. That seems like such a long time away now. The lads did great to achieve promotion and I feel for them all and all the staff especially."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65d91d6d62f4f689c1b0e027a56d352f96ab4537/0_261_5351_3211/master/5351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e157386589ae7f4092447cebceb9ae6","title":"bury expelled from efl after 125 years updates and reaction live","story":"That’s all folks: And on that comical bombshell, it’s time to close this blog for the day. Thank you for your time and your correspondence and keep your eyes peeled for a first person account of the whole Bury meltdown from their winger, Harry Bunn. Speaking to Sky Sports, the Bury owner, Steve Dale, has called on the EFL to rescind the decision to expel his club from the Football League. Should his request go unanswered, he says he will demand the appointment of an independent adjudicator to review the decision.“If the many requests to rescind remain unanswered we believe an independent adjudicator should be brought in,” he said. “We also want a secret ballot of all EFL clubs to ask the question if they want fellow clubs Bolton and Bury FC to be taken out of the league, I don’t think they would want that.”An email: I wrote earlier about how Jim White had addressed accusations of crassness from football fans after standing in front of a countdown clock on Sky Sports News yesterday as Bury headed towards oblivion.White mounted a fairly stirring defence of his actions on his Talksport show and was quick to point out, correctly, that he has done plenty to tackle the issues facing Bolton and Bury fans in recent weeks, by interviewing all the main players involved on a regular basis. Anyway, reader Thomas Atkins has got in touch to add his two cents ... “Fair to make the point about Jim White not necessarily being responsible for how crass he looked stood in front of the countdown, but I think it’s also fair to say that Sky Sports have been part of many of the decisions that make life so difficult for EFL clubs – the increased concentration of wealth in the top tier, the influx of monies from disreputable sources, the encouragement, both implicitly and explicitly, to gamble financially wherever the opportunity presents itself,” he says. “These people call themselves journalists and should be holding people to account. Where were they when the EFL was waving through the purchase of the club by a man clearly not fit and proper to do so?The curious case of Bobby Duncan: While assorted Football Financial Woe correspondents write up their hot takes on the day’s developments, or lack thereof, at Bolton and Bury, an interesting, if unedifying row is brewing on Twitter.Saif Rubie, a Dubai-based football agent who numbers Liverpool youngster Bobby Duncan among his clients, has posted a lengthy statement accusing Liverpool of keeping Duncan at the club against his will, causing the 17-year-old mental anguish in the process. In a Tweet, which Duncan pinned to his own Twitter account, before removing it and all trace of his Liverpool FC connections from his account, Rubie attacked Liverpool and their sporting director Michael Edwards, prompting Jamie Carragher to wade into the row.Duncan, 17, was previously best known for being the cousin of Steven Gerrard, and he scored his first goal for Liverpool in pre-season. The club, meanwhile, have strongly denied Rubie’s claim. “Liverpool Football Club is aware of and disappointed by the unattributed comments and unfounded allegations that have been made in the media regarding one of our players,” they said in a statement. “As the interests of the player in question are not best served by either inaccurate speculation, inflammatory statements or public discourse, we will be making no further comment. We will, however, continue our efforts to work privately with the player to find resolution in the best interests of all involved.”An email: “Obviously these are cold-hearted financial decisions with extremely harsh consequences for people whose identity is strongly linked to their football club,” writes Michael Allen.“But unfortunately it follows on logically from the way the football industry is run. It runs deeply into the culture of merciless free-market capitalism it seems to me. So there’s no solution except some kind of revolution and that’s unlikely where fans of the top richest teams are perfectly happy with things as they are (the gift that keeps on giving) and fans of many other clubs by contrast are just hanging on – in hope? Maybe they can look to alternatives viz AFC Wimbledon, FC United, Salford, Forest Green.” DOesn’t look like they’ll have much choice now that liquidation seems to be on the cards, Michael. Here’s hoping that once everyone else has moved on from this – and it will soon stop being headline news – there is enough enthusiasm in Bury to set up a phoenix club.While Bury have been expelled from the Football League, it is important to remember they still exist as a Football Club, albeit one with millions of pounds worth of debt and no source of income because they have no competition to play in and no way of generating revenue.David Conn has been in touch to say that this may not be the case for much longer, as imminent liquidation of the club seems the most likely outcome.“Sadly hearing that the most likely future for the club now is liquidation,” he tweets. “Having been expelled from the EFL after 125 years they effectively have no business now. The players are free agents as it isn’t an EFL club and can leave.”A Tweet from Michael Hann, a diehard QPR fan and former music editor of this parish ...Meanwhile at Bolton Wanderers: Having seen their club issued with a 14-day notice to resolve their own ongoing financial issues or face expulsion from the Football League, Bolton fans are waiting for news of what fate lies in store for their club, a founder member of the Football League.Speaking on Talksport this morning, Debbie Jevans, executive chair of the EFL, said talks regarding a takeover are ongoing. “We finished working with Bolton and the administrator at 3am this morning,” she said. “Everybody wants that deal to close. “I’m saying it’s very close and I know people will be shouting at the radio when I say that as they’ve heard it before, but what we couldn’t have again was a situation where you’ve got young players out there playing, losing 5-0 every week – that is not a sustainable way to run a football league.“So we’ve issued that notice and lifted the suspension. But I will say to everyone, that at 3am this morning conversations were still ongoing.”Meanwhile at The Athletic, Simon Hughes has published a lengthy special investigation in which he reveals that many Bolton players and staff have not been paid for five months, even though former Rushden and Diamonds chairman Keith Cousins has earned £30,000 per month from administrators David Rubins and Partners for helping to run the club and trying to secure its sale.Hughes also reveals that Cousins has “earned five per cent from money generated by players being sold or released and stands to pocket another two per cent of any takeover deal”.Squires: There are have been no shortage of hot takes on the situation at Bury and Bolton, but few have nailed it so thoroughly as our resident cartoonist David Squires, with this incendiary closing panel in this week’s offering. Video: “There’s been grown men ... 50-year-old men, 60-year-old men here crying. Some of them don’t cry at their own daughters’ weddings. They come down here and they’re in buckets of tears.”An email: “I know that Parliament has other matters at hand at the moment, however the solution to this “BuryBoltonwho’s next?” crisis ultimately will lay in its hands,” writes Hubert O’Hearn. “The time truly has come for clubs to be given the option of community ownership similar to the NFL’s Green Bay Packers. The argument against it generally runs: ‘How can the town council of Bury be expected to compete for players and other resources against oil sheiks and American billionaires?’”“This is all off the top of my head so there may be flaws, but you have to start somewhere.”Well? Let’s all start picking holes in Hubert’s, on the face of it, eminently sensible suggestion. I’ll get the ball rolling by asking why he thinks the solution to this crisis will end up in Parliament’s hands? And even if it does, why does he think they will make anything other than a complete dog’s breakfast of solving it? Andy Holt tweets: The chairman and major shareholder of Accrington Stanley, Andy Holt is one of the good guys when it comes to club ownership and his club is lucky to have him in charge, when so many others are owned by spivs, hucksters and charlatans. This informative thread he posted on Twitter is well worth a couple of minutes of your time.What with the expulsion of Bury from the Football League being such an emotive issue, we’ve been unable to open the comments on this live blog today. Social media suggests that football fans around the world have plenty to say on the matter, much of it extremely heartfelt and – sadly – potentially libellous.However, we would like to hear from you, so feel free to ping me a tweet or email, or share your reaction to Bury’s collapse and explain what it means to you in the bespoke form below. Thanks! More fans are gathering, sheltering from the rain beside turnstiles which only 24 hours ago showed ticket prices for Saturday’s now-abandoned game against Doncaster Rovers. Some fans are huddled under umbrellas, checking their phones for the latest news others are just here because it feels like the right place to be today.Tamoor Tariq, the deputy leader of Bury council, said his local authority was ready to support the club any way it can to ensure its survival, starting with reassuring fans about the future of its stadium, a fixture here since 1884.He said: “I want to be absolutely clear that if anyone thinks there will be any development on that site any time soon then they are totally misguided - planning law doesn’t allow it, the fact that it’s an asset of community value also means there are restrictions governing it.”He wouldn’t be drawn on whether the council would chip in to help buy the club if supporters formed a Community Interest Company (like at Darlington FC in 2013) but he pointed out that the authority was also in financial difficulty, having suffered massive budget cuts since 2010.Asked whether a fan-owned club looked was the most likely way forward for Bury FC, Tariq said: “Something needs to change. The immediate thing that need to happen is Mr Dale needs to depart from the club, he needs to give up all of his links and he needs to decide how quickly he’s going to do that and allow - whether it’s the fans or another buyer - other people to lead the ship.It’s a sorry state of affairs that he’s allowed this situation to develop because he entered negotiations with C\u0026ampN at a very late stage. Had he been open to dialogue at an earlier stage maybe the outcome last night would have been different.”Conclusion: Going by what Jevans says, it seems that unless their hand is forced, the EFL will do precisely nothing to get their house in something approaching order in the wake of Bury’s expulsion.More than half of the 71 remaining league clubs outside the Premier League are living beyond their means and with the turkeys who run many of them extremely unlikely to vote for Christmas, what happened to Bury will inevitably happen to other clubs. Lots of other clubs.More from David Conn: “There is no commitment to independent regulation, nor to any form of investigation into the details of what has happened at Bury,” he says, following his chat with Jevans.“She says they will receive information from C \u0026amp N Sporting Risk who did due diligence, and then consider any further action or investigation. The EFL is conducting a governance review, which will examine the ‘fit and proper persons’ owners and directors test and the financial regulations she declined to make any suggestions herself for reforms it should consider.” David Conn tweets. He’s been talking to Debbie Jevans and the Football League’s executive chair says she’s “devastated” by the her organisation’s decision to expel Bury from the Football League. But no so devastated that she’s prepared to do anything to stop it happening other clubs beyond making vague noises about asking them to control their costs. Good luck with that, Debbie!A tweet from Ivan Lewis: The Independent MP for Bury South remains convinced that Bury can and should still be saved from expulsion from the Football League.Josh Halliday, the ’s North of England correspondent who steered me in the direction of the Tweet, says he has spoken to Tamoor Tariq, the deputy leader of Bury council, who demanded that owner Steve Dale relinquish control of the club and urged the EFL to rethink its decision.“Many fans have expressed concerns that Gigg Lane, Bury’s home since 1885, could be sold off and turned into flats given the club’s collapse,” he tells me. “But Tariq guaranteed that the council would not let that happen. There are planning laws in place, he said, to protect Gigg Lane as a sporting ground and Bury FC as a community institution.” A Bury FC player speaks. Speaking to Talksport earlier this morning, Bury’s 33-year-old midfielder Stephen Dawson seemed resigned to having to sell his house.“I’ve been onto the mortgage adviser this morning because that is the end,” he said. “There’s no two ways about it now, that is it for me.“I’ve played my whole career and put everything into my house and my kids to give them a start in life when they are 18, whether that be a deposit for a house or money for college.“I don’t have the fancy cars or the fancy clothes as I was never in a position to earn the thousands and thousands the really good players earn.” The week before last, Dawson and Bury owner Steve Dale had a frank and bad-tempered exchange of views on the radio station, in which Dale openly rubbished the notion that Dawson might have to sell his home to make ends meet. Horse bolts, MP wants to know why stable door was left open: Damian Collins has called for a full review of the English Football League’s role in Bury’s demise.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, claimed the EFL has let Bury’s fans down after expelling the club from its competition and said new laws were needed to safeguard other clubs from potential rogue owners.“The process run by @efl has failed fans of @buryfcofficial \u0026amp may do the same to @OfficialBWFC,” the MP for Folkestone and Hythe, tweeted. “Next week CommonsCMS will discuss how we can review the role of the football authorities in this crisis \u0026amp what new powers are needed to act against bad owners and directors of clubs.” Greetings, one and all. The broadcaster Jim White shipped a lot of abuse on social media yesterday for standing in front of a Sky Sports News graphic of a countdown clock, as he reported on the goings-on at Bury and Bolton. Assorted viewers accused him and the network that employs him of appearing to revel in Bury’s demise in the tackiest manner imaginable.Well, this morning on his Talksport show, Jim addressed the issue. He said that while he appreciated that people might have found the graphic tacky, he has no control over behind-the-scenes production at Sky. He also went on to address the crusading he has done on behalf of Bury and Bolton fans on Talksport in recent weeks, “because that’s what we do”. “And for some reason they talk to us and that’s what I want. The important thing today is Bolton and Bury, not some ticking clock.” Jim finished up by having a right go at somebody on Twitter posting under a made-up name who claimed he was revelling in Bury’s demise. Full disclosure: I know Jim, albeit barely. I am also a colleague of his at Talksport, although I have only ever done one show with him.While I suspect a man of his status might have more clout than he is letting on when it comes to the behind-the-scenes goings-on at Sky Sports News when it comes to shows he is presenting, I genuinely can’t think of any other national broadcaster who has done more in recent weeks to highlight the peril in which Bury and Bolton find themselves. The people criticising him for apparently “revelling” in Bury’s demise seem strangely reluctant to acknowledge those efforts. Time for me to hand over to Barry Glendenning. He’ll keep you updated on events in Bury for the rest of the day.“I shed tears this morning when I read about Bury FC’s demise,” John Harker says. “That surprised me. Why I asked myself as a Sheffield United supporter celebrating life in the Premier League, should I care about a lower league club I have no connection to, do not support and never will.“The answer is I think because I love the game, its history and traditions. I am connected to Bury and to Bolton Wanderers as is everyone who loves the game in this country whether we know it or not. No man is an island, just as no football club is an island. There but for the grace of God go we. Every football supporter knows that in hisher heart of hearts. They know it even more this morning.“The only crumb of comfort I can offer those loyal supporters is that this isn’t necessarily the end. Look at Accrington Stanley just up the road. It took time but it can be done. The best of luck to you.”Neil Danns, the Bury FC captain who helped win the club promotion last season, said the club’s collapse had “damaged many, many lives” and called for “the powers that be” to be held accountable.He told BBC Radio Manchester: “Devastated is an understatement. You see some of the staff members that have been working thee for years in turmoil and wondering what’s going to happen. It’s been something I wouldn’t wish on any fan or player.”Danns said owner Steve Dale had contacted him earlier this summer and assured him that “everything was going to be okay” despite mounting questions over the club’s finances. He said questions now need to be asked of Dale, the previous owner Stewart Day, and the EFL.He added: “People have got to stand up and be accountable because it’s damaged many, many lives. You see people crying outside the ground, young fans waking up this morning with no football team, and that’s a sad, sad situation in this day and age ... There’s definite questions that have to be asked, not just of the owner and previous owners but also the powers that be.”Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee and MP for Folkestone and Hythe Damian Collins has said the role of the football authorities and any possible changes to power will be reviewed in the House of Commons next week. EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans admitted rescheduling five postponed matches became a major factor in reaching the decision to expel Bury from the Football League. This is an action that was taken, that was done with much regret and I’m feeling devastated to be here talking to you. We simply ran out of time, having already postponed five matches, it would have been six matches. We were struggling to fit that in and it was with deep regret that we just couldn’t go on anymore. We went into everything that was sent to us with detail, trying to do everything that we could to save the club.”Jevans admitted that the EFL “needs to learn some lessons” and she believes lower league clubs should consider the option of a salary cap. We need to sit back, we need to look back, we need to learn some lessons. I’m speaking personally, I’m speaking for myself here. I think absolutely we need to look at the spend of clubs as much as the revenues, and looking at salary caps is absolutely something that I think the clubs should consider.”Bolton have confirmed that “any plans that may have been made for the immediate closure of the club have been put on hold” by the administrator.A petition calling for the creation of an independent regulator for football has almost 6000 signatures.Former Wigan chairman David Sharpe has offered his sympathy to Bury.An email. “A very sad day for Bury FC, their supporters and the town,” David Roberts says. “As a lifelong Hereford United fan I know what you are going through and the anger and frustration. There is however light at the end of the tunnel…..we rose from the ashes as a phoenix club, Hereford FC, and started over again. A long road back but one to look forward to. Keep the faith!!!!!!!!”The Bolton Wanderers Supporters Trust has sent its “heartfelt sympathy” to Bury fans and offered any help it can this morning. The mutual support shown by fans of both financially-stricken clubs, north-west rivals who were due to play each other a week on Saturday, has been brilliant to see.This is without doubt a sad day for Bury FC, their supporters and the local community. We appreciate how hard this decision has been for all parties involved.Following on from their expulsion from the English Football League, Bury FC will no longer be able to participate in the Emirates FA Cup for the 201920 season. We are therefore now consulting with our stakeholders regarding the first round proper following their exit from the league.If the club re-forms we look forward to them applying to make an application to The Football Association to re-join league competition further down the English football pyramid from the 202021 season.Sports minister Nigel Adams has said the EFL must look into the circumstances surrounding Bury’s plight.This is a very dark day for English football. It is a tragedy for the fans of Bury, the local community and everyone connected with the historic club. There will be a huge amount of anger and disbelief about how this happened. I have been in regular contact with the EFL and it is right that they closely review the processes at Bury to see if any lessons can be learned. The club’s passionate fans don’t deserve to go through this. I hope once the dust has settled they can begin to rebuild and take inspiration from other clubs that have done so before them.”Here’s a strongly worded thread on Twitter from Accrington Stanley owner Andy Holt.The PFA have released a statement on Bury’s expulsion from the Football League.It is with great sadness to hear that Bury have been expelled from the English Football League after a takeover bid from C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk collapsed.We have been in regular communication with the players, the EFL and the club over the last eight months to try and protect our members and secure a long-term future for Bury FC.Unfortunately, despite our efforts to support the process, the club has been unable to fulfill its financial commitments or complete a possible take-over deal.This will be a desperately sad time for Bury’s players and staff.We will continue to support all our members who have been impacted by the current situation, including former players, the remaining players who are contracted at the club and also those who were hoping to sign contracts.Our thoughts in particular go out to the supporters, the town and the wider community who will be devastated by this news.Our reporter David Conn wrote a damning piece on the Bury debacle yesterday.After such grinding and unnecessary failures precipitating expulsion from the Football League for Bury, a 134-year-old club founded by late Victorian civic-minded chaps in 1885, there have to be inquiries, lessons learned and reforms. The English Football League has promised to upgrade its rules to prevent such an implosion ever happening again. The Labour MP for Bury North, James Frith, who has worked relentlessly to expose ugly truths and to help save the club, has called for investigations and parliamentary scrutiny.The two modern, analytical young football men, Rory Campbell and Henry Newman, who decided not to proceed with their deadline-day proposed purchase, made clear in their statement that stronger governance is needed and the Bury wreckage was the result of “systemic failings ... over a number of years”.The FA have announced that Bury will not be involved in this season’s FA Cup. They would have entered the first round in November.If you’re a Bury fan, what do you do without football on a Saturday? This could happen to fans of any lower league club, you know. A football club plays such a crucial role in a local community and means so much to so many people. It’s part of their lives. You never think it won’t be there. What do you do without it?In other grim news Bolton Wanderers could yet go the same way as Bury. They have been given 14 days to find a buyer.Bury captain Neil Danns delivered a strong message to owner Steve Dale yesterday.“I would say look what you’ve done. This should never have happened. If you thought you could not move this club forward in a positive way you should never have taken over because you’ve literally destroyed lives, because that’s what this football club meant to so many fans. When you see the devastation of the fans I just think I have to say something. It’s unbelievable. I still can’t believe it. We have been in as normal, training. I don’t think anyone really believed that this was going to happen. We were just preparing every single week as though the next game was going to be on, the next game was going to be on. For it to happen so suddenly, it’s still really unbelievable. For a club with so much history and that has added so much to the league, for it to just be gone like that is just unimaginable.”Danns was captain of the side that won promotion from League Two last season. I’ve come to have a special bond with the fans and created some amazing memories, especially last year. At this moment in time I just feel for them the most because you have got people who have been going to the game for years. It’s like every story, you go to the game with your Grandad, your Mum, your Dad, your brothers, it’s such a community. It means so much to people. For me, it’s starting to hit me harder because I have got young sons myself. I know what it is like to take them to watch my boyhood team Liverpool and the bond that gives us. To see that taken away from future fans is just devastating. Football brings not just football on the pitch but it is so much more than that. This whole situation just does not feel real.”Dave Giffard, the chair of Forever Bury Supporters Club, says that fans are discussing their next move. We have got a meeting this morning to look at our next move. What we would like to do is try and save this football club. If we have to restart as a phoenix club we would like to get hold of this ground. We have the support of the council.”Hello. This is a dark day for English football. Bury have been expelled from the Football League after 125 years of membership after after the EFL board finally ran out of patience with its financial collapse and owner, Steve Dale. The deadline for the club to find a new owner passed on Tuesday afternoon, with a proposed sale to C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk collapsing earlier in the day. Shame on Dale, shame on the EFL, shame on the Football Association. We’ll have rolling reaction here today as Bury supporters reel from the shock of their club’s expulsion from the league."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50b36868895edcda092a9796a7305d9d0a52d92f/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41c60602133f01884ca4e4707f6d0f02","title":"premier league top scorers great advert championship","story":"By Martin Laurence for WhoScoredRaúl Jiménez’s late equaliser for Wolves against Burnley on Sunday afternoon was the 82nd goal in the Premier League so far this season. It’s a decent return from 30 matches in three weeks – averaging out at 2.73 per game. Of the 80 goals scored at the right end of the pitch, only 50 have come from players who started last season in the Premier League. So, who accounts for the other 30?It is perhaps an early sign that the gap between the top two leagues in England is not as big as we thought. From an attacking standpoint at least, there is real quality to be found below the Premier League. Nine of the top 10 scorers in the Championship last season are now in the Premier League, having either been promoted or signed over the summer, and they are faring very well. Indeed, of the 14 players who have scored at least two goals in the Premier League this season, five were in the Championship a few months ago: Teemu Pukki, Harry Wilson, Tammy Abraham, Daniel James and Mason Mount.All four of Chelsea’s league goals this season have been scored by players who spent last season on loan in the second tier. Questions were asked about whether Mount and Abraham were ready for the top flight – and those murmurings grew even louder after Chelsea’s 4-0 defeat to Manchester United on the opening weekend – but the young duo have really stepped up.Mount scored Chelsea’s first goal of the season against Leicester before contributing a second against Norwich on Saturday, a game Chelsea won thanks to a brace from Abraham, who is coming off a prolific season in the Championship with Aston Villa. Mount is only 20 and Abraham is only 21, but they have already shown the confidence and desire required to score a lot of goals in the Premier League. Mount has taken 12 shots so far this season only Ashley Barnes, on 13, has more.Mount and Abraham were not the only former Championship players lighting up the Premier League at the weekend. Harry Wilson, who spent last season playing alongside Mount on loan at Derby, hit a stunning free-kick for Bournemouth against Manchester City – continuing his knack for scoring long-range goals in the Premier League.Daniel James also found the top corner with a fantastic finish in Manchester United’s defeat to Crystal Palace on Saturday to take his account for the season to two, while Teemu Pukki was on the scoresheet yet again for Norwich City. The 29-year-old striker scored one and set up another against Chelsea, taking his tally to five in the league so far – putting him top of the scoring charts alongside Raheem Sterling. Pukki has scored more goals than Arsenal, who sit third in the table.The Finland international arrived at Norwich last summer on a free transfer and hit 29 goals in his debut campaign in English football, helping his club secure the Championship title. He has carried that sensational form into the top flight. It’s still early days, but all three promoted clubs have a win on the board and they are all sitting above the bottom three. At the very least, they have shown that they will compete this season.In fact, early signs show this season may prove more competitive than last year. Wolves and Watford are the only two clubs in the league who have not secured a victory yet in the Premier League after three matches last season, seven clubs were still waiting for a win. Just one point separates Manchester United in fifth from Newcastle United in 19th in the table at this early stage. There is cause for optimism that this season will be more competitive than last.

From the founders of Black Girl Fest – the first arts festival to celebrate black women and girls – to gal-dem magazine’s Liv Little, shaving off our hair has become the busy black woman’s equivalent of Steve Jobs wearing the same polo neck and jeans combo every day, given how long our hair can take to prep. Black women’s hair is known for its versatility (the recent viral #DMXChallenge, which saw countless video montages of black women flawlessly rocking various different styles, attests to this) – so a shaved head is easy and eliminates an overwhelming range of choice.Since my afro was large and healthy when I shaved it off, the assumption was that something must have gone wrong: traction alopecia from the tight hairstyles black women endure is a common reason for a drastic cut. Many women do a “big chop” to be rid of hair damaged by heat and chemicals. A bad breakup is often assumed, or a quarter-life crisis (as my dad still suspects). These are all valid reasons, but mine was far less interesting – I simply decided to cut it because I thought it would suit me.This proved difficult to digest for the men at the barbershop I visited with my boyfriend, at whom most of the questions about my decision were directed. Was he “OK with it”, the barber asked. I explained that my boyfriend had picked the shop and was paying for the cut (as well as the manicures we’d be getting after, like a caricature millennial couple). No barber had ever asked my boyfriend what his girlfriend thought of his haircut – whether he was rocking a skin fade or high top. My barber, it turned out, had actually shaved his own wife’s hair after she began to experience hair loss, but another female client had had a far less tolerant husband, who “hadn’t touched her since”, he said.Even when it is absent, black women’s hair is an incessant talking point (so much so that poet Ruth Sutoyé curated an entire exhibition on the experiences of black women who shave their heads). Our hair, or lack of it, is public property, to be touched and commented on by just about anyone. It is perceived to be making a statement beyond appearance: weaves emulating straight hair are seen as an exercise in white supremacist self-hate, afros are seen as radical political statements, as opposed to the result of letting hair grow naturally. “How about, at your next TV opp’ you show us your natural hair?” one hair-care brand tweeted me and Elizabeth Uviebinené, the co-author of our book Slay in Your Lane last year. The request was even more peculiar, given the fact that I had regularly worn my natural hair. But when you are a black woman in the public eye even the regularity with which you wear a hairstyle must be dictated.Here is a tip of my own: if unsolicited commentary about a black woman’s hair doesn’t include an offer to help with the several hours of deep conditioning and detangling that comes with “wash day”, then save it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da0f5c64a03ab4841a69fa0b27e6d2339b316f35/274_300_4073_2444/master/4073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5316b373b104228adfe9b7269dfd38f8","title":"lambeth council permitted development rules","story":"We started work on a loft conversion in May last year. The standard L-shaped dormer came under permitted development rights which do not require planning permission. But when the work began we applied for an optional certificate of lawfulness from Lambeth council. It didn’t review our application until September when it was rejected. It turned out that the planning department had unilaterally reinterpreted the rules in August 2018 without notifying residents, builders or architects. L-shaped dormers are now no longer considered a permitted development, although they are in other London boroughs. Six weeks later, we were served an enforcement notice. The government’s guidance states that certificates of lawfulness are optional and many builders don’t bother to apply. This means there may now be hundreds of “illegal” lofts in Lambeth. If a council can change the rules overnight without notification, it creates a trap for builders and, by interpreting the rules differently, defeats the purpose of permitted development legislation. Permitted development rules were intended to free small projects from red tape. They have proved contentious, partly because of how poorly they were drafted.However, the guidance issued by the government seems clear that L-shaped dormers are permitted and, at the time you submitted your application, Lambeth council accepted this.In a letter to you it stated that an application for a certificate of lawfulness is not an application for planning permission, but is to establish whether works were lawful at the time the application was made.Which they were. However, Lambeth seemed intent on applying its new rules retrospectively, saying: “The council’s approach has been dictated by appeal decisions since the summer of 2018, which have shown government planning inspectors have, in the main, not been recognising most L-shaped dormers as falling within permitted development. The council is mindful that some of the proposals recently refused will likely be appealed and is awaiting the outcome as a guide to dealing with such proposals going forward.”The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government merely says: “Interpretation of permitted rights is a matter for the local planning authority in the first instance. An applicant can appeal where it considers the authority has not interpreted the rights correctly.”You have since done so and won, but it has left you £5,000 out of pocket. The court refused to award you costs because it decided it was reasonable for the council to review its approach following a series of appeal decisions.Your experience suggests the law is a shambles. Anyone considering extending their home would be wise to apply for a certificate before starting work because, it seems, neither council nor government can agree on what the rules really mean.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Of the total, £340m was paid out in June alone.As many as 64m PPI policies were sold in the UK, but very often the cover was mis-sold. Banks and other financial institutions pushed the policies alongside loans, mortgages, credit cards and other deals.The FCA has been running a campaign to raise awareness of the deadline, leading to a more than fivefold increase in its website users and a near eightfold increase in calls compared with the previous nine weeks. The latest figures show that more than 5.4 million people have accessed its PPI website and it has received more than 102,000 phone calls.The FCA website includes a list of providers that sold PPI.

They said any additional funding was welcome, but that the £3.5bn on offer was nowhere near enough to repair the damage caused by years of sustained cuts.There was also widespread alarm about proposals for a package of disciplinary measures, including a renewed emphasis on exclusions and support for the use of “reasonable force” to improve behaviour in schools.Jules White, a headteacher who has played a key role in the Worth Less? campaign for more money for schools, said the government should come clean on funding. “Heads will not be hoodwinked by a large-sounding number that in fact merely covers rising costs in areas such as employer pensions and higher pupil numbers,” he said.“We are not mugs and will only be influenced by what is right for schools and families rather than any short-term political motives.” He said special educational needs (SEN) alone would require a multibillion commitment to put right the wrongs of the past.Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the promised money fell far short of the additional £12.6bn schools and colleges would need by 2022-23 to address the funding crisis.“Obviously any extra money for schools will be welcome because schools are desperate for funding,” she said. “The problem is this just isn’t enough.”A  callout to readers working in education attracted a similar response.“Being in education for as long as I have has taught me to be pretty sceptical about these announcements about extra money,” said one chair of trustees for a multi-academy trust in eastern England. “By the time it’s passed through various filters and arrives at our door, it looks considerably different to what you were expecting from the original announcement.”The educational psychologist Dr Dan O’Hare spoke for many when he expressed grave concerns about the government’s tough new line on behaviour. “Behaviour for children and young people is a form of communication,” he said. “Children have a reason for demonstrating the behaviours they do. We should be trying to find out the reasons rather than just disciplining them.”Others responded with outrage to the government’s apparent green light for more exclusions. William Muir, the writer-in-residence at HMP Parc in Bridgend, said: “As someone who has worked in prison for almost nine years, a common history shared by a lot of men is exclusion from mainstream education.“We should be actively promoting policies and funding to keep young people in mainstream education as much as possible when they are young, vulnerable and susceptible to criminal influences. This isn’t do-gooding, it’s common sense.”The potential impact of the government’s plans on teaching assistants (TAs) was also an area of concern. The leaked document revealed that the Treasury and No 10 believe there are too many, and that they are not effectively deployed.Rob Webster, an associate professor at the UCL institute of education, who has done extensive research on the role of TAs, said: “Cutting the number of TAs creates much bigger problems not very far down the line. We’ve built our systems of support for children with special educational needs around the employment of these people in schools. TAs are like the mortar in the brickwork. They are what is holding the school together in a way that does not often get seen.”Donna Spicer, a TA for 18 years, said budget cuts had resulted in TA roles being axed in schools across the borough of Greenwich in south-east London, where she works – like elsewhere in England – and the impact was already being felt by pupils and staff.A single secondary school in her borough has lost 19 support staff,” she said. “It has a massive impact on schools. Pupils who need one-to-one support are left behind without extra support and it’s the teachers who then struggle – it’s particularly difficult for newly qualified teachers who are struggling anyway.”Additional reporting by Naomi Larsson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01a8ba42330f41f90c8de17da5d4dac0be4c4926/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8977d19abce7e6e296cfd7f1adacc14d","title":"chancellor sajid javid fast tracked spending review fuels talk of early election","story":"Decision will cut dramatically the time MPs will have to take action to prevent no-deal BrexitBoris Johnson has set up an extraordinary confrontation with MPs when they return to Westminster next week by announcing that he has asked the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks from mid-September.The prime minister claimed there would be “ample time” to debate Brexit, as he wrote to MPs on Wednesday, saying he had spoken to the Queen and asked her to suspend parliament from “the second sitting week in September”. Later on Wednesday the Queen approved the order.MPs will then not return to Westminster until 14 October, when he said there would be a new Queen’s speech, setting out what he called a “bold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda for the renewal of our country after Brexit”.The effect of the decision will be to curtail the time MPs have to introduce legislation or other measures aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit – and increase the pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence next week.If Johnson lost that vote, there would then be a 14-day period in which Corbyn, or an alternative candidate, could seek to assemble a majority. If no new government emerges, a general election would then have to be held.But government sources insist Johnson is determined not to go to the polls before Britain is due to leave the EU. “We have been very clear that if there’s a no confidence vote, he won’t resign. We get to set an election date. We don’t want an election, but if we have to set a date, it’s going to be after the 31 October,” said a senior government source.Asked if he was denying opposition MPs the time to stop a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister told Sky News: “No, that is completely untrue. We are bringing forward a new legislative programme on crime, hospitals, making sure we have the education funding we need.”In the letter to colleagues, Johnson said MPs would be able to debate his approach to the EU negotiations before the European council on 17 October, at which any new deal would have to be agreed by the EU27 – and to vote on it afterwards.“Parliament will have the opportunity to debate the government’s overall programme, and approach to Brexit, in the run-up to EU Council, and then vote on this on 21 and 22 October, once we know the outcome of the council.“Should I succeed in agreeing a deal with the EU, parliament will then have the opportunity to pass the bill required for ratification of the deal ahead of 31 October,” he said.In practice, given MPs do not sit on most Fridays, they are only likely to lose between four and six sitting days in parliament, depending on which day parliament is prorogued on the second week of September. MPs would have been due to hold conference recess anyway, from 12 September until 7 October.Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that Johnson had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already expected to break briefly for party conferences.Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen’s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen’s speech at the formal state opening of parliament.On Wednesday morning, the Conservative chairman, James Cleverly, confirmed the move on Twitter, saying that planning to hold a Queen’s speech was something that “all new governments do”.Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, called the move “an utterly scandalous affront to our democracy. We cannot let this happen.”A meeting of opposition MPs, convened by Jeremy Corbyn, agreed on Tuesday to let legislative efforts take priority over a confidence vote in the new government as a mechanism to stop no deal – a priority that could be changed given the curtailing of the parliamentary timetable.The proposed new timetable would leave MPs with a far narrower window to pass anti-no deal legislation, cutting it short by two weeks, with new dates likely to be:The UK would be due to leave the EU on 31 October.Rumours swirled in Westminster on Tuesday that plans were afoot to stymie MPs’ efforts to stop no deal after it was revealed that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, would hold a fast-tracked spending review on the day after MPs return to parliament next week, promising a cash boost for schools, hospitals and policing..The swift timing of the review came as the first major speech by the chancellor was abruptly cancelled by the Treasury with less than 24 hours’ notice.A Treasury spokesman said the speech had been cancelled because the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been expected to take place later this autumn, was being fast-tracked.Javid, writing in the Daily , suggested he would not break his predecessor Philip Hammond’s strict fiscal rules, saying the government could “afford to spend more on the people’s priorities – without breaking the rules around what the government should spend – and we’ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police.”The chancellor said his economic priorities were health, education and policing, suggesting that other key areas including housing may get overlooked for major investment.He said: “Health and education aren’t just the names of departments – they’re lifelines of opportunity, just as they were for me. The teachers who persuaded me that I had what it takes to study economics, and put me on the path to becoming chancellor of the exchequer.“The police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up on became a centre for drug dealers. The NHS that cared for my dad in his final days. These aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet. They’re the beating heart of our country.”The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: “Nobody is fooled into believing that this is a proper and normal spending review. It’s a one off pre-election panic-driven stunt budget.Whitehall sources suggested there was considerable concern MPs could trigger a vote of no confidence in the government and an early general election, which could lead to departments being left in the dark about spending plans, with budgets running out in 2020.“We want people to be able to plan and there is a reason it is in early September because of the risks when MPs return to the house that week,” one source said.The 12-month review, instead of the usual three-year review, is intended as a short-term measure to give departments new budgets and also free up officials to focus on preparing for Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94f72fed50880612f14c40bf3c6c010c3f03219d/950_523_963_578/master/963.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e67e6701d13e88d49e36257f8b426ee","title":"eu condemns sinister move to suspend uk parliament","story":"Guy Verhofstadt says five-week suspension unlikely to deliver stable future relationshipEuropean sources have warned that Boris Johnson’s move to suspend parliament for five weeks has increased the chances of a no-deal Brexit, while a leading MEP said: “Taking back control has never looked so sinister.”The plan to suspend parliament for five weeks, which would drastically reduce MPs’ ability to influence changes to the withdrawal agreement or seek a delay, is seen in Brussels as a move to overpower rebels and force through Johnson’s Brexit agenda.The European parliament’s coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, said the move was unlikely to deliver a stable future relationship. “‘Taking back control’ has never looked so sinister,” he wrote. “As a fellow parliamentarian, my solidarity with those fighting for their voices to be heard. Suppressing debate on profound choices is unlikely to help deliver a stable future EU-UK relationship.”EU officials said it heightened the chances of a no-deal outcome, as parliament could refuse to back a compromise presented to MPs, just days before the 31 October deadline.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no over-arching post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Nathalie Loiseau, a former Europe minister, who is a close ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the move showed there was a “disease” in British democracy.“We could see a Brexit without an agreement,” the MEP wrote on Twitter. “It is, moreover, a Brexit without debate that is looming. From what disease is British democracy suffering from that there is a fear of debate before taking one of the most important decisions in its history?”Norbert Rӧttgen, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German Bundestag, sounded incredulous about the move. He tweeted:The request to the Queen was made as Johnson’s Brexit envoy met senior EU officials in Brussels.David Frost, the prime minister’s EU adviser, met officials working for Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, as well as Jean-Claude Juncker’s chief of staff, Clara Martínez Alberola.Frost, a former Foreign Office diplomat who went on to lead the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, replaced Olly Robbins when Johnson took office in July.Before the meeting, Johnson saw EU leaders in Berlin, Paris and the G7 summit in Biarritz – a series of meetings that have injected a new dynamic into talks, according to EU officials.But the move to suspend parliament is now seen as heightening the risk of no deal. It has also been pointed out that it does buy Johnson more time to strike a deal, if there are fewer parliamentary sessions.EU diplomats remain sceptical about whether the prime minister can find alternatives to the Irish backstop – the main stumbling block – that can win over his party.Frost was not expected to put fresh ideas on the table, while the EU is stressing that proposals need to be offered sooner rather than later.Following the meeting between Frost and EU officials, a UK government spokesperson said the UK and EU had agreed to “intensify discussions as of next week”.When asked about Johnson’s declaration that a “blistering timetable” for negotiations existed, a European commission spokesperson said: “I am not aware of any 30 days deadline. Of course, for us, the earlier the better, because our working assumption is that Brexit should occur on 31 October and that should happen with a deal and that is our preferred scenario and the scenario we are working to. So for that to happen, the earlier we see workable proposals, the better.”The spokesperson said Juncker and Johnson had agreed to “continue the dialogue” during a phone call between the two leaders on Tuesday evening.The EU has maintained its readiness to replace the backstop, an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Under the backstop, agreed between the EU and Theresa May, Northern Ireland would continue to follow many EU single market rules, while the UK would remain part of an EU single customs territory.The backstop would kick in automatically if the two sides failed to find an alternative and would apply until new arrangements could be agreed.Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device in the Withdrawal Agreement intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs ide in the Irish sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u0027s customs union permanently if the UK \u0026amp EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.\u0026nbspA legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try and get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.Unilateral statement from the UK\u0026nbspThis set out the British position that, if the backstop was to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.Additional language in political declaration\u0026nbspThis emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it \u0027reduces the risk\u0027 of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.Prime minister Boris Johnson\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspdeclared the Northern Ireland backstop “dead”\u0026nbspduring his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he re-negotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not re-open the Withdrawal Agreement for re-negotiation.\u0026nbspDublin remains sceptical about alternatives that have been circulating.“I think we need to be honest here that the alternative arrangements that have been discussed to date do not do the same job as the backstop, not even close,” said Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, speaking after a meeting with his Czech counterpart on Tuesday evening. “So let’s not pretend that solutions exist when they might not.”In his call with Johnson, Juncker said the EU’s support for Ireland was “steadfast” and that the bloc would “continue to be very attentive to Ireland’s interests”.The UK government has said it is “working at pace to find a wide range of flexible and creative solutions to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/898a42083b5767a31f7737ba3d081f0828c72eaf/0_16_3144_1886/master/3144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53f526221137ccc5e177a020b4def19e","title":"parliament only has itself to blame readers on plans to suspend parliament","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to government plans to suspend parliament in the second week of SeptemberI’m sorry but parliament only has itself to blame for where we find ourselves.

If this goes ahead, by hook or by crook, it gives further credence to (re)forming the constitution and getting rid of the monarchy. Absolute shambles from a cockwomble extraordinaire. Well done, UK. Well done. awaw1283Brexiters, with their alleged love of tradition, might want to reflect on the awful position this is putting the Queen in. I’m personally agnostic on the royals, I don’t think they have any significant role in our governance, and they probably attract tourists, so fine I don’t have problem with them. However, if the Queen was drafted in to support this coup, that would be a different story. OldSynnerWhat an absolute travesty. If a government can’t get parliament to support it the correct route is a general election. The precedent this would set is abominable. GavinlBellIf Elizabeth Windsor has any sense, she’ll realise that the game is up. Sitting on her hands is no longer a viable option. It’s quite obvious that during the latter part of her reign, Britain has gone from being an out-of-date democracy, to a completely broken one. Clearly it doesn’t help that it also has a broken government, and a broken opposition, but contagion spreads. That might not be entirely her fault – the media and our politicians have clearly played a significant part – but unless she steps in and prevents Johnson’s destruction of British democracy, she’s going to go down in the history books as the monarch who failed the country. Time for a written constitution, and for the entire political system to be overhauled. BlueThirdWhat this government is doing is an anti-democratic coup, pure and simple. If the scarcely believable reports this morning are accurate, it will show (i) the weaknesses wrought by lack of a written constitution, and (ii) further evidence (if any were needed) of the utter uselessness of the monarch as any kind of democratic safeguard. Anyone who wondered what defences this country had against an authoritarian executive has their answer. There needs to be legislation andor a vote of no confidence in the week beginning 3 September. And MPs like Rory Stewart, Gubb, Lee, Letwin and Grieve need to put their money where their mouths are. This is democracy at stake. hendchard11Unbelievable is all I can say. The UK is going down the same road as America where one half of the country hates the other half. If this goes ahead and parliament is shut down, it will surely rank amongst one of the worst abuses of power in any modern democracy. You can absolutely kiss the union goodbye with this and the further result of this will be a humbled England that is a vassal state of America. Shocking events at one level and disgusting at another. andrew_arrow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2a77229383ecc01d6eac1813587d23310b2955/257_93_3104_1862/master/3104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ed30e84eaa13ef26e79517258e0f991","title":"pms plan to suspend parliament aimed at evading scrutiny of mps","story":"Hansard Society director calls move an ‘affront to democracy’ designed to evade scrutiny of Brexit planBoris Johnson’s plan to prorogue parliament for five weeks is the longest suspension of the British legislature since 1945 and appears designed to evade scrutiny of his plans for Brexit or any new deal with the EU, constitutional experts have said.Ruth Fox, the director of the highly respected Hansard Society, a leading source of independent research and advice on parliamentary affairs, said it was an “affront to parliamentary democracy”.The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has said the move was an “offence against the democratic process” designed to stop MPs debating Brexit.Lawyers said the unprecedented length of the suspension of parliament would prompt immediate legal challenge. “Expect litigation – starting in Scotland,” said Ros Kellaway, the head of Brexit and EU law at Eversheds Sutherland, in London.The prorogation could also have consequences for Northern Ireland, where a no-deal Brexit could increase the threat of direct rule from Westminster.The lengthy gap between the end of the last scheduled parliamentary session, on 9 September, and the next sitting, on 14 October, compares with a “three to seven day gap” in the last decade, said Fox.“The decision to prorogue parliament is not unconstitutional but the length of it is unprecedented in recent times. If the government wants a new Queen’s speech it could bring one forward on the usual week to two-week timetable for prorogation.“In the current Brexit context, anything longer than this is clearly designed to help the government evade parliamentary scrutiny.”Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen’s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen’s speech at the formal state opening of parliament.Meg Russell, a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe initiative and the director of the constitution unit at University College of London, said: “What he’s doing, frankly, is hiding from parliamentary scrutiny: denying MPs the opportunity to question him and to hold him to account, and potentially denying them the opportunity to express no confidence in him.”She continued: “He’s daring MPs to vote him out of office.“If our constitution has one overriding principle, it’s parliamentary sovereignty: the government only is the government because it has the support of parliament.“Boris Johnson was prime minister for not much more than 24 hours when parliament broke for the summer recess. He has faced no parliamentary scrutiny for the entire period since then.“We’re looking at an unprecedentedly long prorogation, at a time when we are in the middle of the biggest political crisis since the second world war, and the prime minister has only been in office five minutes. It’s putting the Queen in a very difficult situation.”Hansard said the last time there was a prorogation for longer than two weeks was in 2014, when parliament was suspended for 14 days. But this included time off for EU parliamentary elections and Whitsun recess.Johnson’s supporters argue the five-week gap is needed to develop new legislation. Parliament is already in the longest-running session since 1945 because of the logjam created by Brexit.However, Hansard says suspending parliament will deny democratic scrutiny as ministers will not have to account to parliament and select committees, which have been vital in investigating the consequences of Brexit.“On their return in October MPs will have very little time to scrutinise any new deal with the EU, if there is one, or little time to scrutinise the remaining statutory instruments that the government may need for a no-deal Brexit,” said Fox.Bercow, who has said he will “fight with every breath in my body” to stop Johnson from proroguing parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit without the consent of MPs, said: “However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country.“Shutting down parliament would be an offence against the democratic process and the rights of parliamentarians as the people’s elected representatives.”Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, said the move did “seem like a very obvious move to try and cut down the time available to anti-no deal MPs to be able to do something about it”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a717776960721f5fcae9304c1da8c329fd3ad1/0_52_1962_1177/master/1962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d4f5132cf1eadc8cdb4281cbd5fba6a","title":"spending review set for next week fuels election speculation live","story":"Government will prorogue parliament in September, with Queen’s speech on 14 OctoberRuth Davidson is expected to quit as leader of the Scottish Conservative party because of her irreconcilable differences with Boris Johnson over Brexit and the pressures of motherhood.Scottish Tory sources said an announcement was imminent.

Davidson has made abundantly clear during the Tory leadership campaign she did not believe Johnson was the right UK party leader. One of Johnson’s first acts as prime minister was to sack her close friend and ally David Mundell, who served as Scottish secretary for five years.Severin Carrell, the ’s Scotland editor, has confirmed reports that Ruth Davidson is on the verge of quitting, in part over her differences with Boris Johnson.

I simply want the government to recognise that the majority is opposed to a no-deal Brexit.”Ruth Davidson is to quit as leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, according to a report in the Scottish Sun.Quoting “insiders”, it says she is stepping down “due to the pressures of motherhood”.Davidson became the first UK party leader to have a baby while in office when she gave birth to a boy at Edinburgh Royal infirmary last October.We’d like to hear from people who are taking to the streets to protest against the prorogation of parliament.

A legal team acting for Joanna Cherry and 74 other MPs and peers expect to be in court in Edinburgh this Friday morning to urge Scotland’s civil court, the court of session, to block the proroguing agreed today by the Queen. They had already won approval for a full hearing of their legal challenge to Johnson’s proroguing strategy on Friday 6 September next week. They will now ask the court to hear that case early next week, following Johnson’s gambit on Wednesday.Jolyon Maugham QC, the anti-Brexit lawyer who helped coordinate the legal challenge through his Good Law Project, said they believe the courts are able to reverse the decision even though it has been approved by the Queen:The MPs’ lawyer, Aidan O’Neill QC, is expected to attack Johnson and the privy council’s request of the Queen on Wednesday rather than the Queen’s decision to approve it. O’Neill will argue the court can order UK ministers to request that the Queen reverses the prorogument, again via the privy council. Either side is likely to immediately appeal against the judge’s decision whichever way it goes, leading to series of urgent court hearings likely to end up at the UK supreme court.  Meanwhile, the European Movement in Scotland held a demonstration against Johnson’s “coup” in central Edinburgh on Wednesday.We’ve just launched a piece by Jessica Elgot providing answers to some of the key questions around the complex events of today. You can read it in full, but here are two:Prorogation is a formal mechanism to end a session of parliament, normally lasting only a short time until proceedings begin again with a new Queen’s speech. It means parliament’s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion.It is normal for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years.No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However, proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way.Jacob Rees-Mogg has been doorstepped at Aberdeen airport where journalists followed him through the terminal after his privy council meeting with the Queen.“Anything the Queen says is private, as you know,” said Rees-Mogg, who was one of three members of the council who went to Balmoral to ask permission on behalf of the prime minister for the prorogation of parliament.Asked if he was confident that the move would not be up for challenge in the courts, he replied: “The courts will come to their decision but this is a completely normal procedure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/267ef3497bf741bdbb61069f8b3a9391dc28bedc/0_278_5700_3421/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2203799798ec1b589f081d216d1210a","title":"1 5bn fewer cigarettes smoked each year since 2011 study finds","story":"Nearly 1.5bn fewer cigarettes have been smoked each year in England since 2011, research has found.A study, funded by Cancer Research UK and published in the journal Jama Network Open, found average cigarette consumption fell by nearly a quarter between 2011 and 2018, with approximately 118m fewer cigarettes smoked each month.The team at University College London (UCL) examined cigarette sales data as well as the monthly self-reported cigarette use from more than 135,000 people in the Smoking Toolkit Study.The lead author of the study, Dr Sarah Jackson from UCL’s tobacco and alcohol research group, said: “It’s brilliant that over a billion fewer cigarettes are being sold and smoked in England every year. Studies like this help to give us an accurate picture of cigarette consumption so we know where we’re at and what more needs to be done.”The researchers suggested the decline in consumption was encouraged by stricter laws on marketing and advertising of tobacco, designed to encourage people to quit smoking.Over the past 20 years there have been multiple policy changes affecting the sale of tobacco, including the ban on billboards and print adverts in 2003, the indoor smoking ban in 2007 and the branded packaging ban in 2017.Cancer Research UK said there was more to be done as it called for funding from tobacco companies for stop-smoking services and treatments.The charity’s senior policy manager George Butterworth said: “It’s great news that fewer cigarettes are being sold and smoked.“Big tobacco said that introducing stricter regulation wouldn’t work and campaigned against it but this is proof that smoking trends are heading in the right direction.“But smoking is still the biggest preventable cause of cancer and certain groups have much higher rates of smoking, such as routine and manual workers, so we can’t stop here and think: ‘Job done.’”He added: “Last month, the government committed to making the UK smoke-free by 2030. But stop-smoking services, which give smokers the best chance of quitting, have been subject to repeated cuts in recent years.“We need the government to fix the funding crisis in local stop-smoking services. The tobacco industry could be made to pay for these services to clean up the mess their products have created.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ddd7d76a4d2969208d9ca7d7950e1d17da3e8cd/579_38_1758_1055/master/1758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8122a16ead249047c832034fe1d5c08c","title":"we need to talk about the menopause as loudly as we can says campaigner","story":"Campaigner, who was once a fixture on the Britpop scene, had no idea what was going on when she became perimenopausal“I consider myself a woman of the world and I didn’t know what being perimenopausal was,” says Meg Mathews, the former music PR. But since launching a blog about the menopause in 2017, she has become a prominent campaigner on the subject.Mathews believes the subject is not discussed as much as it should be. “We need to talk about the menopause as loudly and as much as we can because we have to get past the stigma and shame our society places on the menopause,” she says. “We have to break the taboo.”Now 53 and on hormone replacement therapy, Mathews started going through her menopause at 49, although she now thinks she was perimenopausal in her early 40s. It hit her hard, but she had no idea what was going on.“The only thing I knew about the menopause was hot flushes and no more periods – but I wasn’t getting those two symptoms,” she says. Mathews later found out through her own research that she had been suffering 32 of the 34 lesser-known symptoms of menopause, including burning mouth, mood swings, problems sleeping, hair loss and low libido. Her GP prescribed her antidepressants to no effect.The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.\u0026nbsp“But I couldn’t tell anyone: my mum had recently died, so I couldn’t talk to her, and we all know about ‘Meg Mathews’ rock and roll lifestyle’,” she says, referring to her reputation as a fixture on the 1990s Britpop party scene – she was married to Oasis’s Noel Gallagher for four years. “I thought it had all caught up with me,” she says. “I told everyone I had glandular fever and didn’t go out of the house for three months.”Then, at an AA meeting, she stood up to tell the room that she thought she was going mad. “A woman approached me afterwards, saying that I wasn’t going mad I was having my menopause. I went to an NHS menopause clinic, which I didn’t even know existed, and the light switched on. I was like, ‘Oh God, I have had all those years feeling like this – why isn’t it talked about?’”Making sure the menopause is talked about has become one of Matthew’s driving forces. In 2017, she started a blog about the menopause. It features articles and Q\u0026ampAs from menopause specialists, real-life experiences – including her own – and lists of products Mathews says have helped her.The blog has been a runaway success, with a million visitors in its first six months. “I’ve held two conferences in London with a range of the country’s best specialists talking on a wide range of topics. For the second one, in May this year, the tickets sold out,” she says.Mathews has given talks in unlikely places, including at the Foreign Office’s services ision: “They opened the phone lines to every embassy and Commonwealth office around the world so that they could listen in, too,” she says. “It went so well that they invited me back to their main office in Milton Keynes to talk to their employees there.”She has spoken at the British Library and the BBC, and is in discussions to speak at another government department.This, says Mathews, is just the start. “I want to take my conferences nationwide,” she says. “I want to help women create a sisterhood network, like Weight Watchers, where they meet weekly in a village hall-type setting to discuss their symptoms and swap advice because many women don’t have anyone to talk to – we’re in a bubble in London. I have learned everything just through my network of women.”Mathews plans to lobby the government for trained nurse practitioners to act as the first port of call for women experiencing menopausal symptoms – and to persuade writers of soaps to include a menopause storyline.“There have been storylines about paedophiles, rape, murders and drug addiction, LGBT issues – but they have never had Bet Lynch behind the bar having a hot sweat,” she says. “Soaps play a pivotal role in helping to start conversations within families on a national scale. So many women probably don’t know how to explain to their husbands what’s going on. But if it was on a TV show as a storyline, it’d be ‘look at what’s going on in EastEnders, she’s got the menopause!’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

Billed as an international multi-sport women’s festival, the event brought together roughly 150 athletes, including Olympic champions and grand slam winners, to compete for Team Americas and Team World in tennis, gymnastics, basketball, ice hockey, figure skating, beach volleyball and table tennis.The mission of the Games, founded by longtime sports executive Jerry Solomon, was to create a platform to celebrate and elevate women athletes. The Aurora Games will be held every two years and has already committed to return to Albany for 2021 and 2023.At a time when women in sports are fighting for equitable pay on the soccer pitch, an end to sexual assault in gymnastics and more professional leagues in ice hockey, the Aurora Games set out to establish a new bar for the production of women’s sports. Whether it succeeded is an open question.The most urgent topics in women’s sports today have been pay equity, creating a professional environment and visibility. It would be difficult for the Aurora Games to successfully be a progressive women’s sporting event without the participating athletes being compensated appropriately.Team Americas ice hockey coach and Aurora Games advisory board member Digit Murphy told the  that ice hockey contracts were set at $2,500 and covered travel, meals, accommodations and other expenses.“They worked for four to five days and they got compensated handsomely. All their expenses are paid, all the bills are paid … we felt that it was a good number. We felt like it was more than they’re getting paid for a month of the season, for a weekend.”Many of the players participating in the Aurora Games played in the now defunct Canadian Women’s Hockey League or the National Women’s Hockey League. In the 2018-19 season, women’s pro hockey salaries in North America ranged from $2,000 to $10,000 dollars for a seven-month season.Murphy noted she was asked to keep her equipment budget under $10,000, but did not know exactly how much was spent on the ice hockey events. Requests made for the details of the athlete contracts, including compensation, were not offered at the time of publication.Women athletes largely agree pay equity is a process as opposed to a concrete destination. En route to larger salaries, women are also fighting for work conditions appropriate for world class athletes.“My first metric is the athletes. If the athletes say to me, ‘Hey, thanks for doing this, but this is a stupid idea. No one’s ever gonna play this again.’ That’s not a good metric. The feedback from the athletes so far has been exactly the opposite. That they’ve been really appreciative … they’ve been talking about how great of an idea it is, how important it is how, how happy they are, to be part of it to be part of the first one that is really meaningful.”Athletes have expressed the same sentiment.American figure skater Mirai Nagasu added, “Growing up, I was told ‘I can’t do that because I’m a girl.’ I should stick to Barbies and dolls and that’s not always the case. I preferred bugs and throwing myself and taking really hard falls. Skating is a little like parkour with a lot more glitter … we put sunglasses on how hard we work. We make it look easy, that’s our job. But it’s really cool to be a part of something focused on women and females.”However, there have been a few things that were not in line with creating the best athlete experience. For starters, the equipment for the first several events, most notably gymnastics and basketball, were damp from the condensation the arena ice created.During Thursday’s basketball shootaround and evening event, towels were placed near the benches and camera crew areas so no water made its way onto the court. During the ice hockey open clinic, a participating athlete noted there was “a lot of work” needed to get the ice to decent condition. The athlete also expressed concerns for the ice along the boards.There were also reports that the beach volleyball participants were not scheduled to have practice time until the day of their event, which had an 11am start time. Reports indicated the players were not originally offered an alternative practice area but that one was secured Saturday.Some of these issues were likely due to all six events happening at the same arena in six consecutive days. Albany has already been secured for the 2021 and 2023 Aurora Games. However, Solomon may rethink having all the events in the same arena.“We probably need to be outside of one building,” Solomon said ahead of Thursday’s basketball event. Albany was not a first-choice destination, but was the best choice at the time. While the idea of having all the events in one building was tempting, it proved difficult.Another lesson from the inaugural Aurora Games is that visibility for women’s sports remains an issue. Part of that is drawing on a more global market, Solomon said Thursday. Even if the Aurora Games was able to offer competitive contracts, and could offer a better venue experience for next time, did they do enough to draw in media attention in the first year?To combat that, the Aurora Games partnered with ESPN in their first year. In May, the network announced it would air coverage from all six nights on ESPNU and ESPNews.Print and online media covered the Games as well, but the press corps on hand for the events Thursday through Saturday was sparse. Some told the  they felt the Aurora Games could have done a better job drumming up media attention.The Aurora Games had consistent local coverage and national American outlets such as espnW and The Athletic covered Lindsay Whalen, the coach of the Team Americas basketball. CBC and the Wall Street Journal, and The  also covered the sports festival. The latter two questioned whether the Games would be successful in drawing crowds.On Sunday, the event announced they drew an overall attendance of 20,423 over six nights, or an average crowd of approximately 3,400 for each session. The Times Union Center has a maximum capacity of 17,500 with the lower bowl seating 6,000 fans, according to the Wall Street Journal.Murphy was pleased with the crowd of 2,851 fans that watched Team Americas defeat Team World in tennis on Friday night. The lineups included Rogers Cup champion Bianca Andreescu, former world No 1 Victoria Azarenka and two-time major champion Garbine Muguruza.The biggest crowd of the week was for women’s gymnastics, as 4,210 watched American gymnast and viral sensation Katelyn Ohashi scored a perfect 10 on the floor exercise to help Team Americas to the victory.“I feel great. I think that it’s a start. There’s a lot of men’s teams that would like 2,000 people at their events that are just starting … I think generating the buzz and excitement, it was very well done,” she said.Solomon added: “Success, or lack of success, for the Aurora Games can be measured in a lot of different ways, and by different people in different ways … Here tonight, you’ll see a basketball game. The one thing we know, they’re great athletes, they’re going to put on the best show that they can. And, you know, if you like basketball, you probably gonna have a good time tonight. But there’s not gonna be a lot of people in the stands. And so, you know, the critic will say, ‘See, there’s no market for this.’”Solomon was right: it wasn’t a great crowd. There were just over 2,500 fans on hand to watch Team World edge out Team Americas, 85-77. However, that will not convince him the event wasn’t a success.“I went to the first Super Bowl. It wasn’t sold out. The tickets were cheap. And if somebody had said, well, 50 years from now, the Super Bowl is going to be the biggest thing on the planet. It would have sounded stupid.“The Aurora Games are named after the Roman goddess of the dawn. And Rome wasn’t built in a day. And so I think there are a lot of people who are very, very excited about what we’re doing. And I think that we’ll sort of see how it all goes.”Drawing a conclusion as to whether the 2019 Aurora Games was successful is complicated. Criticism of the attendance and venue challenges is fair. So too is Solomon’s “let’s wait and see” approach.Ultimately, the six-day festival held this year is a baseline. It is natural for media to question the success of an event by clear-cut metrics like attendance, ticket sales, viewership and profitability. As of now, we only have the attendance numbers.It is worth noting that the 2019 Aurora Games sought to do something that has never been done and they were successful in that. One could measure the volume of attendance, sponsors or salaries for events in one of the six sports to gauge success. However, that is an apples to oranges comparison. Of course, the Olympics is the closest analogue to the Aurora Games, but with a 119-year head start. Not to mention, it includes men and women.Solomon sees the Aurora Games as an idea whose time has arrived. Eighteen years ago, he was approached by a group wanted to start a linear 24-hour women’s sports network. Solomon didn’t believe 2001 was the right time, but the idea stuck with him. By 2016, she began to see an opportunity to host a women’s sporting event like none other.“I really saw this as, this should be a platform for women athletes that shows what they’re all about, because they’re great. And they’re entertaining. And they’re personable, and they have stories, and their role models … but they get lost in the comparison to the men and in the bigness of the men,” he said.The ‘bigness’ Solomon is referring to all revolves around money. The average baseball team, a sport many believe to be struggling to keep fans, is estimated to be worth $1.78bn. Alternatively, an owner could buy a women’s professional softball team for $250,000 and operate a franchise for roughly $1m, according to sports economist David Berri.As of yet, we don’t know if the Aurora Games made a profit or operated at a loss. It is also unclear if Solomon has fully detailed how to measure success of the first-of-its-kind event.However, the baseline has been set. The Games recruited over 150 athletes, secured over 20 sponsors, and drew an overall crowd of 20,000 fans. With 2019 as a guidepost and with the city of Albany already committed for two more games, Solomon and his team must move the needle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feb8c66c4238338f2a97c54ed6dbf40770f69302/473_378_1483_890/master/1483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7544b5b272df3e9ebb567973c60f942f","title":"mako vunipola injury world cup japan tongo italy jack nowell","story":"Mako Vunipola, whose injury was the sole blight on England’s record 57-15 demolition of Ireland at Twickenham, has a small tear of scar tissue in his hamstring that will need 10 days of rehabilitation to heal, meaning he will miss the final warm-up game before the World Cup.His likely recovery for the World Cup will be a huge relief for Eddie Jones as his England squad fly out to Treviso to continue their preparations for the tournament in Japan next month with a final warm-up match, against Italy on 6 September at St James’ Park.Ben Moon has been called up to Jones’s squad as a temporary replacement for Vunipola, who needed surgery to reattach tendons after tearing his hamstring for Saracens in May.Vunipola’s prognosis may be welcomed by the England camp but Jack Nowell’s chances of playing in Japan are “touch and go”, according to his club coach, Rob Baxter. The 26-year-old wing injured his ankle in Exeter’s Premiership final defeat by Saracens in June, but was included in England’s 31-man squad.“I think he’s going to be touch and go for involvement in the World Cup,” Baxter told BBC Radio Devon. “But let’s cross our fingers and hope that he can come through.”After facing Italy, England fly to Japan on 8 September. They begin their campaign against Tonga on Sunday 22 September.New Zealand have named their World Cup squad without the Northampton prop Owen Franks. The tighthead, who has played 108 Tests for the All Blacks, is replaced in the front row by the 24-year-old Atu Moli of the Waikato Chiefs.Also failing to survive Steve Hansen’s cut is the powerful centre Ngani Laumape, with Anton Lienert‑Brown, Sonny Bill Williams, Jack Goodhue and Ryan Crotty preferred.

Jimmy Anderson and Steve Smith are likely to return from injury: England’s best bowler and Australia’s best batsman. Smith will renew his duel with young pace sensation Jofra Archer, who could challenge for Anderson’s title sooner rather than later.Smith will first play in a tour match against Derbyshire after Archer concussed him with a short ball during the second Test. Their battle in the fourth will be at least as anticipated as whatever Stokes does next. But ahead of time, Smith was in no mood to be deferential to his opponent.“There’s been a bit of talk that he’s got the wood over me, but he hasn’t actually got me out,” said Smith of Archer. “He hit me on the head on a wicket that was a bit up and down at Lord’s. All the other bowlers have had more success against me, I daresay. I’ve faced them a bit more, but they’ve all got me out a lot more.”As for a short-ball attack, Smith replied archly. “If they’re bowling up there it means they can’t nick me off, or hit me on the pad or hit the stumps. With the Dukes ball – I don’t know, that’s an interesting ploy.”Smith certainly didn’t back away that day at Lord’s, repeatedly hooking Archer before one kept low and hit him on the side of the neck. There was alarm as Smith fell forward onto his face, like when batsman Phillip Hughes was fatally hit on the back of his neck during a domestic match in 2014. It wasn’t only onlookers who thought of that moment.“I had a few things running through my head, particularly where I got hit,” said Smith. “That was probably the first thing I thought about. Then I was like, ‘I’m OK here’. I was a bit sad, but I was alright mentally for the rest of that afternoon.”Smith’s concussion has started a broader conversation around safety. While making the point that a neck protector would not have prevented his injury, Smith said that he would have to get over his sense of claustrophobia when wearing one on the assumption that they would soon become mandatory.As for the fact that he initially resumed his innings before being diagnosed the next day with concussion, he noted the complexity of such situations. “I felt pretty good, passed all my tests and was able to go and bat and then it wasn’t until later that evening that it hit me.Plenty of time is ominous for England, given Smith looked utterly unhurried through his Ashes innings of 144 and 142 at Edgbaston, before Archer ruffled him towards the end of his 92 at Lord’s.“Edgbaston was just: first game back, fresh, and I just wanted to bat, I didn’t want to stop batting… All my movement patterns and the way I feel was really good so I’m comfortable with that, and hopefully I can ramp up my training over the next few days.More than anything, you could sense Smith’s impatience to be playing, after both agonising over and admiring Stokes’ matchwinning performance. “He completely turned the series on its head,” said Smith. “Even if you go back to two nights before, when he bowled 14 overs straight. I rocked up to the ground next day and someone said that on average he bowled the quickest for the day as well, over those 14 overs.”“You could just see the passion that he showed and the fight. He never gave up. You look at him, and I really admire this about him, when he scored a hundred he didn’t even celebrate, didn’t care. He had one thing on his mind and that was getting England over the line.”With the series now locked at 1-1, getting over the line is all that Smith has on his mind too. After a year’s suspension, another match spectating was the last thing he wanted. Now the most prolific of run-gatherers is ready for his next haul.Meanwhile Cricket Australia have played down suggestions that spinner Nathan Lyon could miss the fourth Ashes Test with an ankle injury. The Australia camp confirmed on Wednesday morning that the 31-year-old has picked up an ankle issue, but did not seem to think it would affect his involvement at Old Trafford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9bc282eb5b6748a5089d24db08eb3c91e8fa937/0_76_2393_1436/master/2393.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee0532f17c49cb415b64b6d9711e0d25","title":"lewis hamilton alexander albon f1","story":"Having enjoyed his best opening 12 races, Lewis Hamilton is in position to seal his sixth world championship with his most successful season. That the title, which will move him above Juan Manuel Fangio and behind only Michael Schumacher, is in his grasp is beyond doubt. He has already won eight races, to lead his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas by 62 points, and Hamilton usually only improves on the run-in. Last year he won four of the first five races after the summer break nine races remain, starting with this weekend’s Belgian grand prix, and with four more victories he will have surpassed his previous best of 11 in a season. Hamilton has been explicit in insisting he is taking nothing for granted yet he is in the form of his life and motivated as never before. Closing out the championship by leaving the opposition scattered and reeling will be his target as Schumacher’s record seven titles looks eminently reachable next season.This time last year Formula One looked a world away for the London-born Thai driver Alexander Albon. Yet when racing resumes he will make his debut for Red Bull in his rookie season after only 12 F1 races. He was set to compete in Formula E’s 2018-19 season until a late call-up to Toro Rosso. He has impressed there and as Pierre Gasly fell apart at Red Bull they unexpectedly promoted the 23-year-old Albon into a race-winning car, alongside the intimidating No 1 driver, Max Verstappen. With few alternatives on offer and Red Bull desperate to have a driver to back up Verstappen at the front, a strong performance could secure Albon’s place for next season and beyond. He was impressive in coming up to speed at Toro Rosso with little preparation and the Red Bull should suit his smooth driving style. Albon has an opportunity most drivers can only dream of how he faces the challenge will be fascinating.After a process that began soon after Liberty took over the sport in 2017, the end-of-October deadline for signing-off new regulations for 2021 looms large. Delayed once this year already, the plan devised by the director of motor sports, Ross Brawn, intended to improve the racing could not be of greater import. What is agreed will shape the sport and what has already been a tortuous process is likely to become increasingly tense as the days count down. Several midfield teams have warned the proposals are in danger of being watered down by the leading marques, who want to maintain their advantage. Equally, a new concorde agreement between competitors and Liberty has yet to be signed for 2021. Confidence in how competitive they can be under the new regulations will play a part for the smaller teams in those negotiations, with Gene Haas already warning F1 has to make sporting and financial sense if teams such as his are to remain. This is the first vital test for F1 in the Liberty era.Mercedes have swept into the distance in the constructors’ championship, 150 points clear of Ferrari, but behind them every race is vital. Ferrari are still struggling with their car and winless, while Red Bull are snapping at their heels thanks to Verstappen’s two victories. They trail the Scuderia by 44 points and the Dutchman is third, ahead of Sebastian Vettel, in the drivers’ championship. Verstappen and Red Bull clearly sense Ferrari blood in the water. The team have gone from strength to strength and if Albon can perform where Gasly failed, they could take the fight for second to the wire. Behind them McLaren are a team reborn with Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz revelling in their competitive car. They are fourth in the championship, 39 points in front of Toro Rosso and 43 in front of Renault. After the turmoil of recent years they look to be firing collectively, reminiscent of the team that once towered over the sport. Holding fourth would be their best finish since 2012 but it is far from a given a tooth-and-nail scrap may well define the midfield run-in.Jockeying in the drivers’ market will begin in earnest when racing resumes at Spa. The decision that will likely set the dominoes in motion is whether Mercedes will drop Bottas for their protege Esteban Ocon as Hamilton’s partner. Toto Wolff, the team principal, said they would consider it over the summer and it seems likely they will announce their choice, now expected to be to stick with Bottas, at Spa. There is considerable trading still to be done, however. The Red Bull drive might yet be open should Albon not make the grade and, although highly unlikely, a return to his former team has been rumoured for Vettel, despite the German being contracted with Ferrari until the end of the 2020 season. Romain Grosjean at Haas, Antonio Giovinazzi at Alfa Romeo and Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg are all out of contract and the last of these is expected to be replaced by Ocon should Mercedes retain Bottas. Racing Point are likely to stick with Lance Stroll and Sergio Pérez, as will Williams with George Russell, but the latter will likely replace Robert Kubica with their reserve driver Nicholas Latifi. McLaren have already confirmed Norris and Sainz for next season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16eaa395ed007785d95e710a62d1b119a2594d9a/0_85_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14c0c6c15122f5fb99de7f871e8352e","title":"shock and bore how dave chappelle lost his comic touch","story":"In his controversial Michael Jackson-defending, trans-attacking Netflix special, the once-groundbreaking comedian shows his power has been diminishedIt all goes back to Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor, or at least the reputation they left behind as a legacy. The two continue to inspire up-and-coming comedians due to their lionized status as embattled truth-tellers, men whose jokes were so searingly incisive about human hypocrisy that the culture’s tongue-cluckers couldn’t handle the truth. Bruce in particular stands today as something between a rock star and martyr, the angry young subversive with a tight fifteen so powerful that the squares had to put him in handcuffs and drag him off the stage. At the time, rabble-rousers like Bruce and Pryor knew they were doing something right when people got angry at them. They prided themselves on it, in the knowledge that shaking the foundations of the old guard – their religion, their etiquette, their sexual hangups – made their voices vital and exciting.This is almost certainly how Dave Chappelle sees himself, judging from the material and delivery in Sticks and Stones, his fifth stand-up special recorded as part of his twenty-million-a-pop deal with Netflix. He opens with an epigram from Kendrick Lamar, triumphantly declaring, “Tell me somethin’  you mothafuckas can’t tell me nothin’  I’d rather die than to listen to you.” It’s a defiant middle finger extended in the direction of the critics, notifying whatever haters may have tuned in out of perverse curiosity that he will not be deterred by their words. Indeed, Chappelle has come under fire as of late for saying things he should not say, the very same charge that Bruce and Pryor were slapped with decades earlier. But only if a person thinks about the ire directed at these provocateurs that broadly, with no mind to the specifics of their respective situations, does the comparison hold up.A single moment’s consideration would reveal that there’s a big difference between Lamar telling the hosts of Fox News that he won’t be their talking point in bad-faith conversations about the societal effects of hip-hop, and Dave Chappelle taking potshots at the transgender community. Trans people – referred to as “the Ts” in an extended run about “the alphabet people” that make up the LGBTQ community, as if Chappelle will melt like the Wicked Witch of the West if he even says the word – really take it on the shins, but they’ve got plenty of company. Chappelle speaks out against Michael Jackson’s accusers, stating in no uncertain terms that “I do not believe these motherfuckers” to whistles and cheers of approval from the audience. An assortment of his hotter takes plays like an exoneration wishlist: Kevin Hart’s a good guy, Louis CK never did anything wrong, and even if the King of Pop did prey on innocent children, “I mean, it’s Michael Jackson.”Chappelle likes to play sheepish when airing what he knows will be his more polarizing opinions, repeatedly doing the classic “drop the punch line, throw your hands up, and walk upstage” bit to playact stepping away from the fallout of his jokes. He puts on the Bugs Bunny gee-ain’t-I-a-stinker face as he qualifies with transparent sarcasm, “Far be it from me to offend anybody!” He even gives the timeless defense of the indefensible and mentions more than once that he has gay friends, perhaps in the hopes that they will form a protective phalanx around his ideas.The public hailed Chappelle as a shit-stirring seer for so long, and for the most part rightly, that he cannot part with that image of himself even as it rapidly sours. In the worst-case scenario, this trajectory ultimately sends him the way of Ricky Gervais, currently locked in an increasingly sweaty campaign to get a rise out of his audience with the same tired jabs. That’s the most meaningful front on which Sticks and Stones fails for all his power to offend, Chappelle has utterly lost the power to shock.The predictability has been the most dispiriting part about watching the master lose his touch over the past couple of specials. Excepting one little tease facetiously implying that he may have had sex with a fourteen-year-old, none of the lines raise an eyebrow. We’re locked into a routine, both the performer and the critical corps professionally obligated to take his bait, his transgressions every bit as preordained as our objections to them. Even for someone uninterested in pondering the particulars of who he’s making angry and why, Chappelle’s got to recognize another major difference between his predecessors and himself in their reception. Those familiar with his recent output click into the newest knowing full well what they’re in for, leading to the same restricting self-selection of opinion that one might otherwise find on Fox News, Chappelle’s secondhand enemy left unnamed in Lamar’s quotation. Forefathers like Bruce and Pryor reveled in infiltrating the mainstream with beliefs so progressive about sex, race, and culture as to be dangerous. Chappelle would rather retreat into his niche as an old crank, where all is expected and safe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7255fb86e59e9abc21db47cdc477e4928517f61/10_285_2124_1274/master/2124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ea83c358bb72f3b45f943c9948e8d59","title":"apple ends contracts hundreds workers hired to listen siri","story":"At least 300 contractors in Europe sent home after ‘grading’ project suspendedHundreds of Apple workers across Europe who were employed to check Siri recordings for errors have lost their jobs after the company announced it was suspending the programme earlier this month.More than 300 employees have had their contracts ended in the company’s Cork facility alone, according to former employees, with more sent home from other sites across Europe.The staff had been on paid leave since 2 August, the day Apple announced its decision to suspend the programme, referred to as “grading”, as it conducted “a thorough review”.The decision followed a story in the  that revealed the workers frequently heard confidential medical information and couples having sex while checking the Siri recordings.The graders, employed through contracting firms, were sent home that Friday, with many told there was no work for them due to “technical errors”.However, last week the contracting firms were told by Apple that the grading work would be terminated, leading to the mass job losses with little notice.Even among those employees who were concerned by the ethics of the programme, there has been anger about how the job losses have proceeded. “I’m relieved this information came out,” said one former contractor who asked to remain anonymous due to a still-active non-disclosure agreement, “although I was involved in the work and I just lost my job. Discussions around ethics in this job was a constant between workers, but we don’t know how to bring it up.”But, they added, “Apple, recruiting through vendor companies in Ireland, take absolutely no responsibility in the employment of contractors and their treatment in work. They do what they want, and when they’re done with your project or they screw up (like what just happened), they tell your vendor company to let you go, which they do … It’s been coming at them for over a year. How could they not see this coming? Did they think about protecting their employees at all? Or just their reputation?”“We’ve all been laid off after the scandal, with no protection against this. More than 300 at once just in Cork, with no redundancy, just one week’s notice.”The next software update to iOS, the operating system that runs iPhones, is expected in early October and was likely to be the first occasion where the company would have been able to implement a promised opt-out to the Siri grading system. The job losses suggest, instead, that Apple is not planning to resume the grading project in the immediate future.Apple did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f84497bc9de67b670c7e67e2fe32c2cab139a42/0_0_1436_862/master/1436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe960be271d89f5ef6bf57d3641fac26","title":"australian who says he invented bitcoin ordered to hand over up to 5bn","story":"US court orders Craig Wright to share cryptocurrency haul with the estate of American programmer David KleimanThe Australian man who claimed to have invented cryptocurrency bitcoin has been ordered to hand over half of his alleged bitcoin holdings, reported to be worth up to $5bn.The IT security consultant Craig Wright, 49, was sued by the estate of David Kleiman, a programmer who died in 2013, for a share of Wright’s bitcoin haul over the pair’s involvement in the inception of the cryptocurrency from 2009 to 2013.Kleiman’s estate alleges Wright and Kleiman were partners, and therefore his family is entitled to a share of the bitcoin that was mined by the pair in that time. Wright denies there was a partnership.A US district court in Florida on Tuesday ruled that half of the bitcoin mined and half of the intellectual property held by Wright from that time belongs to Kleiman.One issue is it is not known exactly how much bitcoin Wright holds. It has been claimed that the Kleiman estate could get anywhere between 410,000 and 500,000 bitcoin, putting the value at between A$6.1bn and A$7.4bn as of Wednesday.Wright claimed to the court that he couldn’t access the bitcoin because he doesn’t have a list of the public addresses of that bitcoin. He claimed in 2011, after seeing the cryptocurrency had begun to be associated with drug dealers and human traffickers, he put the bitcoin he mined in 2009 and 2010 into an encrypted file and into a blind trust. The encrypted key was ided into multiple key slices, and the key slices were given to Kleiman who distributed them to people through the trust.Wright said this meant he could not decrypt the file until he gets access to the key from a bonded courier who will arrive in January 2020 – a claim Wright has made before in claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.In the judgment, Judge Bruce Reinhart said Wright had not proved he could not comply and obtain the bitcoin. He said Wright made inconsistent statements and the whole story was “inconceivable” that he’d had a Dr Frankenstein-like revelation when his creation “turned to evil”.“During his testimony, Dr. Wright’s demeanor did not impress me as someone who was telling the truth. When it was favorable to him, Dr. Wright appeared to have an excellent memory and a scrupulous attention to detail. Otherwise, Dr. Wright was belligerent and evasive,” Reinhart said.In 2015, Wright was investigated by the Australian Taxation Office over his involvement with bitcoin with his Sydney home raided by the Australian federal police, leading to speculation he might be Nakamoto.In 2016, Wright claimed he was Nakamoto, but experts questioned the evidence he provided. He promised to provide further proof, but backed down days later, saying he was “sorry” and did “not have the courage”.Reinhart said at the start of his ruling the court “is not required to decide, and does not decide” whether Wright is Nakamoto, and the court was not required to decide and did not decide how much bitcoin Wright controls today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/833edc16435de60d406f1a7367fc5f25b02be4c9/0_205_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eec257a2b3ea255833e8a11875b9221","title":"mix it up the mixologists guide to drinking rum","story":"Still drinking gin? Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

The location is intricately entwined with the creation of their signature dark spirit, whose full name – Jack Ratt’s Lugger Spiced Rum – comes from infamous smuggler Jack Rattenbury.“Reading Jack’s book, Memoirs of a Smuggler, it just spoke to us, as it’s what we’re all about. There’s cheekiness, innovation and that sense of trying to be a little bit roguish – we just felt his character suited so well what we were trying to do with the rum,” says Lambert. In true Rattenbury form, the winery is not afraid to venture into the unknown. “We have a bit of an obsession with all things ‘off the beaten path’, says sales manager Sara Walters, who has worked at Lyme Bay for 10 years. “The fact that there was no one in Devon making a spiced rum made for an irresistible challenge, particularly given our rich smuggling history.”Taking inspiration from these tales, Lyme Bay embarked on its own voyage of discovery. It created a bottle design to convey the spirit of Jack Rattenbury – a black label to match his black-painted boat, and rakish typography – all the while showcasing the winery’s trademark elegance.Upon arriving in Devon, this exotic import is aged in a solera system, where it matures alongside older versions, aged up to six years. After years spent in charred-oak bourbon barrels from Tennessee, the rum is ready to provide the base character for Lugger Rum, bringing with it hints of caramel and molasses to give a complex and superior taste.The second spirit added to the blend is a premium Guyanan rum, “from the homeland of demerara sugar,” says Lambert. But if the mention of sugar sets your teeth on edge, don’t worry: this rum offers a soothing kiss of natural sweetness without having to add excessive amounts of sugar.Spices complete the symphony. Nutmeg, stem and ground stem ginger, cinnamon, orange peel, clove and vanilla are introduced to create an inviting yet complex flavour combination. “The intention was always to make a high-quality spirit,” says Lambert. “Many commercial spiced rums have an overpowering vanilla essence, but it was important to us to follow a more craft approach.” For Lugger Rum, they mellowed out the vanilla tones to bring forward the natural flavours of both rums, re-enforcing them with a distinct array of spices.That’s all well and good, but one imagines that the rum’s namesake would ask only one question: “How do I drink it?” Although the combination of rums with the charred-oak barrels has created a dark spirit that’s flawless in cocktails or with simple mixers, I like nothing more than three large ice cubes and a nice splash on the rocks. Sourced from afar, yet aged on our doorstep – and sitting at a refreshingly mid-tier price point – Lugger Rum is ideal for those who want something a little special in their glass.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

These tales of infamous men – whose names have endured for centuries – bring to mind the smell of woodsmoke and sea salt, and warming brown spirits sipped from battered tin mugs.And so to Lyme Bay on the unspoilt Jurassic Coast of England’s south-west, where the fossilised remains of ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs lay waiting to be discovered under the sand and shingle. For more than 100 years smugglers in this area, such as the notorious Jack Rattenbury, would paint their rickety little “lugger” boats black and pack them full of contraband to sell to the highest bidder.Fast forward to today, and these romantic scenes have given way to a vibrant, brilliant mix of influences. Nowhere is this blend of cultures more evident than in the food and drink we have on offer across the UK. Whether it’s Turkish meze or Korean fried chicken, chances are you’ll be able to find it here. In terms of food and flavours, Britain’s multiculturalism has always been a string in our bow, and for Lugger Rum – which is made in Devon’s Lyme Bay Winery – this international twist is essential to a modern-day rum.Lugger Rum seamlessly blends complex flavours and spices to create a rounded, subtly complex, yet richly flavoured sipping spirit. Here’s how:The Caribbean connectionTake your windswept Devon coastline and add Trinidadian and Guyanese rum, aged in charred Tennessee barrels to add smoky, vanilla notes. The resulting spirit pulls back on the sweetness thanks to the unique style of these aged rums, unlike many of the commercial, more confected varieties.Spice it upCloves were lauded by Chaucer and Shakespeare for the unique flavour they imparted to ales and pies, and Elizabethan royalty would use them in pomanders to mask unsavoury bodily aromas. During the spice wars of the 17th century ships went to great lengths to bring these spices to our shores.Nutmeg, highly sought after for its curative and mildly hallucinogenic properties, as well as its culinary ones, used to be worth more than livestock per kilogram. Britain couldn’t get enough of this exotic flavour, and using it became a sign of wealth. Now they’re two of the spices found in Lugger Rum.The Mediterranean twistLugger’s flamboyant, citrus peel kick on the finish harks back to Plantagenet times, when expensive deliveries of oranges from the Mediterranean would be requested by Edward I’s Spanish wife, Eleanor of Castile, to remind her of home. Their beguiling scent permeated London’s theatre scene during Restoration England, when oranges were sold to theatregoers by wenches such as the infamous Nell Gwyn, who became Charles II’s mistress.Lugger Rum is the result of centuries of British history and the inquisitive, innovative minds at Lyme Bay Winery. Here is a team who have been helping lead the surge in quality and discovery of English wines, and are now turning their hand to fine spirits. Their rum is a nod to all the delicious things that made the British food and drink scene what it is today, as well as the notorious smugglers who managed to supply more illegal brandy and rum to the West Country than was ever legally imported into the capital. The finish on Lugger Rum is sure to be a little smoother, however, than the contraband hooch dragged up the beach from those little lugger boats.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

In a December 2014 court filing she alleged that she was made to have sex with Andrew and other friends of Epstein.The prince has always vehemently denied the allegations. In 2015 a court decided that the allegations made by Giuffre about the prince were “immaterial and impertinent” and ordered them to be struck out of a claim against Epstein.On Tuesday, Giuffre, who now lives in Queensland with her Australian husband, spoke to reporters outside federal court in Manhattan. She was one of nearly two dozen women who spoke about alleged sexual abuse by Epstein during a unique court proceeding scheduled after the financier’s death in prison on 10 August, which was ruled a suicide.Epstein’s death at 66 brought an end to his criminal case but the judge gave accusers the opportunity to speak publicly.“He knows what he’s done and he can attest to that,” Giuffre said about Prince Andrew, a video of the press conference showed. “He knows exactly what he’s done, and I hope he comes clean about it.”Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing a number of Epstein accusers, said that “with respect to Prince Andrew or anyone else who made statements, gratuitous statements, if anyone wants to come over here and talk with us, and answer real questions that the victims have, and that we have on their behalf, we welcome that invitation.“I personally extended that invitation to Prince Andrew multiple times. Any time, we are ready, and we have a lot of questions for him.”Andrew said in a statement last Saturday that he made Epstein’s acquaintance in 1999 and saw him once or twice each year. The prince also said he stayed at several of Epstein’s homes.The prince also said: “His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.“This is a difficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epstein’s lifestyle. I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/457776340f8907a2a6e7f1afaba3fb95343b5b8c/0_238_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b637ae15540110c21389a7e0d558e0e","title":"cathay pacific denounced for firing hong kong staff on china orders","story":"City also sees separate rally against alleged sexual violence by police against participants in protest movement Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Hong Kong on Wednesday to denounce Cathay Pacific for firing staff after it came under pressure from Beijing – describing the case as symptomatic of the wider intimidation of protesters and sympathisers. Businesses, pushed to voice support for the authorities, are facing a growing backlash from employees and customers who see the pressure as part of a broad strategy to wear down opposition after two and a half months of protests sparked by a controversial extradition bill. Protesters, many from the aviation industry, rallied in the financial district before marching to the headquarters of Swire Pacific, the airline’s controlling shareholder.Later on Wednesday night thousands of protesters attended a separate rally against alleged sexual violence by police against participants in the movement.The arrested pilot was sacked and the airline’s chief executive, Rupert Hogg, quit – news which, strikingly, first emerged in Chinese state media. Last week, the chair of the flight attendants union at the subsidiary Cathay Dragon said she had been sacked after managers presented her with copies of protest-related Facebook posts the Confederation of Trade Unions plans a legal challenge. Cathay, which said that the measure was not related to her union activities, reiterated before the rally that it upheld Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms but had a zero-tolerance approach “to any support for or participation in illegal protests, violent activities or overly radical behaviour”.The pressure on the firm was unprecedented, said David Webb, a shareholder activist and founder of Webb-site, which reports on Hong Kong affairs, adding that he was dismayed rather than surprised by the outcome. “Inidually I understand why companies don’t speak up. Collectively they should,” he said, suggesting chambers of commerce should take a stronger stand.Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, described the extent of the pressure on companies as a “turning point”.Last weekend the MTR rail system closed stations along protest routes for the first time. The company and the Hong Kong government – its majority shareholder – said it was simply protecting staff and passengers, but activists noted that the decision came shortly after mainland state media accused it of having “arranged special trains for rioters to escape” and asked whether it was “an accomplice to rioters”. Though the business community was hostile to the extradition bill, some tycoons have recently emerged at pro- government rallies. Some protesters are boycotting the restaurants, stores or shopping malls of such figures as a result. But for many businesses, the calculation is simple. Around a fifth of Cathay’s business is thought to be to the mainland – where Swire also has substantial interests – and almost all other flights pass through its airspace.Even people rallying against Cathay admitted they did not expect it to reverse its policy. “Of course we won’t change its mind – but it’s also sending a message to other companies that we cannot let this white terror spread,” said Marcel Chan, who works in the transport industry.Many fear that retaliation will be even more likely when the protests eventually end, with companies and institutions pushed to marginalise participants or let them go.“If we don’t protest now we won’t be allowed to in future,” said a teacher who had turned out to support the aviation workers. “They want to control education, too.”Universities have long been under pressure. On Wednesday the overseas edition of the state-run People’s Daily accused some Hong Kong teachers of planting radical ideas in the minds of students and said those with “no ethics” should be sacked.Meanwhile thousands of protesters overflowed from a park in the central business district on Wednesday night to rally against police harassment of female protesters arrested at anti-government demonstrations.Many in the female-dominated crowd scrawled #protesttoo on their bodies in lipstick while others donned purple ribbons and waved purple lights in a sign of solidarity with women who say they have been groped by police officers or abused in detention over the past three months.Headlining the rally was a female protester who at a press conference last week publicly accused police of indecent assault. She described how she had been aggressively strip-searched after her arrest. The woman said she had then undergone a humiliating cavity search by two female officers only to discover a handful of male officers were waiting immediately outside, according to Hong Kong Free Press.The protester spoke of her intense shame during the encounter. She did not disclose her identity, was dressed in a mask, sunglasses, hat and black sweatshirt, and asked for reporters to refer to her by a pseudonym – reflecting the fact that sexual harassment and gender-based violence remain largely taboo subjects for many Hongkongers.There have only been a handful of public #metoo cases in the conservative city in recent years the most high-profile case, of the athlete Vera Lui, ended in acquittal for her coach after she accused him of sexual assault.Police violence, however, appears to have begun a city-wide conversation about sexual harassment, as both men and women carried signs with slogans such as “Stop Hong Kong police’s use of sexual violence!”Wednesday’s rally was the first event to specifically target women since demonstrations began in early June.“I would say our culture is ‘women should stay behind and guys to the front’, so I hope this is an opportunity for us to stand out internationally,” said protester Aqua Wong, who had scrawled #protesttoo on her chest above her black outfit.Other protesters reiterated their calls for an independent inquiry into police violence. While the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, has promised a fact finding study into police tactics, she has failed to deliver on public demand for a formal inquiry led by a judge.Protester Pas Lek said she thought it was “fishy” that the government had failed to set up an independent review despite social media posts and videos of women being mistreated, including a widely shared clip of a woman whose skirt was pushed up exposing her genitals as she was aggressively arrested.Mass protests began in Hong Kong on 9 June against a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to stand trial in mainland China. Many protesters felt this bill would infringe on the city’s autonomy, promised until 2047, under the “one country, two systems” agreement with Beijing.Protests, however, show no sign of ending even after Lam promised she would not move forward with the bill.

After the end of the conflict, Khangoshvili moved back to Georgia where he was employed as a mediator by the anti-terror unit of the Georgian interior ministry. He continued to help the Chechen insurgency and continued to be regarded as a terrorist by Russia’s intelligence agency, the FSB.From his base in Georgia, Khangoshvili helped to send supplies over the mountains into Chechnya and to evacuate wounded fighters, his associates said. However, they insisted he was not a radical or an Islamist. “He was always against Chechens going to fight in Syria or Afghanistan he thought our only battle was with Russia,” said Saikhan Muzayev, who knew Khangoshvili from Georgia and saw him in Berlin three months ago.A suspect named in the German media as Vadim S was arrested by Berlin police before he could leave the scene of the crime on an electric scooter parked in a nearby bush.Two 17-year-olds had reportedly seen the man throwing a Glock handgun with a silencer, a bicycle and a wig into the river Spree and alerted the authorities.Ekkehard Maaß, a former East German dissident songwriter who now chairs the German-Caucasian Society, said he had met Khangoshvili when he first arrived in Germany at the end of 2016 and had personally appealed to the authorities in January 2017 to grant him special protection.Khangoshvili arrived in Germany after six months in Ukraine, having fled Georgia after surviving two assassination attempts there, one by poison in 2009 and one where he was shot at eight times while driving his car in central Tbilisi in May 2015, said Maaß.“Zelimkhan thought that now he was in Germany he would be safe, and every Friday he took the same route from his home to the mosque. He must have been noticed, and the information passed to the killer,” said Maaß.Khangoshvili, who lived in Berlin under a pseudonym, had three daughters and two sons aged between two and 17. A small memorial was held in Berlin on Tuesday before his body was flown back to Georgia. Muzayev, who attended the ceremony and took part in the Chechen ritual of washing the body before the funeral, said he saw one bullet wound in the shoulder and two in the head. “He was shot in the shoulder and fell to the ground, and then he was finished off,” he said.When he was caught by the police, the alleged assassin, a 49-year-old Russian citizen from Siberia, had changed his outfit to blend in as a tourist, wearing a pink shirt, sandals and a neck pouch containing a passport and a large amount of cash.A rucksack that police recovered from the river contained a shaving kit and paprika powder, which can be used to throw sniffer dogs off a scent.Vadim S, who had only arrived in Berlin a few days before the killing, has denied responsibility for the killing and reportedly refused to answer questions. According to Bild, the suspect requested to speak to a representative of the Russian embassy.On Wednesday the Kremlin denied any involvement in the killing, which took place on the same day that Germany’s foreign minister was visiting Moscow. “I categorically reject any link between this incident, this murder and official Russia,” said Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.There have been numerous contract killings of Chechens across the world in recent years, with the victims usually falling into one of two categories: personal enemies of the region’s Kremlin-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, or figures believed to be involved in an insurgency against Kadyrov’s forces and Russian troops in the region.In the former set of cases, Chechen murder squads linked to Kadyrov have appeared to be the most likely perpetrators, while the latter hits have borne the hallmark of the Russian federal security services. There have been a number of murders in Istanbul, one of which in 2009 used a Groza pistol, developed for Russian special forces and rarely found on the open market.While Chechens have been shot with impunity in Istanbul, Dubai and Moscow, it is rare for such killings to take place in broad daylight in western Europe. The closest parallel to Khangoshvili’s killing is the murder of Umar Israilov in 2009, who was shot dead as he left a supermarket in Vienna. Israilov, a former Kadyrov bodyguard, had fled the republic and made allegations of torture against Chechen forces and Kadyrov personally.Last year the former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned in Salisbury. Police identified two Russians as the suspects.Citing unnamed sources, Der Spiegel said German security agencies were increasingly confident Russia’s signature could be detected behind Khangoshvili’s killing. “If it turns out that a state player like Russia is behind this, we have a second Skripal case on our hands, with everything that entails,” the magazine quoted one source as saying.Maaß said: “I see this as a message to all the Chechen refugees in Germany: you’re not safe here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e71db12a977df2bf5d2e6b8d77ffe67971024d0/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=551e4ff3b77c25a55e28b5ef9a550fb9","title":"russia pushing unsuitable nuclear power in africa critics claim","story":"Moscow aiming to win influence by wooing African states with nuclear energyRussia is attempting to gain influence in Africa and earn billions of pounds by selling developing nations nuclear technology that critics say is unsuitable and unlikely to benefit the continent’s poorest people.Representatives of Rosatom, the Russian state corporation responsible for both the military and civil use of nuclear energy, have approached the leaders of dozens of African countries in the past two years.The company, which is building a $29bn reactor for Egypt, has concluded agreements with Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, South Africa and others. Winners of an Africa-wide competition were rewarded with an “educational” trip to Russia that included visits to a nuclear power plant and the “science city” of Obninsk. Rosatom is among international groups that are exporting light-water technology, which is generally considered among the safest, and is building a $13bn light-water reactor in Bangladesh. But such reactors typically generate more than 1,000 megawatts and very few countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the capacity to distribute that amount of power.Nuclear power’s supporters argue that the lengthy construction times of nuclear reactors allow poorer countries to build up their infrastructure. But Névine Schepers, a nuclear expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, said light-water technology was not suited to many African countries.“In terms of economic sense smaller countries that have a long way to go to develop their grids would be better off aiming for something like smaller modular reactors,” she said.Technology for cheaper reactors that would produce about 300MW is being developed in Russia, China and the US.Another concern is that the expensive projects favoured by Rosatom would not benefit Africa’s poorest people. In most countries energy is generated in large, centralised plants and distributed over a national grid – a model that would be reinforced in Africa by nuclear power.“Access to energy is a basic human right and necessary for a dignified life. The majority of those denied this right live in Africa,” said Friends of the Earth. “However, the expansion of profit-driven nuclear energy in Africa would only exacerbate the problem.”The environmental NGO said the answer to Africa’s energy needs lay in “efficient technology that meets the daily needs of people, in the hands of communities and municipalities, and controlled democratically”. Only small-scale and interconnected grids that were democratically managed could deliver energy sovereignty to African people, it added.Rosatom has accused Friends of the Earth and other NGOs of “hardline anti-nuclear activism … based on a position well known for being completely biased and riddled with factual errors”. It said its priority was “sustainable development” and that nuclear energy was “intrinsically immune to any form of political manipulation”.Selling nuclear technology is part of an effort by Russia to build influence, power and trade across Africa, with growing involvement in nations across the continent.The involvement of Russian mercenaries in the Central African Republic and Sudan has attracted significant attention, as has an apparent effort to influence elections in South Africa in May.Many of the African countries that have signed commercial agreements of the kind being pursued by Rosatom are run by movements or iniduals who have long-standing relationships with Russia or – more often – the USSR.In early April João Lourenço, the president of Angola, visited Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin and top officials, to discuss arms sales, diamond mining, and gas and oil production. Russia delivered six Su-30K fighter jets to Angola this year and two more are expected in the second part of a billion-dollar deal. Lourenç, who fought in Angola’s war of independence against Portugal, studied in Moscow from 1978 to 1982. Angola was a cold-war battleground and the USSR backed the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, still the ruling party.Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, said “reactivating old Soviet networks” had been a clear strategy in Moscow for a couple of years. “The old history can play very positively in some places.”Patrick Smith, editor of Africa Confidential, an investigative newsletter, said: “Russians can’t write big cheques but have mastered the art of making themselves really popular, albeit with some of the worst leaders in Africa. They want the ties too. The more powers they can play off against each other, the better.”The campaign has had setbacks. A deal in South Africa went wrong when Jacob Zuma was  removed from power amid corruption allegations last year. A furore surrounding a $75bn contract to build power stations with a combined 9.6 gigawatt output badly damaged the image of Russia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de56cfd27de0c4ab3b2ee1d11ff931dc2eb8bf07/0_55_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e78850958d35d699b5e25ef97da1e63","title":"tropical storm dorian puerto rico latest","story":"Puerto Rico faces a potential threat to life and property as Tropical Storm Dorian was bearing down on the island on Wednesday, with a warning of wind gusts of up to 90mph in place until early evening.As the storm approached, Donald Trump insulted and taunted the island and its residents, who are US citizens, on Twitter. “Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth” he wrote in part. “Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. And by the way, I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to Puerto Rico!”“Now is the time to shelter from dangerous wind,” the warning advised. There was also potential for storm surge flooding up to 2ft above ground. A flash flood watch from anticipated rain was also in effect.Roberto García, the director of US National Weather Service San Juan, said on Tuesday: “Practically the entire island will be under sustained tropical storm-force winds.”From Puerto Rico, the storm was expected to turn north and sweep to the north-east of the Bahamas through Saturday, and then approach the east coast of Florida as a hurricane on Sunday, where it could potentially arrive as a Category 3 storm. A hurricane watch was also in effect for the US Virgin Islands.Trump declared an emergency on Tuesday night and ordered federal assistance for local authorities in Puerto Rico. But in a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump, a climate crisis denier, seemed to complain about Puerto Rico’s exposure to storms, and escalated a long-running feud with Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico’s capital.The two established a combative relationship after the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria almost two years ago, when US aid was slow to arrive and the president offended many during a visit. On Tuesday night, Cruz said that Trump should “get out of the way”.“Three thousand Puerto Ricans did not open their eyes this morning because this racist man did not have it within him to do his job,” Cruz said on CNN. “So get out of the way, President Trump.”Cruz was referring to the death toll from Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico in September 2017. An official report criticized the Trump administration’s slow response to the devastation from the storm, which destroyed the island’s power grid and decimated its agriculture and tourism industries.On Tuesday morning, Trump had tweeted about Dorian, and seemed to complain about the cost of hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, which have fallen far short of restoring the island.“Wow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico,” Trump wrote. “Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for ‘anywhere’.”Trump’s tweet contained multiple falsehoods. While Congress has allocated $42.5bn for disaster relief for Puerto Rico, the island had received less than $14bn through May, according to federal data. And in any case Trump’s headline amount of $92bn would not qualify the Maria relief package as “an all-time record” for the costliest tropical cyclones, according to the federal government’s own figures. Spending on recovery for Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana in the same storm season as Maria, has so far cost $125bn.Since Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled with political turbulence leading to the recent departure of the governor, Ricardo Rosselló.

Rebel soldiers drive past their roadside bread ovens daily. A spectre of violence remains. Regardless, Yvette Abaka and her female baking collective make dough and roll with it.In this impoverished, rebel-held corner of the Central African Republic (CAR), this group of mothers came together last year to better their lot. Since then, their loaves have become a hit in the wider community, promoting the women as their families’ breadwinners and promising further, quietly profound, change.“This bakery makes us more powerful than before,” says Abaka, the group’s leader and a 50-year-old mother of two. “My husband respects my work. Now I am his equal.”In this turbulent country, scarred by years of conflict, Abaka’s bakers are not the only people hoping for something good to come out of the troubles. Following a major ceasefire brokered earlier this year between the government and 14 rebel militias, groups of women are coming together across the nation to reinforce the grand strategy for peace at a community level. They are rebuilding their country from the ground up, forging formidable sisterhoods in the ashes of a protracted conflict.High rates of sexual violence, maternal mortality and teenage births have made CAR one of the worst places in the world to be a woman. But now female activists, displaced mothers and survivors of rape have joined forces to heal deep wounds and restore trust between opposing ethnic factions as part of an ambitious attempt to mend a broken country in the heart of Africa.Besides Abaka’s bakers, another group called Femme Debout (“Woman Standing”) is defying religious tensions by bringing together Christian and Muslim widows in Bangui, CAR’s capital, teaching them commercial skills and helping traumatised iniduals recover collectively. Elsewhere, in camps for displaced people, where people shelter from militants who use sexual violence as a weapon of war, survivors enrol with associations to fight the stigma of rape and to cultivate hope.“Such groups are vital forces for social change,” says Viola Giuliano, a researcher in CAR for the Center for Civilians in Conflict, an NGO focused on civilian protection. “They are uniquely placed to find and prioritise solutions and enable a sense of ownership of the peace process, which is key for sustainable, long-term reconciliation.”Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIn the northern village of Bamingui, lead baker Abaka is familiar with such horrors of war, having survived six years of it. In 2013, an alliance of mainly Muslim rebels assembled close to her village before running amok through the rest of the country, committing atrocities and seizing power in a bloody coup d’etat. In response, “anti-balaka” militias consisting of Christians and animists rose up and carried out revenge attacks against Muslim communities.Increasing waves of violence killed thousands, displaced more than a million people and prompted warnings from the United Nations of an impending genocide. The rebel coalition has since fragmented into numerous armed groups competing over territory and access to mineral reserves.Among the many fatalities was Abaka’s son. Her brother, aunt and grandfather also perished in the bloodbath. Today, gunmen from the same rebel group that killed them frequently drive past her home and bakery. While the militants’ presence has taken on a surreal air of normality, Abaka’s war-weary community – like others nationwide – fear this uneasy truce could shatter at any time.“At first the kids were scared of all these weapons, but now they’re used to it,” she says. “But I do worry that the war will begin again. We’ve already lost so much. We cannot afford for it to happen again.”Despite these concerns she presses ahead, along with seven friends, with what they do best. They rise at dawn and congregate to scrub baking trays, gather large logs, chop up kindling and light fires in the kilns. Beneath a tin roof, they knead dough into hundreds of rolls. Small ones sell for the equivalent of 7p, a medium one for 14p, a loaf for 35p. Any profit is split between the women, allowing them to buy key household items and reinvest the remainder.Revenues are modest the impact, big. With almost half the country affected by acute food shortages and several regions teetering on the brink of famine, food production for malnourished communities is crucial. The bakers sell to local Muslim families, bringing once-ided communities together to intermingle in the marketplace.“This bakery is the only opportunity we have to make any money by ourselves,” says Estella Yarsara, Abaka’s fellow baker and a 27-year-old mother of five. “This work means I have some extra food for my children too. I do this to help myself and to help my family. We all want to lift up our community.”The job has upended a conservative hierarchy, helping Yarsara challenge her role in society: “If I have some money and my husband does not, I can intervene and support him. It is making our relationship more equal. I don’t have to depend on him. I have more strength in the family.”Their bakery opened last September, kickstarted by an EU-funded initiative. While this programme was focused primarily on wildlife conservation in the nearby Bamingui-Bangoran national park, officials were keen to reach out to the wider community. In addition to the bakery operation, other locals are taught how to farm guinea fowl, produce shea butter and air-dry beef in order to reduce an unsustainable dependence on bushmeat.Reverent Yakoudou, a park manager, knows the value of this investment: “Women are more reliable with money. They use all their profits to look after their family and reinvest in the business.” Abaka’s vision for the bakery’s future confirms this. She hopes eventually to open up a permanent shop, selling their bread among many other products: “That way we can help our children and our community even more.”Although separated by hundreds of miles of rebel-held roads, Abaka would find a sister in arms in Florence Atanguere, who runs the Femme Debout women’s association for widows and orphans in Bangui. Many of its members have suffered displacement and witnessed extreme violence, yet despite the war’s isions along religious lines, Christians and Muslims are welcomed alike.Supported by UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, the group meets every week on the edge of the capital to discuss their difficulties and successes. From sewing to soap-making, they are taught new skills, helping them foster solidarity and a boisterous, entrepreneurial spirit.“Little by little women are getting together to fight back,” says Atanguere, a mother of six who saw her brother stabbed to death when rebels stormed her neighbourhood in late 2013. She fled to a squalid camp for displaced people and eventually returned home three years later, founding the association with the women she met there. “We are sisters. We are all Central Africans. It doesn’t matter whether you’re Muslim or Christian. Here, we are all equal.”While the worst of Atanguere’s ordeal is over, more than 600,000 people remain displaced within CAR, with a similar number uprooted as refugees outside the country. Many of the women have been raped by militants. Yet among these exiled communities, there is resilience and a restless desire to rise above such harrowing circumstances.One of them is 18-year-old Céleste, who was five months pregnant when rebels attacked her village in northern CAR late one night. Gunshots and the roar of motorbikes woke her. “They raped many girls and tortured many men,” said Celeste, just 15 at the time of the attack. She wasn’t spared either. Four soldiers entered her house, each taking turns to rape her: “My pregnancy was visible but they still did it anyway.”Afterwards, she fled her village and hid in the bush for several days, surviving on whatever she could find to eat. Her distress was amplified by memories of what she had lost. Before the war, she had enjoyed helping her father farm cassava, okra and peanuts, participating at school as an enthusiastic dancer and eager pupil. Now, forced from home, her sense of helplessness grew when she learned a few days later that her fiance – the father of her unborn child – had been murdered in the course of a car-jacking.Céleste, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, eventually made it to a displacement camp on the outskirts of a rebel-held town called Kaga Bandoro. She moved into a cramped tent where she saw out the last few months of her pregnancy but could not shake off the psychological and physical pain of the attack. “Sleeping at night has been hard,” she said softly. “It is difficult to forget. I miss my fiance terribly.”Yet even in this overcrowded and perilous camp, where armed groups freely operate, Céleste has started to overcome this nightmare. A friend introduced her to a women’s association where fellow survivors of rape enter a shared process of mutual healing and, together, tackle the stigma of sexual violence.“I now feel that I have the strength to deal with what has happened,” said Céleste. “The pastor at church teaches us to forgive, let go and move on. During therapy sessions, we can express ourselves. We talk about what has happened and discuss any problems that we still face.”Céleste and her fellow members are keen to return to school. Their dream: to take up midwifery and help pregnant mothers receive the care that war and poverty have denied them.In spite of the camp’s dangers and dreadful conditions, her son is now two years old and in relatively good health. With her country edging towards greater stability, Céleste clings to the hope of a life beyond their tiny, dusty tent – for now, the only home her child has ever known.• Jack Losh is a journalist, photographer and filmmaker with a focus on conflict, conservation and humanitarian issuesThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The CAO issued 74,657 round one offers to 51,513 applicants earlier this month but the round two offers are usually in the low thousands.Applicants should carefully consider their options and to be mindful of this Friday’s 5.15pm deadline (August 30th) by which an offer must be accepted.CAO communications officer, Eileen Keleghan said: “Many of the applicants receiving a second round offer today may have already accepted an offer in Round One, and it is important that they take the time to decide between these courses and inform CAO before the reply date of this Friday, 30 August at 5.15pm if they wish to accept the new offer.”Accepting a lower preference course in an earlier round does not prevent appplicants from receiving an offer in a subsequent round of a course higher up on their course choices list - if they are deemed eligible although accepting the new offer will automatically cancel the previous acceptance.“If this is an applicant’s first offer they can choose to accept this offer and this will not prevent them from receiving a higher preference course in a later offer round if they are deemed eligible,” Ms Keleghan said.“It is important to note, however, that the majority of offers have been issued at this stage and this may be the only offer that they will receive,” she added. Applicants who are unhappy with the course they have been offered, or those who have not received any offers, can check the “Available Places” facility on the CAO website .

A man who was elected by fewer than 100,000 members of the Conservative Party, he suspends parliament.“Why does he do that? In order to pursue his horrible ideological plans for our country to crash out of the EU without a deal, in the face of the facts and there is no debate about this. He has no mandate, whatsoever, to do that,” Ms Soubry said.“I actually feel the need to apologise to your listeners for what the United Kingdom is doing. It’s an absolute disgrace, there is no precedent for it, and there is no justification for it either.”When asked did she suspect that he would do this, she replied: “yes, that’s what we’ve been talking about over the summer, this was debated during the leadership contest of the Conservative Party, and Johnson wouldn’t rule it out.“There’s been legal action by way of example in the Scottish courts, so of course we anticipated this, but I’m also afraid to have to say this, but Boris Johnson has a very fine record for at best being disingenuous, telling fibs and lying to the British people. On the one hand he says there’s a one a million chance of us leaving without a deal, and then in the next breath he says it’s do or die, we’re definitely leaving on 31st October,” she said.“We’re in a national crisis, you don’t just suspend parliament, we’ve just had five weeks of recess.”Ms Soubry said she and others are working on a cross-party basis to explore all options “to make sure that parliament continues to sit and that parliament will do its job of scrutinising the preparedness or otherwise ensuring that the Good Friday Agreement is upheld and remains in place and we will also do everything that we can to stop us crashing out of the European Union.“We will push legislation to stop this as long as people have the courage to be true to what they believe in and put the country first,” Ms Soubry said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Sinéad Flanagan qualified as a  doctor in May of last year after It’s a good year for the Roses and an even better one for Crescent College in Limerick. The Jesuit school that produced such distinguished alumni as the pioneering minister for education Donagh O’Malley, the former chief justice John Murray, broadcaster Terry Wogan and actor Richard Harris has now triumphed in the two guilty pleasures of the summer, Love Island and the Rose of Tralee. Three weeks after Greg O’Shea became the joint winner of Love Island, his fellow past-pupil Sinéad Flanagan was crowned the 2019 Rose of Tralee. She was three years ahead of him in school. It was a great early birthday present for Dr Flanagan who will turn 28 on Thursday. She only qualified as a doctor in May of last year after a circuitous route which involved eight years of study, four as a physiotherapist in the University of Limerick and four more years in University College Cork. She confesses to not knowing her right from her left, but she still managed to win the Dr HH Stewart Medical Scholarship in medical microbiology in UCC in 2016. She is now working as a locum junior doctor in a hospital in Mallow, handy training for the sleep deprivation which comes with being the Rose of Tralee where a round of early interviews are scheduled for the morning after the night before. She has long been a fan of the festival and says she used to cry when the ballad, The Rose of Tralee, was sung after the winner is announced, but was overwhelmed with shock that she couldn’t cry on Tuesday night after her victory. Once again the bookies were uncannily accurate. She was the bookies’ favourite and her odds were quoted at 74. “People had mentioned it in passing,” she said. “I find it hard to believe that anybody knew us well enough to know what was happening in that sense.“We weren’t looking at our phones. We were just living in the moment with each other.” She also missed the fuss surrounding the comments made by Newstalk host Susan Keogh who said the festival was not representative of modern Irish women and went on to inquire as to where were the fat women, the homeless women, the women from direct provision in the festival. Dr Flanagan’s predecessor Kirsten Mate Maher condemned the comments in trenchant terms describing Keogh as an “attention-seeker” who was ignorant of what the festival was really about. Dr Flanagan is slightly more diplomatic. She said the 32 women who were in the live final were a representation of “what it means to be Irish. It’s a celebration of family and of friendship. Just speaking for myself, I would like to think I was a modern Irish woman. For me it is definitely representative of me and 31 fabulous girl from all kind of professions and family.” She hopes to carry on working and carrying out her duties as the Rose of Tralee. a selection of the best pictures from this years International Festival  "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4000285.1567010276!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"toir%C3%A9asa ferris to resign council seat and focus on family","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tToiréasa Ferris with her father Martin Ferris and her son Séadhna.

Sinn Féin politician Toiréasa Ferris has announced that she is to resign her seat on Kerry County Council and leave politics.Cllr Ferris (39) is to vacate the seat next month having been a member of the council for 16 years after being co-opted following the election of her father, former IRA figure Martin Ferris, to the Dáil. She was returned to the council at the 2004 local election and has retained a seat ever since. She was the second woman to serve as mayor of Kerry. Cllr Ferris earlier this year ruled out attempting to succeed her father by standing as Sinn Féin’s candidate in the Kerry Dáil constituency, citing medical advice. Mr Ferris (67) has said he will not seek re-election and on Wednesday told Radio Kerry the party would be seeking someone new to take up the mantle in Kerry. He said the party had huge talent in its ranks and a number of councillors and other members with excellent track records.Cllr Ferris, a married mother of two who lectures in law, said she intended to devote more time to her family after she leaves the council. She did not rule out returning to politics in the future.Cathal Foley, a former Tralee town councillor, is expected to be co-opted to replace Cllr Ferris on the council.

Tadhg Dennehy, Sinn Féin chairman in Kerry, paid tribute to Cllr Ferris, saying the county and party were losing a fine elected representative. “I know this was an extremely difficult decision for Toiréasa to make but the party fully understands her reasons and respects her decision,” he said. “It will be a huge gap for the party to fill but we will now take steps to find a replacement over the coming weeks.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4000187.1567008184!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit timetable key dates up to uk s planned exit on october 31st","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A protester depicting British prime minister Boris Johnson outside the gates of Downing Street on Wednesday.

Photographer: Mark KauzlarichBloombergA woman who alleges she was a victim of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and claimed she was forced into a sexual encounter with the Duke of York has urged the royal to “come clean”.Virginia Giuffre was speaking to reporters after a hearing for alleged victims of the disgraced financier and said Prince Andrew, a son of Queen Elizabeth, “knows what he’s done”.Since Epstein’s death, there have been a number of reports about his relationship with the duke, including that the pair travelled together on Epstein’s private jet with teenager Virginia Roberts, now known as Giuffre.Mrs Giuffre has claimed in court papers in Florida that she was forced to have sex with the duke when she was aged 17, under the state’s age of consent.Her allegations, which the duke denies, were struck from US civil court records in 2015 after a judge said they were “immaterial and impertinent”.Buckingham Palace has contested reports about the duke’s links to Epstein, including the private jet flights, over “a number of inconsistencies”.On Tuesday, 16 women who claim they were victims of Epstein spoke at a hearing in New York after a judge offered the accusers the opportunity to give statements about the impact of the alleged offending.“He knows exactly what he’s done and I hope he comes clean about it,” Mrs Giuffre said outside court in response to a request for comment about the duke.Andrew released a statement at the weekend expressing “tremendous sympathy” for Epstein’s alleged victims.He also reiterated that it was a “mistake” seeing Epstein (66) after the American’s release from an 18-month prison term in 2010 for prostituting minors.In the statement, the duke said: “It is apparent to me since the suicide of Mr Epstein that there has been an immense amount of media speculation about so much in his life.“This is particularly the case in relation to my former association or friendship with Mr Epstein.“Therefore I am eager to clarify the facts to avoid further speculation.“I met Mr Epstein in 1999. During the time I knew him, I saw him infrequently and probably no more than only once or twice a year. I have stayed in a number of his residences.“At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.”Epstein was found dead on August 10th in his prison cell in New York, where he was being held on sex trafficking charges.–PA "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Ruth Davidson to resign as Scottish Tory leader following Parliament suspensionSquirrels are destroying tributes at graveyard and eating mourners\u0026#39 flowersDrug dealers offered driving lessons instead of prison in new police scheme Judge criticises Instagram for failing to hand over paedophile\u0026#39s chat logs Swimmers told to avoid seals after man left with infected bite in Norfolk Pentonville Prison \u0026#39overrun\u0026#39 by \u0026#39insecticide resistant\u0026#39 cockroaches, watchdog findsComment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s unprecedented decision is indeed a threat to our democracyAlarmed tourists watch huge volcanic eruption on Italy\u0026#39s Stromboli island Babies born by Caesarean one third more likely to develop autism Average smoker now down to 10 a day, in wake of smoking ban What does it mean to prorogue Parliament, and what is the impact on Brexit?China calls on police to guard \u0026#39southern gate\u0026#39 as Hong Kong leader eyes emergency powersAssaults on French emergency services reach record highWarning over e-scooters after police figures reveal thousands of road incidents Comment: Brexiteers may not like the backstop, but it is a necessary compromiseIt\u0026#39s Boris v Bercow: why the Speaker will fight his corner on Brexit \u0026#39Constitutional outrage\u0026#39, \u0026#39utterly scandalous\u0026#39, \u0026#39threat to democracy\u0026#39 - how MPs reacted to PM\u0026#39s bid to suspend ParliamentTeenage climate activist Greta Thunberg completes transatlantic crossing on zero-emissions yachtMajor hoard of \u0026#39£5m\u0026#39 Norman coins are early example of tax avoidance, British Museum saysThe Great British Bake Off losers\u0026#39 club: how does it feel to leave in week one?Spanish babies develop \u0026#39werewolf syndrome\u0026#39 after alopecia drug sold as reflux syrup in lab mix-up We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/08/26/TELEMMGLPICT000207342971_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-rliM5zHz0XWvGpEs52xCXzYxy3cFh7YvYpmjsGRqOA.jpeg?imwidth=","title":"cricket bosses squandering golden chance entice next generation","story":"Where will the next Ben Stokes come from with grassroots cricket under threat?Nobody knows the first thing about prejudice, wrote Paul Johnson, unless they are a red-haired, left-handed Catholic.

It’s going to be fine.” He went on to slice his finger three times during filming, requiring large plasters.The weekly showstopper challenge saw contestants asked to create the cake of their childhood dreams, with fairy gardens, toadstool houses, pirate islands and purple carousels from the younger bakers and a “retro” rocket from veteran of the group Phil, 56. Despite their difficulties, the bakers appeared to have impressed the judges. Hollywood said: “Every year of Bake Off, the standard has got better and better and better, and I expect this year to be just the same.”Evicted from the tent was 33-year-old support worker Dan, who said his wife had helped him practice along with his “amazing” parents.  “I am not going to miss the baking under pressure,” he said. “I’m just going to miss everyone in that tent.”The Great British Bake Off will be on Channel 4 at 8pm on Tuesdays.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The Duke has always denied the allegations and any involvement. Lawyer David Boies, representing several of Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s alleged victims arrives with Annie Farmer, second right, and Virginia GiuffreMrs Roberts-Giuffre was one of several accusers on Tuesday to mention Miss Maxwell by name in an emotionally-charged hearing, held to close the case against Epstein, who died on August 10 from suspected suicide inside a Manhattan jail.Chauntae Davies gave a harrowing account of being recruited by Miss Maxwell, and raped on his US Virgin Island home.“I was searching for words but all I could say was ‘no’,” she said. “But that seemed to excite him more.“I ran off, my feet bloody from the rocks on the island. I cried myself to sleep that night.”Another Epstein accuser, South African-born Sarah Ransome, told the court that she too was “a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”She added: “We all know that he did not act alone. We are all survivors, and the pursuit of justice should not end.”Multiple women have filed civil lawsuits against Epstein\u0026#39s estate since his death, saying he abused them and seeking damagesMiss Maxwell, 56, has always denied accusations of any wrongdoing, and has accused Mrs Roberts-Giuffre of lying. Mrs Roberts-Giuffre then sued for slander in a case which was settled in 2017, but whose documents were unsealed last month.Since then the British heiress’s whereabouts have remained unknown, with her lawyers refusing to respond to The ’s requests for comment. On August 14 she was reported to have been lying low in a Massachusetts mansion a day later The New York Post published a photo of her – the first since 2016 - taken at a Los Angeles burger bar. The paper claimed the photo was taken earlier that week. She has not been seen since.In court on Tuesday, accuser after accuser stepped forwards to tell how Epstein and his associates inflicted immeasurable damage on their lives.Among them was the first British woman to publicly allege abuse by the late financier. Anouska de Georgiou, 42, an actress who was at school with the Duchess of Cambridge, gave a heartfelt speech about the impact of Epstein\u0027s actions.Anouska De Georgiou appeared in the 2004 film Alfie with Jude LawShe said: When I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein I was young and full of hope and the foolishness of a teenager. Jeffrey Epstein manipulated me, coerced me and abused me.He cannot begin to fathom what he did to us. Although I think it is tragic when anyone died before their time, I am extremely relieved he will not be able to hurt any more children.Epstein was known to have travelled to the UK several times, staying at Sandringham as a guest of the Duke of York, and attending, along with the Queen, the duke’s 40th birthday party in June 2000 at Windsor Castle. Jennifer Araoz, who came forward on July 10 to accuse Epstein of raping her when she was 14, fought back tears to detail the years of torture she has suffered since her attack.“The fact that I will never have the chance to face my predator in court eats away at my soul,” she said.“This weak, evil coward will never steal our inner strength. And he will never, ever, ever steal our voice.”Death of a financier | Jeffrey Epstein’s final daysMany of Epstein\u0027s accusers agreed with the financier\u0027s legal team that an investigation into his strange death must give answers. Reid Weingarten, Epstein\u0027s lawyer, said that Epstein\u0027s body had been moved before forensic analysis could be carried out, and demanded to know why the prison guards were reportedly refusing to testify about events on the night of his death, and why his team had not been able to view video camera footage from inside the jail.The footage, he said, was corrupted, and he wanted to know how long the system had been malfunctioning.What if the tapes only broke down when he died? Then we are in a whole different territory, he said, saying that the whole case was full of conspiracy theory galore.I think it is the understatement of the year to say the world looks and feels different to when I last stood here, he said. The elephant in the room is what happened to our client.Courtney Wild, whose July 15 testimony helped ensure Epstein was not granted bail, echoed their anger at his untimely death.“Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health,” she said. “Jeffrey Epstein robbed myself and the other victims of our chance to confront him, one by one. For that he is a coward.“I feel very angry and sad. Justice has never been served in this case.”Judge Richard Berman, presiding over the court, listened attentively as the women told their stories – many of them for the first time.In the front row sat Geoffrey Berman, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose decision to arrest Epstein on July 6 re-opened the case.He was surrounded by a roll call of America’s most high-powered and influential lawyers – among them Al Gore’s former lawyer David Boies, representing five of the victims Paul Cassell, a former federal prosecutor now working for four accusers and famed women\u0027s rights lawyer Gloria Allred, representing five women, and preparing to speak to several more.Time after time, Epstein was described as “sick” and “depraved”, a man who resorted to “insidious and pathological violence”.“In 2004, at the age of 14, I was flown to Jeffrey Epstein’s Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and molested for hours,” said one accuser, whose anonymous statement was read out by Ms Allred.“What I remember most vividly was him explaining how beneficial this was to me as he abused me. Especially as he positioned me on the floor, looking at the photos of him smiling with famous people.“After he finished with me, he wanted me to describe how good my first sexual experience was.”Parents banned from playground amid concerns children\u0026#39s independence is being stifledBrexit latest news: Ruth Davidson to resign as Scottish Tory leader following Parliament suspensionSquirrels are destroying tributes at graveyard and eating mourners\u0026#39 flowersDrug dealers offered driving lessons instead of prison in new police scheme Judge criticises Instagram for failing to hand over paedophile\u0026#39s chat logs Swimmers told to avoid seals after man left with infected bite in Norfolk Pentonville Prison \u0026#39overrun\u0026#39 by \u0026#39insecticide resistant\u0026#39 cockroaches, watchdog findsComment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s unprecedented decision is indeed a threat to our democracyAlarmed tourists watch huge volcanic eruption on Italy\u0026#39s Stromboli island Babies born by Caesarean one third more likely to develop autism Average smoker now down to 10 a day, in wake of smoking ban What does it mean to prorogue Parliament, and what is the impact on Brexit?China calls on police to guard \u0026#39southern gate\u0026#39 as Hong Kong leader eyes emergency powersAssaults on French emergency services reach record highWarning over e-scooters after police figures reveal thousands of road incidents Comment: Brexiteers may not like the backstop, but it is a necessary compromiseIt\u0026#39s Boris v Bercow: why the Speaker will fight his corner on Brexit \u0026#39Constitutional outrage\u0026#39, \u0026#39utterly scandalous\u0026#39, \u0026#39threat to democracy\u0026#39 -

Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.“Brexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,” said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp“The ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies.

They include media companies Bloomberg and Discovery, and financial firms MarketAxess and Norinchukin.\u0026nbspOther businesses attracted to the Netherlands because of Brexit are in the IT, advertising, life sciences and health sectors.\u0026nbspThe interest in the country is likely to grow further in coming months, according to the agency.“Our experience shows that when a Brexit deal gets further out of sight, and the chance of a no deal increases, more companies contact us,” said Mr Nijland.Other countries whose firms may be affected by a no-deal Brexit and who are considering relocating \u0026nbspinclude France, Ireland, Germany and Belgium, he added.\u0026nbspDespite the greater interest from foreign companies, overall Britain’s departure from the EU “is not good news” for the Netherlands, Mr Bakhuizen said.\u0026nbsp“The UK is our second-largest trading partner in Europe\u0026nbspand 200,000 jobs in the Netherlands are related to the economic relationship with the UK,” he noted.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rest wanted to move into the UK but changed their plans due to Brexit.\u0026nbspAnother 325 firms are thinking of setting up in the Netherlands for the same reason, the representative\u0026nbspsaid. Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.“Brexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,” said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp“The ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies. That is why more and more companies are orienting themselves in the Netherlands as a potential new base in the European market.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Iceland said it will review its promotional calendar, while Asda disagreed with the suggestion that its offers are misleading.“While most of the deals we monitored did represent good value, we spotted 65 instances across the year of supermarkets using misleading discounts that didn’t represent the bargains they claimed.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide1347 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugar1447 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active1647 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.1747 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.1847 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.1947 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.2047 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.2147 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 2247 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues2347 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2447 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2547 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.2647 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2747 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2847 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2947 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression3147 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3447 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3547 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3647 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3747 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3847 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3947 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.4047 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.4147 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.4247 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4347 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4447 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4547 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4647 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4747 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 147 Baldness cure looks to be a step closerResearchers in the US claim to have overcome one of the major hurdles to cultivating human follicles from stem cells. The new system allows cells to grow in a structured tuft and emerge from the skin247 Air pollution linked to fertility issues in womenExposure to air from traffic-clogged streets could leave women with fewer years to have children, a study has found. Italian researchers found women living in the most polluted areas were three times more likely to show signs they were running low on eggs than those who lived in cleaner surroundings, potentially triggering an earlier menopause347 Two hours a week spent in nature can improve healthA study in the journal Scientific Reports suggests that a dose of nature of just two hours a week is associated with better health and psychological wellbeing447 Junk food ads could be banned before watershedJunk food adverts on TV and online could be banned before 9pm as part of Government plans to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity.547 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. The scientists\u0026nbspfound the gut microbiome of red wine drinkers was more erse compared to those who had drunk other alcoholic drinks.The UK results matched up to three other groups tested in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.Researchers have speculated this is due to\u0026nbsphigher quantities of polyphenol - an organic chemical compound found in the tannins from grapes\u0027 skin which play an essential role making\u0026nbspred wine.They are believed to have\u0026nbspantioxidant properties\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspare also found in fruits, vegetables, chocolate, wine, coffee and tea,\u0026nbspand are thought to contribute to protecting the heart and reducing cancer risks“While we have long known of the unexplained benefits of\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine\u0026nbspon heart health, this study shows that moderate\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine\u0026nbspconsumption is associated with greater ersity and a healthier gut microbiota that partly explain its long-debated beneficial effects on health,” Caroline Le Roy, one of the study’s authors,\u0026nbspsaid.Medical professionals said the negative impact of drinking alcohol should not be ignored, despite the study.“No doctor would recommend drinking on medical grounds, as any potential benefits of red wine polyphenols should be considered\u0026nbspalongside alcohol’s links to over 200 health conditions, including heart disease and cancers as identified in the Chief Medical Officer’s guidelines review,”\u0026nbspSadie Boniface, research co-ordinator at the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said.“Polyphenols are also available from a range of other foods besides\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine.”The team behind the new study, published in the journal\u0026nbspGastroenterology,\u0026nbspsaid if people wanted to consume alcohol, red wine was the healthiest option.“Although we observed an association between\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine\u0026nbspconsumption and the gut microbiota ersity, drinking\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine\u0026nbsprarely, such as once every two weeks, seems to be enough to observe an effect,” Ms\u0026nbspLe Roy said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Usually, Apple works over the summer on the next big release, meaning that it is ready in time for the autumn release of the new handsets.But Apple pushed out iOS 13.1 to developers, offering them the option to get their apps ready for the new software. But there is something unprecedented about that decision:\u0026nbspiOS 13 has not even been finished let alone released to the public.The release was initially taken to be a mistake, and some suggested that Apple had simply wrongly numbered the latest versions of iOS 13. But it became clear that it was intentional, and that Apple was planning to allow developers to work on iOS 13.1 even before iOS 13 had arrived.Created with Sketch.

And many experts are suggesting that iOS 13 may simply not be fully ready for the public, forcing Apple to change its release schedule.That could mean that Apple will strip some features out of iOS 13, when it arrives in September and on the new phones. Those features could then be added in again at a later stage, when they are finished and iOS 13.1 is made available to users.Apple would presumably have to admit that those iOS 13 features were not finished and that users will have to wait for later software updates for them to be enabled.Some beta testers of early versions of iOS 13 had already noted that there appeared to be problems with the software. It has been widely reported to include more bugs and problems than previous releases, and early users have expressed concern that it would not be ready in time.That would explain why Apple could be forced to simply admit defeat on attempting to get those updates ready in time, and push them back into a later update.Apple revealed iOS 13 during its Worldwide Developers Conference, its biggest release of the year, in June. It brings a whole new design in the form of a dark mode, as well as a variety of other tweaks and new features that will be added to the software.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as stopping people from being able to login through the website, it means that all information stored on those pages is unavailable.“We are aware that customers are currently experiencing issues accessing our websites and online banking login pages, an RBS spokesperson said.\u0026nbspWe apologise for the inconvenience caused.We are aware of the problem and are working hard to fix it.

On Monday, Wells Fargo published a research note that said a deal could make sense now, in part because Altria has a stake in the vaping company Juul.Philip Morris had a market value of nearly $121 billion at the close of trading in New York on Monday, while Altria was worth about $88 billion.Tobacco giant launches life insurance firm with discount to ex-smokersTobacco giant accused of \u0027staggering hypocrisy\u0027 over stop smoking adsPhilip Morris boss Peter Nixon on taking the smoke out of smokingPhilip Morris wants to stop selling cigarettes, says ad campaignA reunification would combine two of the most popular smoking alternative products: IQOS and Juul. Philip Morris has been ploughing billions of dollars in promoting IQOS, a heat-not-burn product used by millions consumers outside the US. Altria meanwhile has invested $12.8 billion in e-cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc., which has catapulted itself to the US industry leader in smoking alternatives in just a few years.Altria also has been planning to start selling IQOS in the U.S. this year, testing out demand in the Atlanta area with a store opening next month.Philip Morris said in a statement that no agreement has been formally reached and any deal would be subject to board, shareholder and regulatory approval.

Polanski\u0026nbsppleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977 before fleeing the United States for Europe. He has lived in France since.“I don’t separate the man from the art,” Martel said of Polanski, according to\u0026nbspDeadline. “I think that important aspect of the work emerges in the man.”Created with Sketch.Best films of 2019 (so far) Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab435 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1735 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3335 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3535 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab435 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1735 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3335 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3535 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.She said she wouldn’t attend a dinner planned for Polanski’s film, adding:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I will not congratulate him, but I think it is correct that his movie is here at this festival, we have to do develop our dialogue with him and this is the best possible place to go on with this type of discussion.”Only two films made by women are on the Venice Film Festival line-upMartel called the situation regarding Polanski’s conviction “difficult” to judge.\u0026nbsp“A man who commits a crime of this size who is then condemned, and the victim considers herself satisfied with the compensation is difficult for me judge… It is difficult to define what is the right approach we have to take with people who have committed certain acts and were judged for them. I think these questions are part of the debate in our times,” she said.Her position contrasts with that of festival director Alberto Barbera, who said he’s “convinced that we have to distinguish necessarily between the artist and the man” – an opinion he also expressed in July when the festival line-up was unveiled.The jury president whose film\u0026nbspThe Headless Woman\u0026nbspcompeted for the Palme\u0026nbspd’Or in Cannes in 2008, also spoke in favour of quotas to ensure gender equality among festival line-ups.Venice was criticised in July for only including two films by female directors in its official selection for 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Once it arrives to Mars it will use its own onboard engines to navigate its way safely to the Martian surface. One of the biggest breakthroughs of the Starhopper and Starship is that they run on liquid methane and liquid oxygen, which can both be found and manufactured on Mars.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red. These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star\u0027s mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star\u0027s core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another.

It found multiple “suspicious offers” in all of them apart from Sainsbury’s.Among the “misleading” discounts it discovered was an offer at Iceland to buy two packs of Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut for £4, which works out as £2 each. However, the pack price was just £1.49 a week earlier.Morrisons promoted Cathedral City Mature Cheddar Cheese as “was £3.50 now £2” for a week in September, even though the product was available for £2 the month before.Meanwhile, Asda labelled Wall’s Carte D’Or Strawberry Ice Cream “was £3.50 now £2”. But the 1l tub was sold at £2 for longer, with the so-called special offer running only for 12 weeks.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesFollowing a Which? complaint in 2015, the government published new guidance to make sure retailers’ pricing practices comply with consumer law. The rules state that information presented to consumers must be fair, must not waste time or cause disappointment, and should not lead buyers to overspend.“Four years on from our super-complaint on misleading pricing practices, many of the big supermarkets are clearly still in the wrong, with numerous examples of dodgy discounts and never-ending offers,” said Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?.“These retailers must stop tricking shoppers with deceptive deals and spurious special offers.”Which? will report its findings to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and Ms Hitchins urged the CMA to intervene if necessary.Only two of the supermarkets responded to Which? when presented with the findings. Iceland said it will review its promotional calendar, while Asda disagreed with the suggestion that its offers are misleading.“While most of the deals we monitored did represent good value, we spotted 65 instances across the year of supermarkets using misleading discounts that didn’t represent the bargains they claimed.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences — just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find £. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on £,,, Graham Norton is on £, and Claudia Winkleman is on £,.Lineker’s salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn’t bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend £million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That’s more than the annual budget of Radio .It’s particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners’ TV licences, but can fritter away £million on Facebook adverts There’s almost nothing Auntie won’t stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the “yoof” audience.It has earmarked £million to promote its new Sounds app — including spending £, to transform the London Eye into the “London Ear” — and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ­stories about when sex goes wrong.It’s all a far cry from Lord Reith’s mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract — and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV’s Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out £. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay £. for an “internet licence” to fund Apple’s iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It’s time to do away with the licence fee — for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions — such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than £billion — and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.No s, no buts. When it comes to renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, it’s time to say: “No deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If we do have to take that route it will surely not be long before discussions on a free trade deal recommence.Yet those same Remainers bizarrely retreat in horror when anyone suggests we do a free trade deal with the US. “But we’ll have to eat chlorinated chicken,” they complain, as well as GM “Frankenstein” food.As shown by their failure yesterday to agree on a common course of action to thwart Brexit, Remainers are bumbling along in a state of confusion.But nothing demonstrates this better than their contradictory approach to free trade. They seem to think it a great benefit to the country when conducted with the EU, but a route to national disastercarried out with any other country.The charge that anyone will be forced to eat chlorinated chicken or GM foods is, needless to say, a far bigger porky pie than anything Boris has said on the subject.It is far from certain that a Johnson Government, when engaged in trade talks with the US, will make the concessions allowing these products into UK markets, butit does, then UK shoppers will continue to have a choice.They will still be able to buy chicken produced in Britain or the EU, or they will be able to choose to eat American chicken.I certainly have no fear of eating chicken which has been washed in chlorine. The idea that it is “dangerous” has been thoroughly debunked. Each of us ingests far more chlorine through drinking water than we ever would do through eating US-produced chicken.As for GM foods, we already eat them, vegans especially. The EU allows imports of GM soyafor simple practical reasons. Most of it is grown in the Americas and too many growers there use GM seed for non-GM soya to be sold as a separate product.If we want free trade we are not going to achieve it just by persuading other countries to open their markets to us. No, we will have to make the concession of opening our markets to them too. But there is no reason to be frightened.True, there are some products which need to be banned from sale for genuine health and safety reasons. But most of the EU’s food product standards are really just a form of protectionism in disguise, dreamed up to block competition for European farmers.If we do post-Brexit trade deals with the US and other countries — and in the process do away with the EU’s protectionist tarfs and product standards — some UK producers would suffer.But others would prosper as they enjoyed access to new export markets. Overall, as is almost always the case when trade barriers are taken down, we would benefit. Strong industries would grow and consumers would enjoy greater choice and lower prices.Boris’s vision of a global British pork pie industry shows the dference between him and the political opponents who spent much of yesterday scheming over how to stop him taking Britain out of the EU.While his glass is half full, theirs is half empty.They are driven by a pathological fear of le outside the EU.It is not that they have any great enthusiasm for the EU. After all, I haven’t heard one of them make a convincing case why the EU is an institution to be admired. It is just that they have a lack of ambition for Britain and so cling to EU membership.After meeting for several hours yesterday, what did the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jo Swinson come up with That they want to extend Article  yet further, to prolong yet again the endless drt which unsettled markets and put off investment.Thanks to the Remain lobby’s endless infighting and self-indulgent argument over who it would like as a caretaker Prime Minister, that is exactly what is overwhelmingly likely to happen on October . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not all families can afford to spend money on food inside the park - wed already paid over £ to get in.We were so angry but we did it, the kids were looking forward to the day out but it was money down the drain.We are on a budget and cant afford to spend loads. We also werent aware of these rules before we went as everywhere  seems to allow picnics.Zahira said the family ended up spending an additional £ on food outside the park.She said: Being Muslims we have specic dietary needs, so we found it easier and cheaper to go to a halal takeaway nearby for lunch.We tried to explain why we had brought our own lunch, but the woman at the entrance to the park saidwe didnt dispose of them we werent allowed into the park.We had saved so hard for this day trip. We spent over £ on tickets, £ on fuel, £ on food and drinks in advance to take with us, then another £ inside the park on drinks and merchandise, as well as £ for food at the takeaway.We didnt want to keep our food in the lockers - it was a hot day. It was diabolical and unacceptable.I found it disgusting that they wouldnt allow us to take our food in.

I thought the police would know that [theyd broken into my car] and we’d be on way home.But instead, she was locked up in a rat-infested prison and forced to live next to a cruel mother who had doused her baby in bleach.Every year  Brits are arrested abroad and find themselves in terrying situations, holed up in cells, without lawyers, at the whim of a foreign police force and scared for their lives.In tonights episode of Channel  series Young, Dumb and Locked up in the Sun, Kaylee and two other young Brits tell their stories. Kaylee Carson’s decision to go on a short break to France was completely spontaneous and great fun – at the start. “My cousin said she needed tobacco and I said, ‘Let’s go to France and get you some – it’s cheaper,’” recalls Kaylee, who lives in Peterborough. “It was a four-hour drive to Dover. We got on the ferry straight away.It was boiling hot weather and we were standing at the front, breeze blowing in our hair, re-enacting Titanic! It was really nice.”After a lovely day spent sightseeing in Calais and buying cigarettes, they missed their ferry back but bought aticket from Dunkirk for am the following morning, booking a night in a hotel.When they went through security at the docks the next morning, a guard asked Kaylee to open her boot. She thought nothing of it - but under when she lted the lid she was horried.“My face dropped,” says Kaylee. “There was a family of three in there with a blanket wrapped around them and bags and bags of clothes. I guess they were trying to escape. I said, Get them out of my car, why are you in my car ”Kaylee was in shock and presumed they’d jumped into the boot when they were sleeping at the hotel.“I tried not to panic. I thought the police would know that and that soon we’d be on our way home,” says Kaylee.But it wasnt that easy.The pair were handcuffed and taken to a cell at the ferry port for questioning. “They said you’re lying to us,” says Kaylee. “They thought we’d set it up or real smugglers had asked us to do this. They were telling us we’re going to jail.”The penalty for human trafficking in France is up to  years in prison and a fine of up to £.million.“We begged them and pleaded and cried,” says Kaylee. “We told them we’ve got babies at home and jobs to go to.”But it made no dference. After a week spent in custody, Kaylee and her cousin were summonsed to court. They were told they were going to be kept on remand in prison while the investigation continued and the pair were transferred to a French jail in Lille. “It was quite scary, there was a lot of shouting,” says Kaylee. “The screw wasn’t soft, she was quite pushy and pushed you here, pushed you there. I wanted to turn around and smack her - it was surreal. They told us we were the only English girls in jail and we could stay together. It was really dirty. There were rats running around everywhere.”For  hours a day the pair were kept locked up in the cell, only allowed a half an hour break in the exercise yard in the morning and afternoon.Their fellow inmates were a nightmare. “We didn’t feel safe at all,” says Kaylee. “One of our glasses smashed and we kept a bit in our bra as it felt a bit safer.In one room one woman was screaming and shouting because she was in a bad mood and it went on all day, all night - it was awful.Then they put a girl next to us who had a baby with a black guy and she’d thrown bleach on the baby to try and turn the baby white. I was just disgusted that they put her near us and we banged on her wall all night and they moved her away.“I lost three stone, most of my baby weight,” says Kaylee. “But my cousin drove me crazy – anyone wouldyou were with them  hours a day.”Kaylee and her cousin were were convinced the “screws” were anti-British and messed with their heads, often banging on their doors in the middle of the night just to wake them up and once even turning off the water for  hours in their cell.Every day they woke up in hope and finally, after three months, they were asked to sign some paperwork and told to pack their stuff. They were released without charge and deported from France. “There was such excitement to see my daughter and to see my family and friends,” says Kaylee. “It was surreal, going onto the plane. I said, “give me a beer!” It felt like forever but it could have been so much worse. No more tobacco runs.”Huddersfield painter and decorator Robert Kaskovich had been on holiday to Thailand over a dozen times and loved it.“Going so many times over the years, I’d heard the stories of people being locked up but I’d never had one bit of trouble before this trip,” says Robert.Robert met James, his old mate from home, and the pair went south to the idyllic holiday island of Phuket with one plan: to drink and meet girls.“I’d come out of a relationship, he was single. It was just two lads going out, trying to pull women, having a laugh with them and meeting lots of people,” says Robert.They went to the infamous Bangla Road area of Phuket where the roads were lined with strip clubs, go go bars and nightclubs. Robert met an English girl who was living out there and he took her to get some food. When he saw someone’s scooter blocking in another scooter he made the fateful decision of going over to move it.“The next thing I know police are tapping me on the shoulder asking me what I was doing,” says Robert, describing the moment his evening – and his holiday – went pear-shaped.The Thai police asked him to breathe into a breathalyser and being way over the limit they put him in the back of their car. Thailand has a zero tolerance policy on drink driving andconvicted the penalty is up to  years in jail and a £, fine.Robert was driven back to the station, where the police told him he’d spend a night in the cell then go to court the following morning. “They took my belt and phone off me and nothing was said whatsoever,” says Robert. “One minute I’m partying and the next I’m in a police cell with  other Thai people. I’d done nothing wrong. I was terried.  The cell was three by four metres long, there was one toilet in it, ants were running across the floor, stinking of s*** and p***, with no pillows.”A fellow Dutch inmate told him he’d either be moved to another prison or would have to pay to get out.Three days later, an officer starting talking to him about money, saying it would cost Robert , Baht - about £ - to get an early release.But Robert said no and he was transferred to another prison, this time caged with hard-nosed criminals.“One had a ball and chain on his ankles which told me he was a killer or a big drug dealer,” says Robert. “He was very intimidating to look at and I stayed in the opposite corner to him. No one offered you water. There was two meals a day, rice with the driest egg ever and I couldn’t eat it. I was starving in a cell, everyone’s p***ing and s****ing in front of each other and I didn’t know how I was going to get out.”After seven days banged up, Robert received a visit from the tourist police who negotiated his release for , Baht  - £ - with the commissioner. After signing  Thai documents, Robert was released on condition he ed to court the next day.“I drank, and drank and had the best night. It was the most drunk I’ve ever been in Thailand and I didn’t get in till am,” says Robert.Welsh builder Aaron Hughes was an adrenaline junkie who was banged up in Las Vegas after swimming across a dangerous dam.Away on a stag do, Aaron and his mates  started drinking on the plane over there and had been drinking  for  hours straight by the time they went to visit the Grand Canyon and the Hoover Dam – a concrete  metre tall dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River.“I’d never heard it before,’ says Arron. “ We had a case of beer in the back of the car and it was roasting -  degrees. We were waving at everyone on the highway. We were buzzing.”When they got to the Dam, Arron made a decision which he didn’t realise was both illegal and le-threatening.“I looked at the sheer size of the wall and I made a split second decision I was going to swim the dam,” he recalls. “I was looking up at the wall - it was crazy. I hadn’t a care in the world and was wonderingI could get to the other side. I was doing a bit of backstroke, everything, trying to get across. My friends were looking down, taking pictures.” Arron was in the water for over half an hour and was exhausted when he came out.“I didn’t think anything of the legality of it,” he says. “It was only when I saw the police. I thought it wasn’t that bad – all I did was have a little swim.”But it’s against the law to swim within  yards of dams in the USA - and doing so carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison.When he climbed out – still in his shoes and shorts – Arron was arrested. “I thought, “S*** here we go, we’re getting arrested in Vegas  - not a good start to the holiday.”They took him to a holding cell there where he started to panic about what was going to happen. Then eventually, two officers walked in and said to Arron, “That was f***ing awesome” and shook his hand.  “I couldn’t get my head around it,” says Arron. “ people had died doing what I’d done and they’d never seen anyone survive doing that.”Incredibly for Arron, it was a beautul, cloudless day and only one turbine in the dam was on out of . Any cloud cover over the solar dishes and up to  turbines would have been on and the swirl of the water would have swallowed him whole. “Someone was looking after me that day,” says Arron.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior military spokesman said: A large quantity of components presumably needed to build a ,-tonne sub, which the North has been developing, have turned up recently at a shipyard in Sinpo, South Hamgyong Province.Weve also spotted a floating dock deployed off Sinpo, apparently for a missile test.Satellite imagery taken in March showed cylindrical components. It is speculated they are bulkheads which will be welded together to form the submarines hull. None of the components could be seen from space last year.A South Korean military spokesman said: This suggests that the North has kept building a new sub and testing a submarine-launched ballistic missile.”This means construction has been underway just weeks after the June Singapore summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump and the one in Vietnam last February.The North already has a ,-ton submarine. This is said to be capable of carrying only one ballistic missile.Yet the new sub could deploy three or four.   This is still far behind the capability of other nuclear powers.The Royal Navy for example has four ,-ton subs that each can launch  Trident nuke missiles. The United States Navy, meanwhile, has  Ohio class boats, which are about similar size and firepower as the British ones.  But while the new sub would not match those possessed by existing nuclear powers, the building of the North Korean vessel would drastically increase its strategic strike capability.Any launch would be hard to detect and it might be unclear which nation fired the missile.Gen Terrence OShaughnessy, the commander of the US Northern Command, said in a hearing at a US Senate Armed Services Subcommittee the Norths deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles is imminent.Gen OShaughnessy said it is almost certain they are designed for an attack on the US mainland."},{"url":null,"title":"mum abandon kids work","story":"When her two sons were found, the older boy said they were left without breakfast and the toddler had soiled himself.The woman, in her s, pleaded guilty to two counts of doing an act of cruelty to a child at Cambridge Crown Court last week.The alarm was raised when representatives for the older boys school grew concerned about his attendance and visited the family home in Cambs.They found the boys were regularly left alone without supervision for hours at a time, sometimes in the evening.The seven-year-old also said he was regularly left without breakfast and on the day of the visit he had gone to a local shop, bought a burger and then cooked it unsupervised.The mum, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was handed a six-month prison term, which was suspended for a year.DC Diane Booth of Cambridgeshire Police, said: Due to the actions of the teachers in this case we were able to safeguard these children and ensure they did not come to further harm.We all have a responsibility to protect children in our communities.

Make no mistake about it: what we’ve witnessed today is nothing short of the start of an anti-democratic coup worthy of a tin-pot dictator.The Government, spurred on by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party snapping at its heels, have called on the Queen to help them force through a damaging No Deal Brexit.This is dangerous move which could kill the existing relationship between the monarchy and Parliament, requiring the Queen to stay away from political decision-making. That tradition has been upheld for hundreds of years – and Boris Johnson has torn it up in the space of a month in pursuit of his political ambitions. But this coup will have other long-term consequences for Brits up and down the country.    At the last election the majority of parties pledged they would not allow No Deal and in the referendum even the leavers said that No deal was a bad idea. By forcing through a No Deal Brexit, the government will have ignored widespread warnings about food and medicine shortages, NHS ward closures and security risks. It will cost the public billions and usher in a new era of austerity. Because of these dangers and strong evidence that the public does not want a No Deal Brexit, MPs have explicitly voted against a No Deal Brexit on no fewer than three occasions. The Government’s move to try to suspend Parliament is an attempt to force through No Deal anyway – against Parliament and the people’s will. I therefore call on Parliament and the people to resist this deeply anti-democratic move, using any peaceful means available to them.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBoris Johnson has declared war on Parliament by confirming he plans to suspend Parliament for a month - and hold a Queen’s Speech on October . That means MPs face a race against time to thwart the Prime Minister taking the UK out of the EU without a Brexit deal on October . Johnson says he wants an opportunity to set up new bills to ‘level up’ spending on his priorities, including the NHS, education and policing. But his plan will also dramatically cut down the amount of time MPs have to block Johnson pressing forward with a chaotic no-deal Brexit . Commons Speaker John Bercow has branded it a constitutional outrage. Activists have begun the process of legal action. And Jeremy Corbyn has written to the Queen asking for an urgent meeting, accusing the PM of a smash-and-grab on our democracy. Here’s everything you need to know about Boris Johnson ’s new plan - and what it means for Brexit.  He’s setting the date for a Queen’s Speech and State Opening of Parliament . This effectively reboots Parliament, setting off a new ‘session’ and shutting down the old one. This process called proroguing usually happens every year - but it doesn’t have to, and Theresa May chose not to have a Queen’s Speech in -, so she’d have more time to push Brexit plans through. That means weaposve now had the longest gap between Queenaposs Speeches for more than  years. To trigger a Queenaposs Speech Parliament has to have a short break, which usually lasts a few days. And when MPs , the slate is clear. Any legislation that was in the process of passing through Parliament is cancelled and MPs start the new session effectively from scratch.  aposProrouguingapos means to suspend a session of Parliament without dissolving it . So ending one session and kicking off a new one with a Queenaposs Speech. Rebooting Parliament. Charles I famously prorogued Parliament and kept it from sitting for  years between  and . That’s why you may be seeing comparisons to a power-mad king. Thataposs because Parliament is expected to be prorogued on around September - - meaning it will be off for a full month. What is the Queen’s Speech   It’s theannual address given by the Monarch to MPs and peers, opening the new session of Parliament. It’s used by the Prime Minister to outline the Government’s legislative programme for the upcoming session.  That hasn’t been fully confirmed, but here’s the most likely scenario. Parliament is expected tofrom recess on Tuesday September . It’s then expected to sit until September  or , when it would break up for party conference season. Usually, Parliament wouldstraight away after the end of Conservative Party Conference, which finishes on October . What’s being suggested is that instead the Queen will end the current session of Parliament on September  or , leaving a longer gap all the way to October .  It massively slashes the amount of time MPs have to pass any kind of blocking measures through Parliament. Let’s assume the Commons sits Monday to Friday - which it doesn’t always, but let’s assume it would in a crunch. If the original timeline were to take place, there would be a maximum of eight sitting days before the conference recess. And assuming they ed the Monday after Tory conference, there would be scope for  sitting days between then and the October  deadline. That’s  days in which an anti-no-deal coalition could work on ways to block it.    Now,there’s a Queen’s Speech on October , in all likelihood Parliament would stay in recess for the week before. There are usually five full days of debate following a Queen’s Speech - and another two days of votes on the speech on October -. This would make it exceptionally dficult to schedule any further business in the Commons during that time. So that would leave just seven potential sitting days between conferences and the Brexit deadline - and just  in total. There’s also the small matter of the European Council meeting on October , which will be the PM’s last opportunity to seal a new deal with the EU. Boris Johnson this morning said there will be “ample time” to debate Brexit before and after the October  meeting.    Can it be challenged in the courts  Former Prime Minister John Major had already warned he would take High Court action to stop Boris Johnson suspending Parliament to ram through no-deal. Gina Miller, the anti-Brexit campaigner, made similar noises. Within hours of the announcement, Remainer QC Jo Maugham said he was initiating legal action to try to stop Boris Johnson.    Can MPs hold a Parliament anyway  Technically yes, but it wonapost have legal effect. It comes just a day after Jeremy Corbyn and opposition leaders agreed to table a law next week aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit on October . More than  MPs also signed a declaration in Westminsteraposs Church House, vowing to carry on sitting in an alternative venueParliament is suspended. Moments before the Queenaposs Speech emerged, Tory Rory Stewart warned MPs would continue to run Parliament somewhere it was suspended. Labour MP Clive Lewis added: The police will have to remove us from the chamber. We will call on people to take to the streets. We will call an extraordinary session of Parliament. Can the Queen say no   She can, but she won’t. And she hasnapost. The Queen’s role in this is almost entirely ceremonial. Even her speech to Parliament is written by the Government. Constitutional experts have said The Queen would do everything possible to avoid becoming involved in any political battle the country finds itself in.

The Queen and the rest of the Royal Family looked in their element as they celebrated with the happy couple at Windsor Castle. But according to a report it was a very dferent story shortly afterwards, and the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex faced disappointment when the Monarch rejected a request they made about their home. According to the Sunday Times , the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle. The report, written by Rosa Nikkah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.    But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead, which they have since spent an astounding £.million of taxpayersapos money refurbishing. Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate. He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there.    When they were dating Meghan moved into Prince Harryaposs small two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace, which is just a few doors up from the Cambridge family. However shortly before the birth of Archie Harrison the couple moved into their new home, later than expected due to delays with the renovation work. List most things royal, most of the details about their new home have been kept secret - but there are a few things we do know. The couple enlisted the help of designer Vicky Charles, who is behind the decor at their favourite hangouts Soho House, to turn the building into their dream home.    Itaposs understood to be filled with all the latest tech and itaposs likely that they are able to control many dferent things from their phones. A source  told royal expert Katie Nicholl  : They are going all out with the refurbishment of the house, and as Harry loves his gadgets, it’s going to be very cool. They’ll be able to control everything from their smart phones. Itaposs understood that one the couple are also had a £, eco boiler installed, which means they will have access to hot water at all times. Frogmore Cottage is just  metres from the Long Walk - which is open to the public - so there is obviously a lot of security, which is also funded by the taxpayer.    Other entrances to the grounds are further from their new home - some just  metres away - but are further from open scrutiny, leading to fears they could be easily accessed.  Itaposs likely that they will have built a separate annex for their Private Protection Officers who will guard them  hours a day. A source close to the operation say planners have also discussed including as state of the art panic room.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back. So look out for many more tours to come from the man who wants to be yours."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44884850-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44884850-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44884850-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44884850-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"blether england goalie swift had hands the size o luggies said hector","story":"A BwB article in April triggered memories for Rob Boag.For his latest offering, he said: “His name lay dormant, cramped into a crevice of memory for more than half-a-century.“And there he was in an April BwB article – Billy Houliston – and my mind began to release Billy like a genie from a bottle.“Along with Billy, other names surfaced such as Billy Steel, Lawrie Reilly, Jimmy Mason, Willie Waddell and the brilliant Jimmy Cowan.“These are names of legends and ghosts from the past.“I was  years of age in April  when my family were huddled around the wireless listening to England v Scotland at Wembley.BLETHER: #Basher# Billy Houliston lived up to nickname and gave England #discomfort#\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp basher-lived-up-to-nickname-and-gave-england-discomfort embed # secretsCJnnwsFTq\" data-secret\"sCJnnwsFTq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“After the kick-off, England’s attack on Scotland’s goal was relentless and, for the first  minutes, it was Scotland’s goalkeeper Jimmy Cowan v England.“Time after time, just when the commentator was about to call a goal for England, Cowan’s fingertips deflected the ball over the bar or past the post.“Cowan played a blinder.“Then, slowly and surely, Scotland broke free from the English siege and, with the talents and brilliance of Steel, Mason and Waddell and the hustle of Houliston, the Scots began to control the game and dominate England.“It finished a - victory for the Scots.

The highlight is over the period, meeting and playing with some fantastic players.”And as he prepares to take them to Tannadice on Friday, that’s a message he’ll be passing on to the squad he’s in charge of now.“I think we’ve said from the start nothing will be won or lost just now, regardless of what happens in the match for either team.“Throw in Ayr United, Inverness and forgive meI’m missing others out but there will be a lot of teams challenging come March, April and into May. We want to be one of them.”That said, he does not hide how much he is looking forward to the biggest game of the season, so far, and, despite those mixed memories, it’s a fixture he relishes.“I’d say the highlight in a derby was here when we beat them -, I think for the first time in  years.“It was a big night for our fans because we were - up, they got back into the game but we got back in front.“It’s the goal that never gets spoken about, but it’s my favourite goal for Dundee, the header.“I know why everyone loved the one down therebecause we were - down with  minutes to go. It’s the nature of football.“Down there it was great because we were out the game so it felt like a win because we were - down with  minutes to go away from home.“But,it’s for a goal,I had to pick one of the two it was the one here.”Obviously, the injury three-and-half years ago was the low point, though, he is still able to look to the positive long-term outcome.“I look on the positive side. If that injury hadn’t happened I wouldn’t be leading a team down there this week.“I would have continued playing and I would have had some good times and some not so good times going through the later stages of my career.“Was it a blessing in disguise  Well I wouldn’t like to go through that again because it was a horric time for myself and my family but it helped me get a head start in coaching.”As for the injury itself, he admits he knew almost immediately how severe it was.“I’d had bad injuries before but nothing as shocking and as severe as that in terms of the reaction of people around it at the time.“I have to say, United were fantastic.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"heres to ewe gordon","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA -year-old  shepherd left the recent Mid Argyll Show with a clutch of prizes for his Texel sheep.Gordon MacLean, from Tarbert, saw off fine specimens of the Texel breed from more experienced sheep men and women to win the ewe lamb class.

The means for  protection is the European Union PGIdesignation, to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.Ruth, an experienced journalist, explained: #I became concerned about two years ago when, during Japan EU Canadatrade talks, the UK government did not submit one PGI for protection.#Across Europe, , food names were protected. It worries me greatly.#She continued: #I am also concerned about how hard it is becoming to source local food and drink. I live in rural Angus, and the carrots grown down the road from me started le just as Angus carrots, but they went away for packaging and came back as Great British carrots. Technically that is correct, butwe believe in supporting local farmers and making clear choices about food miles and quality, this is ridiculous.#She stressed: #This is not a protectionist campaign. I welcome trade with any part of the world as long as the farm assured quality is there.##Keep Scotland the Brand is about valuing the integrity of our food and drink and recognising that Scotland is the brand. Across the world, people recognise Scotland as a quality brand.#One in five Scots is employed in the food and drink sector, so it is vitally important to keep our brand quality.#We trust the food on our shelves at the moment. Butthe trade deals being proposed go through we#ll end up with a multi-tiered system of quality. If the Americans get the trade deal they want, the high food standards we have are really only going to be accessible to those who can afford to pay.#It#s bad enough people having to go to food banks to survive, without people not knowing why their kids are getting ill.Ruth Watson is keen to emphasise that Keep Scotland the Brand is not a political campaign and it#s not about Brexit.#It is a campaign looking at the realities of what is before us,# she says. #I think that we have to look with some alarm at the trade deals that have been done. The UK government just has not protected our food brands.##I do this campaign on a voluntary basis from my kitchen table,# she went on. #Many people do not know what is coming. Food is treated as a commodity rather than something we should be grateful for every day, that is how successful our farmers have been.#I just believe thatfarming fails, my community is going under.##I#ve been talking to elected representatives, I go round shows.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

Whatrsquos more, this system is central to the country reducing its CO emissions, whilst being more reliable, sustainable and cost-effective.The increased complexity of the system and the need to be able to flexibly match supply and demand means that digitalisation is an important part of the transition. Central to digitalisation is the accurate measurement of customer energy demands so the system can provide energy in the most efficient and costeffective way, and customers can accurately understand how they use energy. And that is where smart meters ndash available from your energy supplier at no extra cost - come in.Simply put, smart meters will make Britainrsquos energy grid, and energy system, smarter. This is because the data that they are able to generate allows our energy network to understand how much energy is being used, when and where across Great Britain.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched.

She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a hello."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-grammar-school-head-boy-follows-mum-39-s-example","story":"Thomas Leitch has been named head boy at Dunbar Grammar School, nearly  years after his mum, Karen

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence.

This poses a problem for many on the left who think politics isnt about achieving national sovereignty, but promoting social justice. They struggle to deal with it, and find a coherent vision of how to reconcile peoples need for identity and the demands of economic opportunity and social justice.Brexit has upset the UKrsquos constitutional applecart, and this English nationalist project has encouraged Scottish nationalism. Both projects seek to break up multinational unions in the name of sovereignty. Brexit has already split the UK down the middle, and similar vote in some future Scottish referendum would create a fissure in Scottish society that would last generations. We need something better.Whatever happens with Brexit, there is an alternative for the UK. The risks to economic opportunity and social justice presented by independence stem not from acknowledging Scottish identity, nor from increasing Scottish autonomy, but from breaking the economic and social bonds of the United Kingdom. Its domestic market is vital for Scotlands economy, and sharing resources across the UK supports social justice in Scotland through welfare and public spending programmes, as we saw again last week the latest GERS figures.We do not have to lose these benefits in order to gain more autonomy. Instead, Scotland, and the rest of the UK, should move to a more federal system. The structures of federalism, which means dferent levels of government each with their own responsibilities, can support dferent social models, but I argue for a progressive form of federalism, one designed to create the maximum scope for social justice in each part of the country. Here is what it would mean for Scotland.First of all, it implies a change of mindset in the whole UK, from the worn-out notions of parliamentary sovereignty which drive so much of our overcentralised government, especially in England, to an understanding that the UK really is a multinational state, a voluntary association of nations which come together to preserve their identities and promote their shared interests. That implies a better form of entrenchment for devolution in the UK constitution. Given the circumstances of Brexit, it means entrenching wider powers too.More important, perhaps, it implies a design which embeds the purpose of social justice in the territorial constitution. The federal UK parliament and government should be responsible for providing a guaranteed level of welfare and public service provision across the whole territory, irrespective of whether local taxable resources are big enough to support it, much as today.But government in the devolved nations should have the capacity to increase this from their own resourcesthey think it necessary. Thatrsquos an each-way bet for social justice.Wersquore already close to that for Scotland today. Not only is the Scottish Parliament responsible for most major public services, but it can supplement any welfare benefit it thinks unjustly small. It has the money too: not only is the devolved budget about  per cent per head higher than English levels, Holyrood has wide tax powers too.A UK which followed these principles would make a similar offer to the dferent regions of England. Many of those who voted Leave in the European referendum were expressing a beef with London, not Brussels: thats where they need to take back control from.Those obsessed with sovereignty and identity see nationalism as an end in itself. History tells us this is a dangerous road. But those who want to promote social justice and co-operation between dferent peoples cannot ignore the human need for acknowledgement of their identity. For them the right approach is a model of progressive federalism, empowering the UKrsquos nations and regions in a way which gives each level of government the power to promote a just society.This will be one of the themes explored by the new Think Tank Our Scottish Future being launched with an address by former PM Gordon Brown in Edinburgh this week."},{"url":null,"title":"four-go-trial-accused-trafficking-women-glasgow","story":"Three men and a woman are alleged to have brought more than a dozen women from Slovakia and held them in ldquoslavery or servitude.

Itrsquos an illogical position, when no deal is the default, and when any restrictions wouldnrsquot be binding on the PM, nor even necessarily within his gt .It is, however, no more bonkers than the Brexit Partyrsquos insistence that only a no deal Brexit is real Brexit ndash a stance no doubt inspired by government failure to deliver, but one that no one was advocating three years ago.Mr Corbyn, unlike the other party leaders, mentioned the continued possibility of a vote of no confidence. As Leader of the Opposition, hersquos best-placed to table one, but that is the extent of his advantage. Assumingit were won, the Labour leader would then have to demonstrate he had the necessary support to form a government, which means about  votes: ie, persuading some  non-Labour MPs to vote for him.The prospect of Tories, even those practically demented by the idea of no deal, backing that is nil. The Lib Dems have ruled it out. It would be a huge strategic error for the SNP. And thatrsquos before you take into consideration the fact that there could well be about  of Mr Corbynrsquos own MPs who wouldnrsquot vote for it.Mr Corbyn, despite not banging on about it in his meeting, is still apparently insisting that a vote would mean him becoming prime minister .I think a GNU would be undemocratic, undesirable and unlikely. But in a fantasy world where the proposed interim PM were Ken Clarke, or Harriet Harman, itrsquos just about possible. But you would need a vote of no confidence first. So the person best placed to bring it about is Jeremy Corbyn, and the biggest obstacle to it happening is Jeremy Corbyn.Small wonder the other leaders preferred to make it a last resort, trying instead to rule out no deal by legislation. The problem is that you canrsquot, with absolute certainty, for both practical and political reasons. Practically, because MPs have to vote for something, anything  to avoid what is otherwise the default position, and so far they canrsquot agree on what that would be. Eventhey could, therersquos no guarantee itrsquos anything thatrsquos on offer.:Will SNP efforts to unseat Lib Dems be enough for Shetland by-election victoryAnd while the no deal absolutists are as deluded as the revoke extremists, there are potential deals ndash and the one negotiated by Theresa May is one ndash clearly even worse than no deal. Thatrsquos why MPs voted it down three times.Politically, this approach is tricky because, while Boris Johnson says he would still rather have a deal, he is totally committed to exit by October . Just as his mind wonrsquot be changed by a vote saying MPs wonrsquot accept no deal, nor will such a vote magic away the fact that itrsquos the legal default. His opponents would also have to commit to some positive course of action to replace it: either the blatantly anti-democratic nuclear option of outright revocation, or acceptance of some deal that is actually on offer at the time. Or an election.By contrast, the PM has nothing to lose by calling an election. Therersquos a sporting chance he could win itwersquove left the EU, or would do so during the campaign, or at oncehe won. Therersquos the near-certainty that the Brexit Party would prevent him winninghe were to show the slightest sign of backing down on the date.This is now a game of chicken where everyone ndash Johnson, Corbyn, Remainers, Brexit absolutists, and the EU ndash believes that their only chance of getting what they want is not to blink.

The service is supported by Scottish Government funding of £. million over two years.In the last nine months, the Money Talk Team has helped a total of  people be better off by more than £ million – meaning households benefit by more than £, on average. A total of nearly  people have accessed the service.Launching a national advertising campaign to raise awareness of the Money Talk Team, Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said:“The Money Talk Team is making a huge dference to the thousands of families that have already taken advantage of this free service.“The friendly, experienced advisers talk callers through the options available, letting them know exactly what they are entitled to and helping them save money.“But there are still too many families out there not getting what they should be.“If you’re a parent struggling to pay the bills at the end of the month, you’re not alone. It doesn’t matteryou’re in or out of work, one call to the free phoneline is all it takes to get some advice that could be a massive help to your household.”Money Talk Team is the new name for Financial Health Check, which started in  and is delivered by Citizens Advice Scotland.

We went over my current benefits and discussed ious options. “I had been thinking about claiming Universal Credits but we worked out that I’d be five pounds worse off each weekI did. So it was reassuring to hear that I was doing the right thing. “We also ran through my loan repayments which were taking a third of my benefits each week.“Just by making a couple of calls I’ve managed to get an extra £ a week in my pocket which is more than enough to cover my monthly TV, broadband and mobile costs. “The team are friendly, helpful and the adviser properly listened. “I’ve now told both my sisters to call as I think it could really help them too.”Advice is available from the Money Talk Team on    and at local Citizens Advice Bureau.

The aim is for all recycling centres to reach % by .Up to  new staff are due to be in place by mid-September and will provide advice and assistance to householders about what can be recycled. The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk .

We are also the only party to respect the result of the  referendum vote to leave the EU and the  referendum result to stay part of the UK.#Perhaps Mr Brydon Goodlad could show how the UK is standing up for our fishing industry by publicising how many foreign boats will be removed from UK waters and how much additional quota will be available to UK fishermen as a result of these three agreements.If the Tories had their waythe sea#s would be sucked dry of any fish, and they would, probably, invite the USA to fish the waters as well, since we all know just how much the Tories love anything to do with the USA##.and privatization.

He is being represented by Conservative MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston.BBC Radio Shetland#s John Johnston is hosting the event, with all eight candidates being given a minute to introduce themselves and their policies before moving on to audience questions.Independent candidate Ian Scott provided an impassioned speech, saying that he has #stood specically steadfastly against the cuts, the Tories, the Liberal Democrats” before. He also reacted angrily to the news that Mr Goodlad could not be in attendance, shaking his head as Mr Halcro Johnston explained his absence.SNP candidate Tom Wills began by saying that #Shetland is ready for a change# and asked for  months to show what he can achieve in Holyrood, while Lib Dem competitor Beatrice Wishart opened her speech with a defiant message: #If you want an MSP who will speak up for Shetland, I’m your woman#.The first question of the night revolved around transport, with Ms Wishart and Mr Wills clashing immediately, interrupting each other#s answers as Mr Johnston appealed for both candidates to let the other finish.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to Mr Wills# five-point transport plan by saying that #Tom Wills has a load of great ideas but they won’t be delivered#, while independent candidate Ryan Thomson added that #nothing gets done” because “Shetland is the pawn” in mainland politics.Councillor George Smith directed a question at Mr Wills, asking him how he expected the SIC to afford one of his election pledges, free foot passengers on inter-island ferries.Mr Wills responded to say that this could be paid for #, and when# the Scottish government provided additional funding to the council.Mr Thomson criticised the NorthLink ferries in response to a question about increased capacity on the ferries. He focused his attack on the much-maligned sleeping pods, not for the first time, saying that we had been #lumbered# with these pods and said he was reticent to even call them pods, instead saying #it#s a chair#.#Bigger ships# and #daytime sailings# were potential solutions that Mr Thomson suggested as alternatives.On the subject of Brexit, only Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that he was in favour of Brexit, although he admitted that he voted to remain in the EU.Mr Scott and Mr Wills attacked the coalition of the Tories and the Lib Dems, with Mr Scott saying that the #Tories and Liberals approved austerity and that they had #turned to the racists and the fascists# which garnered wide applause.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to say it was #always very amusing listening to Ian but I’m afraid he’s wrong#, which was met negatively by the audience.Mr Wills said that the SNP #could stop Brexit#, and added thatthey were pulled out of the EU by Westminster then a vote for independence could put Scotland back into the European Union.He expanded on Mr Scott#s point by saying the #reason why people voted for Brexit is because of the coalition of Lib Dems and Tories which approved austerity# to a rapturous reception. Ms Wishart responded to the issue of Brexit to say that it was #time for a peoples vote and time for people to work together across parties# to stop Brexit.Scottish independence was the next topic up for debate, and understandably provoked perhaps the most isive reactions of the night.Mr Scott, Mr Wills and the Green Party#s Debra Nicolson all came out in favour of an independent Scotland, while Mr Halcro Johnston, Ms Wishart and independent Peter Tait were against it. Both independent candidates, Michael Stout and Ryan Thomson, said they would wait to see what benefit Shetland could get from Scotland becoming independent before deciding how to vote, should another referendum come up.Mr Scott#s positive attitude towards independence was because, he said, # nothing  we#ll get rid of these damned Tories#.Ms Wishart wanted the audience to #imagine the chaos#Scotland tried to break up the union, citing Brexit as an example. She said the vote was supposed to be #once in a letime# and that there were better priorities for funding, such as healthcare.Mr Wills responded to this point: #which has been cut by the Tory Liberal coalition#, to audience applause.Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that #I think SNP talk about independence because its easier than talking about their failings#, and added that nobody would be surprised to find that he was against independence.I#m sorry, Tom Wills is havering. Independence will not keep Scots in, or bring us back into, the EU. EvenBritain stays in, Scotland will leave, automatically, with #No Deal#, on Independence Day and will have to reapply to join. The EU has confirmed this, in writing.Also,nothing changes, our starting budget deficit will be £. billion per annumversus the EU#s limit of about £ billion . The UK will stop paying funding that.We shall have to cut spending raise taxes by some £ billion p.a. on an annual budget of about £ billion, to satisfy the EU#s economic conditions for joining.That means we shall face years of withering austerity, just when we need to spend more to stimulate the economy.We also need to set up our own independent central bank which the nationalist think tank #The Common Weal# says will take nine years from an Indy Yes vote. So we shall be out of the EU, with #No Deal#, for at least, seven years from Independence Day.Scots are canny folk. They will not vote for such an independence prospectus.John, your oft repeated notion that an independent Scotland will start with a budget deficit of £. billionis an entire fancy. Whatdebt an independent Scotland may have to take on as a share of the current UK#s debt, in the event of Scotland becoming independent, will be a matter for negotiation and agreement . Similarly, matters such as whether, and for what fees , the rest of the former UK might be permitted to retain its weapons of mass destruction on Scottish soil will be for negotiation agreement in the event of Scotland becoming independent.I would not hold my breath waiting for their answer.Ian Scott and Tom Wills have very selective memories. The austerity cuts introduced by the last Conservative  Lib Dem coalition were in response to the mess Brown and Blair made of the British economy. The outcome of this prudent handling of the deficit was obviously popular with the British people because David Cameron’s government won an overall majority in the subsequent election. David Cameron also delivered on another election pledge to have an in out referendum on Europe. How can the SNP criticise any party for that they have never delivered on an election pledge in their le. Finally, the only racism and fascism that has come out of this by-election has been promoted by the SNP anti-English racism. The SNP are Tartan Fascists.Had it not been for the global economic crisis, and Blair#s US led wars, Brown#s finances could have seen him becoming PM. This shows the harm in getting too friendly with the US, not that there will be much of a choice for the remnants of the UK after Brexit. I won#t digny John M Scott#s final comment with a response other than to note that it is Trump and Farage that have been too close to white supremacists. Happily neither seem that popular north of the boarder. The SNP promote an inclusive civic nationalism which can#t seriously be compared to that of the far right.##and the peril of getting too friendly with the EU is being dictated to and bled dry by a Union of Socialist Republics ruled by a Germanic Franco dictator, aided an abetted by a random collection of Belgians.Best off going it alone and not being shackled up to some #superpower#, either actual or wannabe.John M Scott#s remark reminds me of something a reviewer wrote in the Shetland News in : #The depths of ignorance are surely plumbed here#.It#s like I wasnt even there.No mention of Labours position on Brexit or Independence. Thanks guysYou#ll have to listen tonight folks, there isnt even any mention of VE which was discussedLabour has a position on Brexit!Where did you find out about this Johan @Brian Hill, It is you who fantasise, not I. I did not mention #national debt#. So let#s set aside the #smoke and mirrors#. I am talking about the £. billion gap between Scottish tax revenue raised last year and money received from Westminster. We have been running similar, sometimes larger deficits for many years. Unless something changes this will become our annual budget deficit on obtaining independence as Westminster will no longer fund the shortfall.Don#t take it from me. A couple of years back, the SNP#s own Sustainable Growth Commission conceded that we would start independence with a budget deficit of .% of our GDP, around £. billion per year, and proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to less than %, which just happens to be the EU#s maximum permissible limit. @Brian Hill, Ok,we are to be pernickety:The UK funds the dference between our tax revenues and what Holyrood receives from the Exchequer so we are talking about a so-called #notional deficit# that has been ongoing for many years.This is recognised by the SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission.UK funding will cease on Independence Day and the notional deficit will become , our budget deficit.The current UK funding of £. billion equates to around £ per head of population, per year. With independence that money will have to be found where # borrowing or tax hikes # or cut from public services.#John, as Scotland is not yet independent then it cant have been running a deficit for any#, what utter nonsense. Since when did you have to be independent to go broke  Try telling that one to your bank manager. Dr Craig Dalzell! who  wings over Scotland! still based in England, hard to make it up but you manage it Brian.John, I#m sorryit appeared pernickety, but my fundamental point was that you cant predict the future finances of any putative future independent Scotland based on the notionalaccounts of a devolved Scotland within the current UK state. No amount of repetition of thosefigures alters the arguments.Brian,You#re putting words in my mouth. I#m not attempting to predict future finances. Merely, observing that we would start from a very bad place, losing the £. billion annual UK funding.But please, don#t take it from me.The SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission propose a multi-year programme of deficit reduction and Oxford University Professor Gallacher has studied the most recent figures. He concludes: #Any more realistic look……. starting from Scotland’s actual fiscal position, swtly shows…….would quickly amass unsustainable levels of debt, and the cost of servicing it would require large cuts in public services. #….today’s relatively high spending is supported by large UK fiscal transfers, and to avoid cutting it large borrowing would be needed. #That swtly adds up to very large debt, which cannot be afforded. #All this strategy would achieve is to delay the inevitable big cuts in spending until Scotland is heavily indebted and so has to make even more cuts.#Paraphrasing your own words, Brian, #No amount of SNP preication can alter the facts.#I#m no economist by any stretch of the imagination. But could we not use the £bn+ that Westminster uses in defence, HS , bribing the DUP , or building a #national# stadiumon our behalf, to subsidise the #deficit# Those are the more optimistic contentions which I take from the Commission#s report, as to what can be done when an independent Scotland takes full control of its own resources.."},{"url":null,"title":"electoral showdown draws closer ","story":"Preparations are well in advance for this week#s by-election, with council staff readying the floor for Thursday#s electoral showdown.In all,  staff, including presiding officers, polling clerks and information officials will be on hand during this week#s vote.Twenty-eight polling places are being opened, containing a total of  polling stations.The Gilbertson Park Games Hall in Lerwick will have seven polling stations set up for , voters.In contrast, the Uyeasound hall in Unst will open its doors to  voters.Over  voters could walk through the doors of the Scalloway hall to cast their vote.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

You could see smoke and a small bit of flames coming out of the car, I knew the engine was on fire.“Sean and I were straight over to him and told him he needed to get out of the car. He had no idea what was going on. “We got him out of the car and pushed it off the road. We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College.

Although a seemingly simple step, tapping into the natural springs below the bar has revealed interesting information about the geography of the area and, as owner Martin Caldwell explains, has created further links to the Speckled Hen’s -year history.“Right under our feet is the Triassic Aquer, which stretches from the Castlereagh to Black Mountain,” he said.“There has always been a well under the bar, so given that we’re filtering our own water anyway, it made sense to put in a chiller, a cooler and a carbonator to make fizzy water too.“There was originally a well there and the previous owner had tapped into it. During the winter time you can actually see little springs coming up out in the carpark. There used to be a well where our beer garden is now where they used to dip the buckets for water. The pub goes back to , so it goes back a fair while. They used to brew their own beers and everything here, so access to spring water was vital.”He continued: “It’s fantastic that a place of this age is still ing and providing hospitality and services. This used to be the old post road and was also one of the main roads to Dublin at the time, so coaches used to stop along here. It was actually alleged that Daniel O’Connell stopped here before. It would have had to have been self-sufficient. We’re essentially going back to the notion of our own self-sufficiency in terms of the supply of water as well.”The Speckled Hen started bottling its water last month, installing a new filtration system that provides fresh four-times-filtered water for its customers. The water is, of course, filtered through the rocks on its journey across the mountains that, according to Queen’s University researchers, began , to , years ago. As for the punters, Martin says they see it as a “great novelty”.“They’re getting their draft beer and now they are getting draft water, he said.“The kids come in and want cordials or juices, so now well ask themthey want still or fizzy water – they think it’s a great novelty getting the fizzy water in the cordial.”While making connections with the pub’s past, Martin and his team are also looking to the future with the installation of farming allotments that will provide fruit, veg and more for it’s kitchens in the years to come."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37264874.ece/36493/BINARY/primarknew010.jpg","title":"chamber chief hails creative thinking shown following belfast primark inferno","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It led to many months of disrupted business for retailers and shoppers in the area after a cordon was put in place around the unsafe building. \"We all really felt it,\" he said.Read MoreClaire McNeilly: Why do we still not know how Belfast Primark fire started In October alone footfall was down % on the year before. Fast food restaurant City Picnic closed on the day of the fire and hasnt been opened since, though hopes to be open again by the autumn. Others such as Pizza Boutique struggled on for a time after the cordon was reduced, only to also shutter their premises completely.Primark opened two stores, one at the back of its Bank Buildings shop and another on Donegall Place - though it is also planning a restoration of Bank Buildings. Fashion chain Zara was closed for around seven months, thanks to its close proximity to Bank Buildings.Mr Rana said the first impact had been to galvanise organisations in the city to work together with a greater sense of urgency than ever before. \"There was Belfast City Council, then ourselves in the Chamber, then the other business-type organisations like Belfast City Centre Management and also the Department for Communities, and Translink.\"It did throw us together and resulted in a great deal of co-ordination and co-working. Its probably strengthened that relationship and added impetus to work together.\"That led to initiatives to draw people into the city centre around Christmas, such as a winter-themed slide in Royal Avenue and stalls selling fast food. And a kids play park was also installed in Castle Place.Mr Rana said: \"The animation that the council provided in the peak Christmas season meant the city was very busy, and that did attract people into the city that probably hadnt been in recently. data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  Aerial view over Bank Buildings following Tuesdays fire.

Discussions are taking place, too, about pedestrianisation and improving public transport into and around the city. Mr Rana - whose company Andras House owns a string of hotels in the city - said the crisis of the fire had led to creative thinking. \"I would say it did stimulate new ideas to try things, which dont always work but its good to try them. \"It certainly has highlighted the importance of the city centre. When it wasnt ing we all really felt it.\"He said retail was the biggest pull into the city centre, but that the night-time economy and the drive to get more people living in it were also a big part of planning its future. And he said retail in Belfast centre - despite the well-publicised dficulties of the sector as a whole - was performing well.\"Weve had a new store, Anthropologie, opening in Arthur Street two Primark shops opening and CastleCourt Shopping Centre has a new Matalan, which does very well. \"And in Belfast, we still have our big-brand retailers like House of Fraser, Debenhams and Marks  Spencer - retailers which have closed stores in other city centres.\"And he said other parts of the city centre were being redeveloped, such as a site close to Smithfield Market and the Tribeca development around the Cathedral Quarter. The Tribeca name has attracted objections as its also the name of a district in New York. But Mr Rana said he did not object to the name. \"The name gives definition to the area and at the end of the day, the priority isnt the name but making sure development starts, proceeds and benefits the city centre.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

leaders in Paris on Wednesday, Simon Coveney, who is also the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that the current stance of the British government was asking the EU to disregard the proposed backstop arrangement on “the back of a promise”.“We have a British government who seems to be wiping the slate clean on the Irish issue,” Mr Coveney said.“We must ensure that the commitments that took two years to negotiate to deal with the complexity of those issues on the island of Ireland are actually followed through on.Were not going to compromise on a peace process that is fragile right now on the island of IrelandSimon Coveney“Unfortunately what we are hearing today from the British Minister for Brexit is that Britain no longer seems to be committed to that approach, which we know solves the problem at hand, and instead wants everyone to move forward and agree on the basis of a promise that we would try and deal with these issues at some point in the future.“We can’t give up on something that we know works on the back of a promise without any idea as to how it’s going to work.“We can never sign an agreement with that approach, we’ve always saidthere is to be a no-deal Brexit, it will be the choice of a British prime minister and British government that will make that happen.“We’re not going to compromise on a peace process that is fragile right now on the island of Ireland.“A peace agreement that has saved lives and that has created normality between communities that in the past were in conflict.”Asked whether he was surprised the Prime Minister Boris Johnson

Johnson is due to come to Dublin in early September, so that meeting is going to happen soon,” he said.“It would be wrong to say the British and Irish governments haven’t spoken, I have spoken to Steve Barclay a number of times, I’ve spoken to Dominic Raab and Julian Smith, so there is of course an ongoing conversation between Britain and Ireland – but that isn’t delivering an agreement.“This is a decision between Britain and the EU collectively, we spent many months putting together a Withdrawal Agreement which was a compromise on both sides in order to get a fair deal for the UK and acceptable to the EU.”At the same event, the Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said the UK Government is “aiming for a deal” but ready for a hard Brexit.“The British Government are aiming for a deal,” he said.“A deal that honours the Belfast Good Friday Agreement but without the backstop, as the UK Parliament has made clear.“That is what our Government seeks and, with goodwill on all sides, it is what we can deliver.”"},{"url":null,"title":"woman gives evidence against four accused of human trafficking","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

What  can I do without the money, without support ...WitnessOn arrival in Glasgow, she said she and her sister ed their ID cards to Ms Cicova as “we don’t know where we are, we don’t have any money and we were a bit worried”.She said they were concerned about “what we will do, what will happen to us”.The witness said they were taken to Ms Cicova’s flat in Glasgow, where  people lived, but only worked for two days at a pizzeria and gave the  euro they earned to her to pay for food.Ms Cicova later told them there was no job in Glasgow and offered to marry them off but did not say to who, the witness said.She said she asked why she should get married to someone she did not know and did not love.“She told us we must get married and I was afraid at that time, especially afraid for my sister. She can throw us away or something  can happen to us,” the witness added, saying she was also worried thatshe was thrown out she would be detained by the authorities.She said she agreed because she had “no other choice” and went with Ms Cicova and her sister to Gombar’s nearby home where two Pakistani men were waiting.She said she was informed one of the men wanted to find a bride for his son and wanted to choose “the older one”, which was her.Overnight, she said she heard Gombar tell Ms Cicova that the woman had “made good business” and said in her police statement that Gombar said he would receive , eurofor the wedding but would not give her the money and would split it with Ms Cicova.The witness said the next day she flew to Dublin with Ms Cicova on flights paid for by the Pakistani men, and on arrival £, was placed on a table for Ms Cicova, before she left early the following morning.The court heard the witness lived with her future husband and his relatives at a house in Co Meath and could only communicate through hand signals.The pair were married in  and when asked by an interpretershe was forced into the marriage, the witness said she had told the official no but said to the court that this was a lie.Asked why she went through with the marriage, she said: “I was forced. What  can I do without the money, without support, I don’t have anyone there.”After the wedding, her husband gave her £, and she ed to Slovakia but flew back the same day to orce him.Ronnie Renucci QC, representing Gombar, put to the witness that she never met Gombar in Glasgow, which she denied.He put to her that Ms Cicova suggested getting married to earn money and the witness replied she did not get any money from her.The witness said a police statement saying her future husband gave her , euros on arrival in Ireland was incorrect, and it was placed in front of Ms Cicova.The police statement also said her husband had told her he needed a visa to stay in Ireland.He gave her  euros the day before and after the wedding, the witness said.Questionedshe agreed to marry him for a visa in exchange for money, she said: “I didn’t ask him for money and I didn’t know why the marriage was taking place.”The accused are said to have worked from at least three properties in Glasgow, as well as premises around the UK, France, Slovakia and Ireland.More than  women are said to have been trafficked, mostly from Slovakia, to be exploited in the UK or where.Gombar faces  charges, Wagle faces six, Sandorova faces , and Adam faces , all of which they deny.The trial, before Judge Lord Beckett, continues."},{"url":null,"title":"is queens speech plan legit or has boris gone prorogue","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The current session, which started on June ,  with the last State Opening and Queen’s Speech, has been the longest in history.– Who does it The Queen formally prorogues Parliament following guidance from the Privy Council,  which is her body of advisers made up mainly of senior politicians.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  – Why does Boris Johnson want to prorogue Parliament now A new Government brings with it new plans and legislation which are set out in a Queen’s Speech. Mr Johnson insists he asked the Queen to end the current session of Parliament so he can start anew.– What happens during prorogation While Parliament is prorogued, MPs and peers cannot formally debate policy and legislation or make any laws of their own.Parliamentary scrutiny is suspended and the powers of the Houses of Commons and Lords are effectively taken away until the next Queen’s Speech.– How long will Parliament be prorogued for Prorogation normally tends to be for a short amount of time – no longer than two weeks, with it leading to either a general election or the start of a new Parliamentary session.Under the new plan, Parliament will be dissolved no earlier than September  and no later than September , until the Queen’s Speech on October .Parliament had been due to break for its conference recess for at least two weeks in the lead up to October, even before the news of the prorogation broke, with Number  arguing that MPs are only losing an extra four sitting days in total.Mr Johnson said there would still be “ample time” for MPs to debate Brexit in the second half of October.– So why has the move sparked such anger There have been fears for a number of months that, should the Government not be able to strike an exit deal with the European Union, the Prime Minister could look to prorogue Parliament to prevent MPs from attempting to stop the UK leaving without a deal.Critics believe this is what he is doing now. Senior opposition figures and Tory opponents of a no-deal Brexit met on Tuesday to draw up plans to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without an agreement. A day later the PM has effectively moved to curtail their time to draw-up legislation that would prevent Britain from exiting without a Withdrawal Agreement signed-off.– So could a snap general election still be on the cards Commentators saw the surprise announcement that Chancellor Sajid Javid will set out Whitehall spending budgets next week as a sign that the new administration was ramping up plans for an early election.But inviting the monarch to Parliament for the pomp and ceremony of the Queen’s Speech on October  would be an odd thing to dothe PM is actually planning a snap election.However,opposition and rebel Tory MPs unite behind a no-confidence motion against the Government in retaliation against the plans to prorogue, that could force Parliament into a stalemate where a general election is the only resolution."},{"url":null,"title":"what is privy councils role over the suspension of parliament","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It dates from the time of the Norman kings when the monarch met in private – hence the description Privy – with his or her group of trusted counsellors who fulfilled the role that the Cabinet performs today.– What does it do As well as advising the Queen it provides administrative support for the leaders of the Commons and Lords. It also has responsibility for the affairs of  institutions, charities and companies incorporated by Royal Charter. The body also has a judicial role as it is the court of final appeal for the UK overseas territories and Crown Dependencies, and for a number of Commonwealth countries. It also has a number of important executive s – Parliament is dissolved by proclamation approved by the Queen in Council and the monarch formally prorogues Parliament on the Council’s advice.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jacob Rees-Mogg is a member of the Privy Council – What is the ceremony for becoming a Privy Counsellor Tradition stipulates on being appointed to the post new members affirm an oath of allegiance, kiss the Queen’s hand – and here it is believed they kneel as they do so – then affirm a Privy Counsellor oath. New members sworn in after Mr Johnson became Prime Minister included Jacob Rees-Mogg who became Lord President of the Council as he is now Leader of the Commons.– Who are its members There are around  Privy Counsellors who take an oath of confidentiality and members are styled Rt Hon. All the Cabinet are members along with some middle-ranking ministers, senior judges, figures from the Commonwealth and the leader of the opposition. An inidual becomes a counsellor for le, although their role may diminish over time.– When are Privy Council meetings held The Privy Council meets around once a month with the gatherings held at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle or, occasionally, Balmoral. The meetings are held by the Queen with a Clerk of the Council and usually around four ministers, with the discussions unusually held standing up to ensure they do not last too long.The Prime Minister has asked the Queen to suspendParliament in the nd sitting week of September. How does #proroguing Parliament work  And what are the consequences  Our recent briefing explains what you need to know https:t.co fFilJGQUCy #prorogation— Commons LibraryAugust , What powers does the Queen use to prorogue Parliament The monarch uses “prerogative powers” which allow her to suspend the sitting of the Commons and the Lords but by convention she follows the advice of her ministers. There are some prerogative powers where she could,she chose, act freely – like the appointment of a prime minister and the dissolution of Parliament, but this is unlikely.Some MPs have launched a Scottish legal challenge to the suspension – could the Queen be dragged into the courts The Queen’s actions cannot be challenged but the advice she received from Mr Johnson can be, possibly on the grounds the Prime Minister did not understand, and so did not properly apply, the rules governing proroguing.– What is the Queen’s Speech The Queen’s Speech sets out the Government’s agenda for the coming session of parliament, outlining proposed policies and legislation. It is delivered by the monarch during the State Opening of Parliament which marks the formal start of the parliamentary year.– Does the Queen write the speech The Queen remains politically neutral and above party politics so the speech is written by the Government."},{"url":null,"title":"rare baby wildebeest born at newquay zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

downer,” said Tom Brevoot, the issue’s editor.Mr Brevoot said he gave the issue’s dozens of creators general guidance, but also the freedom to explore a character or storyline in a single page.Many of the pages adopt what Mr Brevoot called a “confessional” approach where a character is speaking to an interviewer.The page for  features superheroes’ answers to “What do you regret,” or another in which Deadpool takes a little too long to answer one of the issue’s recurring questions, “Why do you do what you do ”Mr Brevoot said: “Evenyou don’t like every single page, there’s another page right after it that’s dferent.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The cover of Marvel Comics #, the publisher’s th anniversary issue The artistic styles range from the simpler drawings of early comics to the hyper-detailed style of some contemporary titles.There are numerous guest writers, including authors Neil Gaiman and Brad Meltzer, basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabar and film directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.Mr Brevoot said he enlisted people he knew were fans of Marvel comics with the aim of adding a “cool flavour” to some of the pages and “show the reach that Marvel has had over  years that you don’t really see”.Controversy emerged on Tuesday after The Hollywood Reporter posted a story noting that the text on Captain America’s page representing  had been altered from an early version that pointed to inequalities in America and flaws in its systems.The revised text has Captain America talking about fighting injustice and how hatred, bigotry and exclusion are not patriotic values.Marvel did not comment on the changes and interviews for this story were completed before the Reporter’s story was posted.I definitely wanted this to be a range of experiences and not have it be an -page chucklefestTom Brevoot, issue editorWhile many of the pages are one-offs, about a quarter of the issue is devoted to a storyline that traces back to Marvel’s infancy about a trio of men trying to harness the power of a black mask that has been passed down for centuries.Whoever wears the mask gains powers that give them a fighting chance against even the strongest superheroes.Before Marvel , the trio called the Three Xs appeared in only a single Marvel issue from .While other characters from Marvel’s early days have been reimagined, writer Al Ewing said the old story of the Three Xs “had something very familiar about it” and provided a seed to bring a broad story that fit not only the anniversary issue, but one that will continue in upcoming comics.Mr Ewing, who is credited as the issue’s “mastermind”, said he scoured old Marvel issues to make sure there were enough bread crumbs that Marvel  could go back and find later.“I didn’t want to do too much that readers couldn’t go and hunt down themselves,” Mr Ewing said.Most of Marvel’s vast catalogue is now available digitally through its Marvel Unlimited subscription, making research for Mr Ewing, and fans, easier.At its core, Mr Ewing said he hopes readers walk away with an understanding about what it means to be a Marvel hero.“We talk a lot about kings, and there are quite a few Marvel heroes who are kings,” he said.“But we also talk about the other side of that, the hero that rises from the commonality of humanity, the hero who could be you.”"},{"url":null,"title":"toyota and suzuki announce selfdriving car

It featured dramatic images of the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights march in , alongside work on the Northern Irish civil rights struggle, from the first march in August  to the Battle of the Bogside in .Picturing Derry brought together some of the most iconic images from the Troubles and the most recent exhibition explored anxieties around Brexit which were part of a series of cross-border projects.Local artists were also regularly showcased at the gallery.Earlier this year plans to build a whiskey distillery in Ebrington fell through.But last week positive news emerged of plans to build two Grade A office blocks and a -apartment retirement village at the Waterside site.The Nerve Centre was contacted for comment regarding the gallery’s closure but did not respond at the time of going to press.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"new cain documents highlight unresolved political issues","story":"A new batch of documents added to Ulster University’s CAIN archive demonstrate how important issues affecting Northern Irish politics twenty years ago remain pertinent today.The newly released material provides a valuable insight into the period between -, mostly notably in relation to the Brooke Mayhew talks.In addition, it also charts developments in Anglo-Irish relations for these years, ongoing discussions around ious political and security matters, as well as important issues such as fair employment, the Irish language and community relations.The Brooke Mayhew negotiations took place to secure “a new, more broadly based agreement” which would replace the Anglo Irish Agreement.On the  March, , the first roundtable negotiations, excluding Sinn Fein, took place in an attempt to end the political stalemate in N.I., and continued through to November .Although they appeared to achieve little the Brooke Mayhew talks were the first to have \"three strands\", the relationships within Northern Ireland, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between London and Dublin. A basis had been laid for future discussions.The CAIN website, whose workers are based at the Magee campus in Derry, provides an extensive range of information and source material on the conflict and politics from  to the present day.The site is used by a worldwide audience and has received more than  million visits since it was launched in March .Earlier this year, the Derry News revealed that it was under threat of closure but thanks to a staunch defence of the site mounted by academics and researchers, Ulster University announced a nine-month reprieve while funding options are explored.Around  documents relating to the years  and  have been added to the CAIN website as part of ongoing work involving the Ulster University and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland .The latest additions will bring to more than , the number of PRONI records available on CAIN.Dr Brendan Lynn, CAIN Deputy Director, said the archive is delighted to have been able to continue its cooperation with PRONI and to update the existing section with material dealing with the years  and .Mr Lynn commented: “CAIN has always sought to work with and iniduals, groups and organisations with relevant information relating to the Northern Ireland ‘troubles’ in order to make it available on-line.“An obvious example of this has been the partnership that CAIN has developed with The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland . As the official archive for Northern Ireland, one of PRONI’s many responsibilities is to receive government records from the early s onwards and to make them available for researchers.“The development of ‘PRONI Records on CAIN’ therefore provides people with an opportunity to gain access to a selection of material from the official files, that to date, chart the period from  to .“Looking ahead both CAIN and PRONI hope to continue this work to enable researchers to examine the events and personalities involved in the evolving ‘peace process’ of the s which culminated with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April .”‘Political stalemate’In terms of the latest documents, one of the most striking features of this material is that some of the issues which are so prominent today are the same ones which confronted politicians and policy makers back then.“For instance the search for an end to the political stalemate in Northern Ireland was dominated by a series of long, drawn out discussions – often referred to as the Brooke Mayhew talks of -. Whilst these were ultimately to end in failure they did leave behind an important template that was to be used at a later date,” Mr Lynn added.Dr Michael Willis, PRONI Director, has welcomed the publication of previously secret records through a continuing partnership between PRONI and Conflict Archive on the INternet .He said: “PRONI’s mission is to identy, preserve and promote public access to Northern Ireland’s archival heritage.“This latest addition of official documents to the CAIN website enhances the opportunity to view and read key documents from the time.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear. When the little elephant rockers were broken, the council just came and took them away but they werenrsquot replaced.She said that the play arearsquos summer seats were only replaced on one occasion after local vandals burnt them and had have not been replaced for years.Mrs Jess said that the community has done its best to keep the play park safe by sweeping away any broken glass and rubbish and have raised money for equipment in the past.The play facility caters for a large numbers of families at Millbank Grove Windmill Gardens, Windmill Drive, Windmill View, Carlisle Park and further afield, added Mrs Jess.Cllr Andrews said that he welcomed the residentsrsquo invitation to come along and to find out about the play facility.He said: ldquoThe play facility at Hillfoot Crescent serves a big catchment area with new developments being built in recent years.ldquoI was very impressed by the excellent turnout of parents, neighbours and children to convey their frustrations, worries and concerns about the condition of the existing playground here and the sense of being forgotten about.ldquoThey are calling for an upgrade to state of the art play parks that others in the Rowallane District Electoral Areahave been supplied with in recent times.ldquoI was able to tell them that Hillfoot Crescent is included in the line-up for an upgrade to new state of the art equipment.ldquoI will be lobbying and supporting this call at council level for this much-needed new play park to go ahead speedily along with those for Darragh Cross and Kilmore.The councillor said the council will encourage local residents and children to have their say and input into the new playground.He was presented with a heart-felt plea from the children for their park to be improved which was written as a poem and presented to him.It read: ldquoOur park is dying, itrsquos so sad, No one cares that it looks so bad.A lick of paint a bench or two, A modern slide area all overdue, So come on Council what do you say  Help us out and let us play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to clean up Mary Street area of Crossgar  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a clean-up of the Mary Street area in Crossgar.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews have highlighted the need for the work to be carried out following a recent visit to the village.Mr McGrath mdash who was in Crossgar along with Cllr Andrews to listen to residentsrsquo concerns mdash is keen to see a resolution to the issues in Mary Street.ldquoPaths at this part of the village have become very poorly neglected and a dumping ground for some, the MLA explained.ldquoThis is totally unacceptable at a location adjacent to residentsrsquo garages and homes and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Mr McGrath suggested that the Mary Street problems are indicative of a wider issue people and groups across the country are going to have to get to grips with mdash determining who is responsible for certain pockets of land.He continued: ldquoBy the time it takes to actually determine ownership of areas, the issue could have been sorted multiple times over.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles.

However, just hours before it was due to start someone painted lsquoIRA on the wall in front of the nearby Pilson Hall.The spokesperson revealed that when the graffiti appeared last week they contacted a specialist cleaner to have it removed and were prepared to meet the financial cost. However, the businessman agreed to do the work for free.ldquoNo one in Mount Crescent or Bridge Street wants sectarian graffiti. It does not reflect the good people who live at this part of the town, the spokesperson declared.ldquoWe were left disgusted at what happened given that we are working hard to promote our area and secure new investment, just like many other community groups across Downpatrick. This despicable act was not done in our name and we condemn those responsible.ldquoWe are not prepared to let those responsible have a negative impact on the good people, from all religions and races, who live at this part of Downpatrick.

We cannot emphasis enough that what happened was not done on our name and we condemn those behind this. We will not let people tarnish the work that we are doing or the good name of the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.ldquoWe hope the fact that we took steps to contact a specialist cleaner when we were made aware of the graffiti speaks volumes about our views on this matter. Those responsible are clearly not aware of what we are about and the respect we have for all our neighbours across Downpatrick.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe will not allow what happened to drive a wedge between us and others. If those responsible hoped the finger of blame would be pointed at us, they have failed.

Their unique wing structure along with their light weight enables them to go to places that other land-based mammals would find unmanageable. Their limbs are highly modied for flight, so they find it dficult to move around on the ground. When they are not flying, they rest hanging upside down from a tree branch using their sharp claws.Roosting in caves, trees or draught-free buildings each species has their own preferred roost, usually near its main food source. They eat insects including moths and midges, so are considered a very important natural pest controller. Echolocation aids their navigation when hunting for prey on the wing at night. Bats are creatures of habit, ing to their favourite roost each year..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Northern Ireland has eight species of bats, all protected by European law. Apart from being incredible little animals to watch, bats are a valuable part of nature across the UK and can be a very welcome visitor to our gardens. Sadly, though, they’re becoming increasingly rare in the UK. Like so many other animals, a gradual loss of habitat and roost sites are making numbers decline at an alarming rate. As old trees are cut down, buildings disturbed and mines filled in, bats are left with very few natural roost sites. Making sure our gardens are thriving insect-rich feeding grounds for bats can help a lot. And, just as we do with nestboxes for birds, we can also provide alternative roost sites for bats in the form of bat boxes. You can find out more information on how to help bats via our website . So while our Belfast Bat Walk is done for another year, we have another fantastic event taking place in Enniskillen in September. What better date for a ‘Bat Detectives’ guided walk than Friday the th  It’s a great opportunity to learn more about bats, to see and hear them and immerse yourself in their world. There will be a short introductory talk about bats followed by a night-time walk using bat detectors to identy the dferent species living in Enniskillen town centre. Tickets are £ per adult, £. per child and free for all RSPB members.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to .. Employees A total of , people are employed by Northern Ireland’s Top  Companies, a decrease from , employed by the companies in the  listing. Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies. NOTES A date of the June ,  has been used as the cut-off for the filing of accounts for the inclusion in this year’s Ulster Business Top .

Short Brothers files in dollars, while KN Networks Ltd and Lakeland Dairies Ltd files in euros. To allow for fair comparison their financial results have been amended to reflect the currency value at their financial year-end. .

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
