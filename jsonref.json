He branded him a ‘racist’, a ‘conman’ and a ‘cheat’ who only ran for office ‘on a platform of hate and intolerance’ to enhance his personal brand, not to make America great again.In a withering personal character assessment, Cohen said of the President: ‘He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal.’It was a savage takedown, and Cohen clearly relished his moment in the global media spotlight.          Cohen repeatedly cried he spoke again and again of his family, his loss, and fears for prisonHe repeatedly turned on the tears he spoke again and again of his family, of his loss, of his fears for prison life.Several times, he even evoked the memory of father of surviving the Holocaust ‘thanks to the compassion and selfless acts of others’ to explain why he, Michael, himself now always instinctively helped those in need.‘As many people that know me best would say, I am the person they would call at 3am if they needed help.’All of this was very carefully orchestrated and designed to make us feel sorry for him. Cohen, he was keen for us to know, is a massively misunderstood guy someone who did bad things but is not actually bad.  He even evoked the memory of father of surviving the Holocaust. All of this was very carefully orchestrated and designed to make us feel sorry for himMichael Cohen begins hours of secret testimony to House...Bitter Michael Cohen told CNN in 2016 that he would...\u0027He is lying in order to reduce his prison time\u0027: Trump...Michael Cohen reveals how he hunted for nonexistent...Share this articleA man whose only real crime was trying too hard to help people like Donald Trump at great personal risk to himself.I found myself laughing out loud at Cohen’s painfully insincere performance, not least because his own lawyer Lanny Davis was sitting right next to him looking like the cat that got every dollop of cream.Davis, of course, is best known for being one of the closest confidants and advisors to the Clintons.He took this gig for free, Cohen revealed.No sh*t, Sherlock!Davis – who I know well and respect as a brilliant political operator - would have paid to do it, such is his intense dislike of Trump, keenness to exact revenge for Hillary, and love of media attention.But there was just one big problem with Cohen’s testimony, and it was perfectly highlighted when he was posed a very simple question.‘How long did you work in the White House?’ asked Republican rottweiler Jim Jordan.‘I never worked in the White House,’ replied Cohen.‘That’s the point isn’t it, Mr Cohen?’ sneered Jordan.‘No, sir.’‘Yes it is.’‘You wanted to work in the White House, ‘‘No sir.’‘You just didn’t get brought to the dance.’‘I was extremely proud to be personal attorney to the President of the United States of America. I did not want to go to the White House.’  After being accused of feeling slighted he was brought to \u0027the dance,\u0027Cohen said under oath, ‘I was extremely proud to be personal attorney to the President of the United States of America. I did not want to go to the White House’The moment he said those words, Twitter exploded – led by many people closest to President Trump.‘Michael was lobbying EVERYONE to be Chief of Staff,’ tweeted Eric Trump. It was the biggest joke around the office. Did he just perjure himself again?’His brother Donald Jr agreed: ‘Hahahaha, Michael Cohen begged to work at the White House and everyone knows it.’ He added: ‘It really was the biggest joke of the entire transition. The beginning of his bitterness when he realized that was never going to happen. #Delusional.’Now, you might expect Trump’s sons to spring to his defence and brand Cohen a liar – again.What would be far less predictable is that CNN, Trump’s least favourite news organisation, did the same.          When Cohen said he didn\u0027t want to work in the White House, Twitter exploded. Cohen himself even said he\u0027d wanted to work in the White House During a panel debate about Cohen’s testimony, CNN’s top political correspondent Dana Bash said: ‘The one potential problem that I thought Michael Cohen has is when he was asked if he wanted a job in the White House and he said no. Our reporting….all of us have been told by people in and around the process at the time he very much wanted a job at the White House.’‘Very much,’ agreed CNN anchor Jake Tapper.Tapper then played the clip of Cohen’s claim ‘because a lot of us raised our eyebrows because we knew it to not to be true.’Afterwards, he added: ‘The issue is that one sentence ‘I did not want to go to the White House. All of our reporting suggests that’s not true.’Later in his testimony, Cohen doubled down and again said ‘I did not want to go to the White House’ and insisted he had told President Trump he wanted to continue working for him as an outside personal attorney.Yet CNN reported Cohen wanted a job at the White House but was edged out by Trump’s family, and was named personal attorney to mollify him.CNN said he had been particularly keen to be Chief of Staff and was ‘crushed’ when the job went to Reince Preibus instead.I think it’s safe to assume CNN, that despises Trump as much as he despises them, would not be reporting all this as a favour to the President. They reported it because it’s true.And we know it’s true because Cohen himself admitted as much in a CNN interview with Chris Cuomo in 2016.Asked if he expected to work with Trump when he moved to the White House, Cohen replied: \u0027Oh, I certainly hope so’, adding he would ‘a hundred per cent’ accept a position.So Cohen lied yesterday again, about something relatively innocuous.And if he lied about that, then what else did he lie about?Cohen says Trump sent him signed personal checks to pay off porn stars, but was it a retainer for general services?Cohen says he overheard Roger Stone tell Trump that Julian Assange had told him in a phone call that Wikileaks was about to dump their damaging Hillary emails. But both Stone and Assange have categorically denied any such conversation ever happened.Cohen says he heard Trump spew racist abuse as they travelled through a black neighbourhood in Chicago. But there is no tape (Cohen taped a lot of things) and no witness.Cohen says Trump was aware of the infamous Tower meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer. But the detail of how Trump was supposedly imparted this news is distinctly inconclusive.In the end, most of what Cohen revealed is stuff that has yet to be independently verified or corroborated, and some of it cannot be as only Cohen and Trump were there.If it’s all true, then President Trump is undeniably facing serious charges and may well have broken several laws.But as I watched Cohen’s pathetically manipulative, sniveling and disingenuous performance yesterday, I found it very hard to believe almost anything he was saying.  As I watched Cohen’s  manipulative, sniveling and disingenuous performance yesterday, I found it very hard to believe almost anything he was saying. Even CNN called out his lying‘Over the past two years, I have been smeared as “a rat” by the President of the United States,’ Cohen bleated. ‘The truth is much different.’Is it, Michael?A \u0027rat\u0027 is a word mob bosses use for those who betray them.The famous mafia rat of all was Salvatore ‘Sammy the Bull’ Gravano whose shocking plea deal testimony helped bring down John Gotti, head of the Gambino crime family.Gravano, a mass murderer involved in the killing of at least 19 people, squealed like a pig to save his own skin.But at least everyone believed him.In Michael Cohen’s case, he also made a plea deal in return for squealing like a pig about Trump.But how much of his testimony can we really trust?If he is still able to so obviously lie about a simple thing like wanting a job at the White House, how can we believe anything else he says?I’d be more inclined to believe Pinocchio than Michael ‘Sammy the Bullsh*tter’ Cohen.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Israels attorney general intends indict Netanyahu","story":"    Israel\u0027s attorney general intends to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (pictured) for bribery, breach of trust and fraud, reports in Israeli media claimToday Netanyahu\u0027s Likud party dismissed corruption allegations against him as \u0027political persecution\u0027. \u0027Unilateral publication of the attorney general\u0027s announcement just a month before the elections, without giving the prime minister an opportunity to refute these false accusations, is a blatant and unprecedented intervention in the elections,\u0027 the party said. \u0027We\u0027re talking about political persecution.\u0027  In one case, Netanyahu is accused of pursuing regulatory benefits allegedly granted to telecommunications firm Bezeq in exchange for positive coverage from a related media company. Israeli soldiers may have committed WAR CRIMES by killing...Estate of Nazi party member Oskar Schindler, who saved 1,200...Share this articleAnother involves Netanyahu allegedly seeking a secret deal with the publisher of Israel\u0027s top-selling newspaper Yediot Aharonot to ensure positive coverage in return for pushing forward a law that would have limited the circulation of a rival.The third case involves suspicions the premier and his family received luxury gifts from wealthy iniduals in exchange for financial or personal favours.  Under Israeli judicial procedures, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit is indicting Netanyahu pending a hearing. Police have recommended indicting Netanyahu, pictured with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, in three cases including alleged trading of favours with the media At the hearing the PM would be given an opportunity to defend himself before charges are filed. Some reports said Mandelblit would move to indict the prime minister for bribery, which a Netanyahu spokesman said would be \u0027ridiculous\u0027 and \u0027absurd\u0027.Likud joined a petition filed with the supreme court to stop Mandelblit from announcing his decision before the elections. The supreme court on Thursday afternoon rejected the petition, and Likud called the decision \u0027regrettable.\u0027  The 69-year-old has been prime minister for a total of around 13 years and he would be on track to surpass founding father David Ben-Gurion as Israel\u0027s longest-serving premier should he win in April.Netanyahu and his Likud party are facing a serious challenge from a centrist alliance led by respected former military chief of staff Benny Gantz.The agreement to form the alliance under the name Blue and White - the colours of the Israeli flag - has shaken up the campaign.  "},{"url":null,"title":"TOM LEONARD Andre Previns past legendary Lothario","story":"    Andre Previn, pictured with his American wife Mia Farrow, left, at Heathrow Airport in London along with their recently adopted Vietnamese daughter Kym His beautiful spouses included the actress Mia Farrow and renowned violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, whom he married when he was 73 and she 39. Some wondered what women saw in a small, stooped man with straggly hair, but Previn was undoubtedly a musical genius with immense charm and humour.For years arguably the most famous man in classical music, he possessed an astonishingly versatile talent — he was an accomplished jazz pianist who played with Ella Fitzgerald as well as a composer who could turn his hand to anything from opera and chamber music to pop. In concerts, he would play classical music before the interval and then switch to jazz.He was principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra in the Seventies and Royal Philharmonic in the Eighties, as well as guest conductor to most of the world’s great orchestras.Cover-up storm over baby deaths: Parents’ anger as probe...Dog walker, 71, is stabbed yards from Welsh lion enclosure...Share this articleHe was variously dubbed the ‘wunderkind in a turtleneck’ and the ‘Mickey Mouse maestro’ when he was in his 20s, by which time he was already being compared to the legendary Leonard Bernstein.But Bernstein never performed on the Morecambe And Wise Show. Previn’s famous turn in 1971 with Eric and Ernie involved the former attempting to play Grieg’s piano concerto under the baton of ‘Mr Andrew Preview’. Previn said London taxi drivers were still calling him ‘Mr Preview’ decades later.His real name is less well remembered. Born Andreas Ludwig Prewin, the precocious musician learned to play piano when he was five.          Previn, pictured here with Ted Heath was a former principal conductor of the London Symphony OrchestraHe and his Jewish family fled Berlin to escape the Nazis, and eventually ended up in Los Angeles. Previn, who exploited a family contact in the movie business, wrote his first musical arrangement when he was just 19 to accompany the barks of Lassie.‘I thought it was easy,’ he later said. ‘But I have since put myself through the wringer of watching it on a television rerun, and it’s the most inept score you ever heard.’Previn said he was used so much because he was ‘talented, fast and cheap’.In the Fifties, he was conscripted into the Korean War and was digging latrines when he heard that he had been nominated for his first Oscar for Gigi in 1958.During his stint in the military, he wrote arrangements for an army band and played in San Francisco jazz clubs.He went on to become a notorious Lothario but he hadn’t always charmed women. He related how the actress Ava Gardner, then 24, once suggested to the 16-year-old Previn that he take her home.Too innocent to understand what she meant, he thought she wanted him to call her a taxi.When they met again two years later, the now wiser Previn suggested they might go back to his place. ‘Go f*** yourself,’ she told him. ‘It’s one of the great sorrows of my life,’ he said years later.He proved immensely successful in Hollywood, writing more than 50 film scores and earning Academy Awards for Gigi, Porgy And Bess, Irma La Douce and My Fair Lady.Previn was 23 when he married his first wife, jazz singer Betty Bennett, with whom he had two daughters, Claudia and Alicia. Bennett would later claim that Previn could ‘entertain a girl for hours’, but that girl wouldn’t necessarily be his wife.          In Britain, Previn is most famous for his sketch with Morecambe and Wise in 1971 The marriage lasted five years before Previn orced her, just months before she gave birth to their second daughter.Two years later, in 1959, he married again. Dory Langdon was an aspiring lyricist and singer who saw him on TV and decided she had to meet him.The determined Ms Langdon got a job at MGM Studios, to which he was contracted, and they were soon a couple. They would go on to become a successful writing partnership, penning songs for Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and Tony Bennett.But after nearly a decade together, Previn left her for 25-year-old actress Mia Farrow, the winsome star of Peyton Place. He ended his marriage after Farrow became pregnant.Devastated, Dory recorded an album of searingly heartfelt songs about love and loss, including one titled Beware Of Young Girls. She was later diagnosed as schizophrenic and — literally — dragged screaming to a mental hospital, where she reportedly underwent electric shock therapy. She never publicly blamed Previn for the years she spent in and out of psychiatric institutions.          Previn, pictured with Mia Farrow in 1970 with their twin sons Matthew and SaschaFarrow, who was emerging from a short-lived marriage to Sinatra, was 16 years Previn’s junior. They married in 1970 — three years after he had turned his back on Hollywood to become a conductor. He became principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra in 1969 and they lived in rural Surrey and had three sons — twins Matthew and Sascha and Fletcher — as well as adopting four more children.One of those, Korean orphan Soon-Yi, was later to be at the centre of Farrow’s explosive split from Woody Allen, her next famous lover, after he started an affair with the young Soon-Yi, whom he later married.Previn’s wandering eye did not stop during his marriage to Farrow. Previn — who, in flares and mop-top floppy hair — looked more like a Beatle than a classical conductor, struck up a close relationship with a music critic named Gillian Widdicombe. During a rehearsal at the Royal Festival Hall, Farrow hit Widdicombe with her handbag and screamed: ‘Take that, you middle-aged groupie.’This time it was his wife who made the first move to end their marriage, with Farrow having an affair first with a Norwegian cameraman and later with Woody Allen.Although they orced in 1979, Previn would side with Farrow when the scandal over Allen and Soon-Yi broke. He cast Allen as a predator and said Soon-Yi had been helpless to resist his advances.          Previn, pictured in 1976, won four Oscars and was married five times He refused to talk to Allen for the rest of his life. And of Soon-Yi, Previn said: ‘She does not exist.’Previn was immensely successful at the LSO, bringing classical music to the masses. However, he stepped down in 1979 and three years later wed wife number four.His marriage to Heather Sneddon, daughter of a Foreign Office official and ex-wife of actor Michael Jayston, proved to be his longest.They had two children — Li-Ann, who was adopted, and Lukas — and Previn wrote a colourful memoir, No Minor Chords, which was edited by Jackie Onassis, by then a publisher.The marriage ended after 20 years, in 2002, when Heather cited irreconcilable differences. Her friends claimed Previn’s famous wandering eye had fallen on various women, including a soprano friend of Hillary Clinton. Previn blamed his ferocious ambition and the demands of his conducting career.          Previn, pictured in 2013, was nominated for three Oscars in 1961 Some men might have got the message by now that perhaps marriage wasn’t for them, but he was undaunted. That same year, he married German violin prodigy Anne-Sophie Mutter in a secret ceremony after they met when he wrote a violin concerto for her. They declared themselves ‘blissfully in love’ and moved into her mansion in Munich.Mutter, a fellow German, was famous for saying: ‘I have too much fire to ever be burnt out.’ But their marriage had fizzled out within four years.Friends said their 34-year age difference was to blame. ‘She is a lady with a full social and business itinerary, and word was that he couldn’t keep up,’ said a friend. Such a disdainful remark would have been a cruel blow to the workaholic Previn’s ego.While they may have begged to differ, Previn insisted that he remained close to all his wives. ‘I like them all,’ he once said. ‘We are the best of friends, which is very nice. I am pleased that there is no acrimony between us.’Certainly, he and Mutter continued to work together, with Previn churning out pieces for her to play. ‘You know how people say that their marriage didn’t work?’ he said in 2017. ‘With us, the orce didn’t work. We call each other every day regardless of where we are. It’s like being very best friends who have a romantic history.’Previn, associated with the LSO for more than 20 years, was knighted by the Queen in 1996 for his ‘outstanding contribution to Anglo-American cultural relations and the musical life of Britain’. But because he was not a British subject, the knighthood was only honorary and he was unable to call himself ‘Sir’. After his years in London, however, he remained an ardent Anglophile, even flying the British flag at his U.S. home.Nominated 14 times for Oscars, Previn was the only person in the history of the Academy Awards to earn three nominations in one year — 1961. Previn very publicly turned his back on Hollywood in favour of a classical career, but didn’t like being quizzed about it years later, especially if it was suggested the association had tarnished his serious music credentials.In 1991, he complained he had been focusing largely on classical music since the mid-1960s. He claimed there should be a ‘statute of limitations’ on still bringing up Hollywood. In the U.S., he said, the classical music world ‘would just as soon forgive you for an axe murder as for having done a movie’.Previn kept working furiously into later life, sometimes performing as both conductor and soloist in the same concert.‘I want more time to compose, I want more time to be at home and I want more time to do nothing,’ he said in 2005. ‘That’s the hardest thing to come by — just idleness.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"One five children set miss choice secondary school today","story":"    Official projections from last year show secondary pupil numbers were due to rise by more than 600,000 by 2023 (stock image)          Some said they stayed up until the early hours to find out only to be disappointed.

It’s an all-singing, all-dancing 2019 automatic A-class Mercedes-Benz Sport (stock photo)CrashFeeling a bit chilly? Just say: ‘Hey, Mercedes, I’m cold’ — and it will instantly switch on the heating. Apparently, it will even contact the emergency services of its own volition if I have a crash.Indeed, I’ve turned out to be such a sucker for these electronic bells and whistles that I feel honour-bound to resign my self-appointed life presidency of RANT (Rage Against New Technology), the organisation I founded on this page only six weeks ago.But don’t worry. Plenty of readers have written to me, volunteering for membership of the RANT board, and I’m sure that a more fitting successor can be found to fill my shoes.Enough to say that I’ve spent many thousands more than I intended on the self-indulgence of the Merc — which means that Mrs U and I will have many thousands less (if anything at all) to pass on to our progeny when we pop our clogs.Mind you, I’ve long had mixed feelings about the rights and wrongs of inherited wealth. As a dyed-in-the-wool Tory, I know I should be 100 per cent behind the idea of money cascading down the generations, from grandparents to parents and on to our own children.But there’s enough of the chippy egalitarian in me to recognise how very unfair it is that, say, the young Duke of Westminster earns more in the course of a good night’s sleep, thanks to his inherited billions, than great swathes of the world’s population take home from years of back-breaking toil.US offers a $1 million reward for Osama Bin Laden\u0027s son...Outrage as Florida man, 22, is given just 10 DAYS in jail...The man who put SEX into symphonies: To Brits, he was...Footy star Jack de Belin breaks his silence after being...Share this articleIn fact, the closet Bolshevik in my make-up wonders why our sons should get anything when we die (though to be fair, I ought to point out that they are the least mercenary of boys, who have never shown any sign of itching to get their hands on their dad’s dosh). This is particularly true to the Utley brand, since the sum total of my own inheritance from my late father on his death was one soup-stained tie, emblazoned with the arms of the Cambridge college we both attended.In my more mean-spirited moments, I reckon that if I didn’t get anything more than that, then why should my sons?At the same time, I tell myself that if Mrs U and I don’t spend the money we’ve earned, the taxman will only grab even more of it when it’s our turn for the crematorium, having already helped himself to great dollops of our income throughout our working lives.And it’s an indisputable truth that public authorities will always spend cash far more wastefully than even the most self-indulgent of Merc buyers. Think of the tens of billions squandered on such projects as HS2, aborted garden bridges across the Thames or the eye-wateringly expensive IT schemes for the NHS which came to nothing.At least my new car should get me from A to B — which HS2 shows no sign of doing for a good while yet, if it ever does at all. And that’s not to mention my heroic contribution to propping up the German car industry and its British suppliers.But still I feel a twinge of guilt over splashing out on my new toy. After all, it’s the most natural of instincts to want to look after our own flesh and blood.EqualI suspect that even Jeremy Corbyn, for all his claptrap about the importance of treating everyone as absolutely equal, would soon change his mind if he had to choose between saving the life of one of his own young or mine.Meanwhile, almost everyone reading this article has been a huge beneficiary of the hereditary principle. I have. By this, I mean that like the great majority of my readers, I inherited from my parents something too many of us take for granted — and it’s infinitely more valuable than a soup-stained college tie.Let’s face facts, it is not mainly through hard work or any special virtue of my own that I have access to clean water, free healthcare, home comforts and all the food and drink I need, denied to millions throughout the Third World.No, all these advantages came to me at birth, along with my British citizenship — handed down from parents to children through the generations, according to much the same principle that has given the Duke of Westminster ownership of some of the world’s most expensive real estate.It may not be fair that even the poorest Briton is hugely better off than the average Bangladeshi peasant, but we meddle at our peril with the idea of passing on wealth from one generation to the next.Which brings me to this week’s thought-provoking news that most Britons die without leaving anything to their families. According to an exhaustive study of wills left in England, six out of ten of us bequeath less than £5,000 — most of which is likely to be needed to pay for a funeral.SurgeWhat’s more, say the researchers at the London School of Economics, the proportion of those passing on significant sums when they die went unchanged at about 40 per cent between 1950 and 2016. This strongly suggests today’s young have yet to inherit the wealth accumulated by their elders after the surge in property ownership and house values during the second half of the 20th century.          Philip Hammond’s (pictured) latest wheeze is to increase the fees families must pay for the grant of probate, which gives them legal control of an estateVarious explanations spring to mind — the most obvious of which is that most of my own home-owning generation of baby-boomers have yet to die. The fact that we’re living longer also means our savings are being eaten away by such expenses as care home fees (not to mention the occasional rash purchase of a Mercedes-Benz).Another possible reason is that many who have money to spare pass their cash to their families before they die, setting up trusts and other schemes to avoid the grasp of that grimmest of reapers, the taxman. I can’t say I blame them, as successive chancellors greedily eye their wealth.Philip Hammond’s latest wheeze is to increase the fees families must pay for the grant of probate, which gives them legal control of an estate. Fixed up to now at a flat rate of £215, it will soon rise according to the value of the estate — although Labour are trying to block it.This stealth death tax means some 280,000 families a year could have to pay more, with 56,000 facing bills of between £2,500 and the maximum £6,000 — a hefty price for a piece of paper. With no fee charged on estates of less than £50,000, it’s little wonder if many of the rich do everything in their power to leave as little as they can.As for our own four sons, there will be no family trusts for them, poor lads. The best they can hope for is that their father dies before he can splash out on any more luxuries like the Mercedes. But even then they’ll have to wait, since my one-line will leaves everything I own to Mrs U.If they’re lucky, there might just possibly be something left over for them from the sale of the house when her turn comes. But they’ll have to play their cards right.I advise them to be very, very nice to their mum."},{"url":null,"title":"RICHARD LITTLEJOHN handing free condoms 60s","story":"    Our old friends at Public Health England have really done the bizzo this time.

They’re giving away packets of three at food banks?Stop it.‘Just nipping down the food bank, love. Anything we need? Righty-ho, tin of baked beans, half a pound of tuppenny rice and some of those knobbly Durex.’Presumably, it’s the flavoured variety they’ll be handing out with the Heinz 57.By way of full disclosure, I should tell you that one of the most lucrative night’s work I ever did was making an after-dinner speech to the annual sales conference of the London Rubber Company, getting on for 25 years ago. To be honest, I don’t enjoy after-dinner speaking, but they were paying eight grand and offering a chauffeur-driven Jag there and back, so it would have been rude not to.Frankly, the whole gig put me right off after-dinner speaking for life.

We sample them after lunch in the boardroom.’There’s no answer to that, as Eric Morecambe used to say. Sounds like the sort of work the BBC wine buff Jilly Goolden would have enjoyed. ‘I’m getting hints of saffron and smoked haddock.’ But I persevered.‘One thing that’s always puzzled me,’ I said. ‘All these flavours, pina colada, lager and lime, walnut whip, etc. Why don’t you do cheese and onion?’Without missing a beat, she gave me a quizzical look and said: ‘No call for it.’That was the moment when I knew the evening wasn’t going to end well.Start the car!Oh, and I’ve still got a souvenir of the evening, which they presented to me on the night, mounted on a wooden plinth.It’s a stainless steel cylinder they use to pass an electric current through the condoms to make sure they don’t leak.About 15 inches tall, and four inches in circumference, this fearsome projectile is obviously modelled on the device described in the old rugby song, An Engineer Told Me Before He Died. I defy any man to look at it without being overwhelmed by a shrivelling sense of gross inadequacy.Anyway, I digress. If I’d written a column back then predicting that one day the NHS would be giving away condoms at food banks to the over-60s, the editor would have called me into his office, probably summoning security at the same time.You’ve gone too far this time, Rich. How about a sabbatical? Or a drying-out clinic?But here we are in Austerity Britain, 2019, where the allegedly cash-starved NHS is giving free rubber johnnies to anyone eligible for a bus pass.Why Derbyshire, for a start, m’duck? Are they all at it like rabbits in the East Midlands? And why the over-60s, most of whom are probably thanking their lucky stars that they don’t have to use condoms any more?The official line is that, thanks to social media, the over-60s are having more casual sex than ever and, as a result, baby boomers are suffering from an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases.You can spot the walking frames leaning up against the rustling bushes in the park. Swipe left for a Nora Batty lookalike.Well, that’s their excuse and they’re sticking to it. They’ve even come up with a catchy slogan for the campaign.‘Jiggle, Wiggle.’What?Can you imagine the committee meeting called to discuss that?‘Ladies and gentlemen. We’re planning to give away rubber johnnies to old age pensioners, but we need a name for it. Any suggestions?’‘How about Jiggle, Wiggle?’‘Brilliant!’Jiggle, Wiggle?How old do they think we are — 65, or six?What will the NHS be giving away next — those inflatable dolls, from Only Fools And Horses?Still, it should do wonders for the bottom line of manufacturers like the London Rubber Company, or whatever it calls itself these days.Something for the weekend, sir? Help yourself, they’re free.Prior to this new injection of taxpayers’ cash from the NHS, the Aids scare in the Eighties was the best thing to have happened to the condom industry, after sales fell following the invention of The Pill.During the miners’ strike in 1984, one of my Evening Standard colleagues was billeted in a bed \u0026amp breakfast in Rotherham, or somewhere like that.On the first night, he found himself invited to share the bed of his landlady, a formidably enthusiastic woman of mature years — like Michael Caine’s landlady in Get Carter.When he was telling us the tale over a beer back in Fleet Street, someone said: ‘I do hope you practised safe sex.’‘No bother, there,’ he replied. ‘Couldn’t have been safer. She was far too old to have babies.’  Mad, bad and still dangerousAll you need to know about the diseased state of British politics is that Tom Watson, Labour’s Deputy Leader, is being talked up as a voice of moderation.In a world of deranged fanatics like O.J. Corbyn and Soubry Loo, two-bob spivs like Chucky Umunna, the hopeless Mother Theresa, and anti-democratic planks of wood like Spread Fear Phil and Dominique Grievance, I can see how Watson might appear to some as a sensible alternative.In common with Bonking Boris, he lost a bit of timber when he took up with a bird half his age. And he scrubs up quite well these days.But I didn’t dub him the Nonce Finder General for nothing. Watson is guilty of abusing parliamentary privilege to smear blameless Conservatives as child-molesters. Don’t forget, too, that he had his nose deep in the expenses scandal trough.The new model Turbo-Butter Tommy is also a sworn enemy of our Free Press, which he wants to hobble and bring under State control. Please don’t be fooled. Watson remains a very bad, mad and dangerous man, utterly unsuited for high office.If he’s one of life’s ‘moderates’ we must be in more trouble than we thought.  My colleague Ephraim Hardcastle reports that Elton John has ‘chosen’ pretty boy actor Taron Egerton, whoever he is, to play him in an upcoming movie.

However, one thing had remained the same – the belief that if we can help, even in a small way, what reason could we find for not doing it?\u0027   In 2017 Lenny resigned as a Comic Relief trustee after 27 years but has since been made an honorary life president of comic relief.  Victoria Beckham             Victoria Beckham, 44, posing in outfit worth £490, the t-shirt alone cost £90 from her own range In March 2018 Victoria made a controversial trip to the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, for Sports Relief along with her 9-person entourage. The 44-year-old fashion designer met school girls and gushed over a new born baby, named David, as he received life saving injections funded by USA Red Nose Day donations. Victoria faced a media backlash while on the trip for wearing an outfit which cost £490 around the Nairobi slums.The same week Liz Warner, chief executive of Comic Relief, which runs Sport Relief and Red Nose Day, announced that celebrities would take a back seat for on-location appeals following complaints about \u0027poverty tourism\u0027. In a press release about the trip Victoria said: \u0027I\u0027m so proud to have been supporting the amazing work of Sport Relief for over a decade.\u0027I first went on a field trip to Peru in 2004 for the \u0027A mile in their shoes\u0027 documentary. 14 years later, here I am in Kenya, visiting incredible community projects that are protecting, educating and empowering women of all ages.\u0027            Victoria sports a red nose while visiting a school in Nairobi, kenya, along with film crew   Reggie Yates            Reggie Yates, 35-year-old TV presenterIn 2017 Reggie took part in the African convoy through Africa delivering bikes to workers. In Kenya he spoke to a women named Olivia who was living a hand to mouth existence and struggling to afford food for her children. Her children washed behind the house in a puddle of water mixed with sewage.After Reggie\u0027s visit, two of Olivia\u0027s daughters (Faith and Felister) were enrolled into education, receiving counselling, life skills training and remedial education.The Comic Relief-funded project support Olivia to join a savings group, so that she can start a small business, which could give her children a more secure future.Reggie also accompanied Lennie Henry to Kiberia, Kenya, in 2011, living among open sewers for a week.Writing in The Guardian about the experience he said: \u0027Lenny Henry, Angela Rippon, Samantha Womack and I spent a week in Nairobi.\u0027I had some drinking water and the occasional sweet or chocolate bar, but I was living among open sewers, sleeping in shacks. I pretty much lost all appetite, for days on end.\u0027   One DirectionIn 2013 the One Direction boys Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik visited Accra, Ghana.The men were so affected by the children and young babies they met, most fighting for their lives against common diseases like diarrhoea and pneumonia at the children\u0027s hospital in Accra, that they broke down while filming, pleading with viewers to give generously.Harry Styles cried after meeting a three-year-old boy suffering from malaria and anaemia.            Harry Styles and Liam Payne talking to children in Accra, Ghana Zayn Malik also broke down in tears, admitting he was struggling to come to terms with the magnitude of seeing children fighting for their lives on a daily basis. He said: \u0027It\u0027s so hard. I\u0027ve never seen anything, never experienced anything like this in my life. The babies aren\u0027t even a year old.\u0027Begging viewers to donate to this year\u0027s Red Nose Day Appeal, he added: \u0027We all waste money but the most important thing we can all do is give £5 to protect children from these illnesses.\u0027        Samantha Womack, who played Ronnie Mitchell in EastEndersDuring the 2011 \u0027Rich, Famous and in the Slums\u0027 visit to Kiberia, Kenya, Samantha Womack, who played Ronnie Mitchell in EastEnders, went to live in the house of a woman who had been forced to resort to prostitution.The woman had had no choice but to send her children away to their grandmother while she earnt money and her family weren\u0027t aware she was a prostitute.The actress also spent time at a clinic and was reduced to tears while comforting a woman who had given birth to a stillborn baby. Samantha told Whatsontv: \u0027I wasn\u0027t prepared for the impact Kibera would have on me, it\u0027s a tragically beautiful place. I\u0027ve never felt part of a community like that before, I feel privileged that I got to meet the people I met.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Iceland marks 30 years country ended 74 year ban beer","story":"    Icelanders will be hitting bars and pubs across the nation today to celebrate 30 years since the country ended its 74-year ban on beer          All alcohol was banned under prohibition laws in 1915, which were repealed in 1933. But beer stayed illegal until March 1, 1989, as the country tried to appease the temperance movement. Pictured: Icelanders celebrating the end of the ban on March 2, 1989 Prohibition was then repealed in another national referendum in 1933.

Australian student reveals how she took a picture...Share this articleWith alcoholism still widespread, most Icelanders favor strict government restrictions on alcohol sales. Apart from the country\u0027s bars, alcohol - beer included - is only sold at government-run monopoly stores, with limited opening hours and high taxes.A pint of beer costs about 1,100 krona ($9, £6.95) in bars, while a bottle of Smirnoff vodka costs the equivalent of $67 (£51) in the stores that sell it.A thirst for change began in the 1970s when Icelanders increasingly started vacationing in sunny European beach resorts and developed a taste for a cooling beer.          Apart from the country\u0027s bars, alcohol - beer included - is only sold at government-run monopoly stores, with limited opening hours and high taxesBack home, local bartenders responded by inventing the \u0027bjorliki\u0027 cocktail, a pseudo-beer made by blending non-alcoholic pilsner with aquavit - in very variable ratios.Yet a large part of the population still opposed lifting the beer ban when parliament debated the issue for the last time in 1988.Steingrimur Sigfusson, who is parliamentary speaker today, at the time painted a gloomy picture of the chaos that would result as \u0027hundreds of taverns\u0027 opened up to crowds with no experience of the beverage. He voted against the proposition.He still defends the country\u0027s restrictive alcohol policy that aims to limit binge and teen drinking.\u0027The worst-case predictions never came true but underage drinking did increase,\u0027 Sigfusson said.The ban finally ended on a Wednesday. All four bars in Reykjavik were jam packed with drinkers toasting their new-found freedom while the country\u0027s population of 260,000 celebrated by buying more than 340,000 cans of beer at overcrowded Vinbudin monopoly stores.\u0027I wasn\u0027t sure what to make of this day - we knew so little about beer,\u0027 said Sigurdur Snorrason, founder of the RVK brewing company, at a craft beer festival in the capital Reykjavik celebrating the milestone anniversary.Hreindis Ylva was born the day the ban was lifted.

Of the 493, I’ve typically heard of two. Which raises questions. 1) Am I an ignoramus? 2) Does every author read faster than I do? My list is two-and-a-half books long. First, Masha Gessen’s The Man Without a Face, about Putin. Second, Martin Amis’s essay collection The Rub of Time. Last, Daniel Deronda by George Eliot, for which I’m crediting myself only a half-book, since I’ve been in a troubled relationship with it for a year. We keep getting back together. I know it won’t work. But I can’t end it.The book that changed my lifeWhile I was studying cinema at university, Elie Wiesel published a memoir, All Rivers Run to the Sea, about surviving the Nazi death camps and his subsequent blossoming as a reporter and novelist. I was so moved, underlining passages throughout. My dreams of film-making receded I wanted to try writing. Years later, I met Wiesel briefly, and discovered how hard it is to convey to a stranger what he has meant to you.The book that had the greatest influence on meAny collection of George Orwell’s essays that includes Politics and the English Language and Why I Write. The first essay taught me how to identify blather, and that clarity is a form of courage. The second – with its confession to the petty motives behind writing alongside the noble ones – encouraged me to be frank, even if facing scorn for it.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readBooks are a poor cause for shame when there are so many better places to apply it. Still, I panicked before one of my first public readings, fearing that the audience might spontaneously quiz me on great works I’d never read. This nightmare never materialised because an audience hardly materialised, just one rickety couple in the last row, she stage-whispering: “Walter, wake up – the young man’s talking!” I’m less frantic about my literary gaps now. In a lifetime, one has only so many books, which is good reason to never feel shame at quitting them when deserving multitudes still await.The book I think is most underratedAn entire form as underrated: the short story. So few prominent publications bother with them anymore, though they seem ideally suited to our diminished attention s. I dream of starting a free culture newspaper, handed out at train stations, and including one topical short story per edition. Billionaires who don’t mind losing their entire investment should get in touch.The book that changed my mindMy adulthood started in the 1990s, when the west was still pleased with itself. Free-market ideals appeared both triumphant and moral. Unthinkingly, I shared these assumptions. Tony Judt’s Ill Fares the Land showed how shallow I’d been. Our vanity was underpinned by vice – self-interest, above all. This has aged into real ugliness. Sadly, Judt didn’t age with us, dying in 2010, the year this book came out. I wish he were here to explain 2019.The last book that made me cryCurious George and the Firefighters by Margret and HA Rey. I love reading to my son, but some books challenge parental devotion. As if the 41,938th reading wasn’t enough to bring me to tears, he inadvertently poked it in my eye.The book I couldn’t finishI once read an interview with Gabriel García Márquez in which he declared himself too old to keep finishing books that he didn’t like. His admission became my permission, and I started stopping. If you want names, here are just a few of the reportedly great books I’ve broken up with: Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, Underworld by Don DeLillo, Gravity’s Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon.My earliest reading memoryMy first memory of reading is of not reading. Everyone in my family devoured books. I, the youngest, felt like a dunce. In foggy memory, I recall a copy of James and the Giant Peach. And Dickens on tape, although you might not count that reading. Only in my mid-teens did I discover the bliss of books, and haven’t stopped since.The book I give as a giftI should buy Orwell’s essays in bulk I’m always giving them away.

Television presenter Holly Willoughby recently reposted a 2017 picture of her and Spice Girl Emma Bunton wearing the T-shirts. has established that the garments were made by Bangladeshi firm Dird Composite Textiles, where some workers earn as little as 42p an hour and complain of harassment. In one case, a female employee was beaten on the orders of the management and threatened with murder.After being contacted by the , F stopped selling the T-shirts and Worldreader pledged to cease accepting donations “until the situation is resolved”.Machinists at the factory say they have been sacked en masse after striking over wages in January. They are among more than 7,500 employees at 27 factories in Bangladesh who have lost their jobs in recent weeks, according to union leaders, amid widespread protests and strike action over the imposition of a new minimum wage – which critics argue is too low – for the country’s garment industry.The new minimum wage for the sector is 8,000 taka (£71.34) a month, half what the 16,000 campaigners had been demanding and well short of living wage estimates. Meanwhile, some higher-grade factory workers who already earned more than 8,000 taka a month received only small increases, it is claimed.Kalpona Akter, executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity, who worked as a child labourer in textile factories, said: “The huge number of dismissals over wage protests shows how workers’ voices have been suppressed and how they are lacking freedom of expression.“The workers that got fired know the law and their rights. In many cases they were union leaders in their respective factories. These workers are picked intentionally so there is no voice left in a factory to fight against retaliation and form a union.”Dird insists that the workers who left resigned of their own volition.The Fair Wear Foundation (FWF), a membership organisation paid by brands to improve working conditions, is investigating after a complaint was received about the workers’ plight at Dird’s factory.The news comes after the  revealed last month that an “outspoken” worker at the same factory claimed she was beaten up on the orders of management and threatened with murder.The woman, who sat on the factory’s anti-harassment committee, said she was robbed of her severance pay and told that if she protested she would be “killed and her body put in a cardboard box”, according to an FWF report.The factory initially denied the allegations, but later sacked the HR manager and paid the woman 68,250 taka in compensation after pressure from FWF.A separate  investigation last month revealed how Spice Girls T-shirts sold to raise money for Comic Relief were made by Bangladeshi women at a different factory earning 35p an hour, who claimed they suffered harassment and were forced to work up to 16 hours a day.After Willoughby reposted the picture of her and Bunton wearing the “girl power” T-shirts recently, the Twitter feed of F shared the picture and said the items were in “huge demand”.Representatives for Willoughby and Bunton declined to comment, but it is understood neither was paid to wear the garments or post them on social media.F’s website claims that they are “made in a Fair Wear Foundation certified factory, which means it is vetted for good working conditions and fair wages and by using organic cotton we drastically reduce the use of water”.The shirts are made by StanleyStella, the same Belgian brand that made the Spice Girls T-shirts.  has established, via a code printed on the label, that the garments were made at Dird Composite’s factory in Bangladesh.An FWF spokeswoman said: “Over 100 workers claim to have lost their jobs. We did indeed meet with the factory and StanleyStella. There were some discrepancies between what we heard from the factory management and the complainants’ stories and their personal files.“The factory is in the process of paying legal entitlements, such as due salaries, provident fund and severance pay to all the workers concerned. FWF and StanleyStella will keep a close eye on this.”Danielle Newnham, who founded F with her sister, said: “We have asked StanleyStella about these reported resignations – they have explained that this only happened recently and is being investigated by the Fair Wear Foundation and StanleyStella’s country manager in Dhaka.“To clarify, we print our T-shirts here in the UK, but we are always concerned if anyone is treated badly – our entire mission is based on empowerment and if we receive evidence of poor treatment, we would look for another supplier immediately.“All the research we have done in the past showed StanleyStella to be one of the best manufacturers both in terms of sustainability and working conditions they urge their suppliers to uphold, hence we used them. However, we are wholly dedicated to empowerment and have therefore closed our entire shop whilst any issues are being looked into.”A Worldreader spokesman said: “Worldreader was saddened to hear about the conditions in the factory where these shirts were produced. Prior to accepting donations from the sales of ‘Girl Power’ T-shirts, we entered into a contract that ensured the shirts were ‘Fair Wear certified’. Worldreader has agreed with F that we will cease accepting donations from the sale of these shirts until the situation is resolved.”Dird’s group managing director, Nabeel Ud Daulah, said that the company operated “with the highest regard for ethical and moral standards” and denied any suppression or targeting of worker representatives. He said that the staff who left resigned “because they were not satisfied with the new wage structure that was announced by the Bangladesh government” and that “all workers that resigned have either received their due financial entitlements or have been contacted to collect their due entitlements”.Pointing to benefits provided to workers, including scholarships for their children, insurances and bonuses, he added: “We take such allegations extremely seriously and have provided full disclosure and cooperation to Fair Wear Foundation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d46d4551fc86a41133aa1317d7a79c8decddfd10/589_209_4461_2677/master/4461.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=9d3f6cc901920af8b9dc0682d11edb0e","title":"forget tango the murga of buenos aires is a riot of sequins and salvation","story":"Freelance photographer Kate Stanworth has been following a Buenos Aires murga group for 10 years, as they perform in an energetic street carnival that is little known beyond ArgentinaArgentina’s charismatic capital, Buenos Aires, might be more famous for tango, steak and football than colourful carnival parades. However, murga – a feisty, home-grown form of street dance and percussion performed during carnival season, once unfairly thought of as only performed by drop-outs and drunks – has flourished in recent years, providing a source of pride, happiness and salvation for the predominantly working class families that dedicate their lives to it.One of the capital’s approximately 100 official groups, La Locura de Boedo (the craziness of Boedo), invited me to tour the city with them 10 years ago while working on a newspaper assignment. I have been following their fortunes through carnival seasons ever since, travelling with the troupe on beaten up school buses to parades in far flung barrios across the city – unpretentious affairs in which street corners house makeshift scaffold stages.The carnival takes place during the humid summer months when the city’s well-off residents tend to relocate to the coast. Local children, many of whom can’t afford holidays away, peer transfixed through railings, in search of a different kind of escape, as their local idols fling their arms around and dance in a rapturous series of acrobatic kicks, to the hypnotic, thunderous beat of bass drums and cymbals.Like Rio’s Samba, Salvador’s Axe and Andean Carnavalito, murga’s roots reflect the cultural melting pot of Argentina’s colonial past, nodding back to the shores of Europe and Africa. The art form was repressed during the dictatorship of 1976-83, but went on to flourish during the 1990s among predominantly working class families, with the number of groups increasing more than tenfold.Over time I learned that behind the spectacle of the parades, murga is a powerful social force shaping people’s identities and providing a support network rooted in the local neighbourhood. It gives people a sense of pride, an outlet for collective creativity and an escape from everyday struggles.“Through the murga you give a hand to whoever needs it,” says Juanjo, the charismatic director who runs the troupe with his wife Monica and their two sons, Maxi and Jony. “You try to contain the kids on the street, get them out of drugs and put them within this circle, which is the most beautiful thing there is.”In the lead up to carnival, Juanjo and Monica’s humble grey-cement house is a hive of activity, as murgueros of all ages gather to put the finishing touches to brightly coloured satin suits, put on shimmering make up in their group colours of red, white and turquoise, and assemble the distinctive bass drums with brass cymbals on top that anchor the murga’s percussion.During weekdays, the troupe are taxi drivers, receptionists, pest controllers, teachers, cleaners, plumbers and students, many struggling under the weight of Argentina’s worsening economic situation, which has recently seen a dramatic currency devaluation and soaring food and utility prices.But on Saturday and Sunday nights they leave their troubles behind and transform into glittering performers, with coat tails weighed down by appliques made of thousands of beads they have painstakingly sewn by hand over months.Juanjo, Monica, Maxi and Jony’s decision to dedicate themselves to murga came in an attempt to take their minds off their sadness after Juanjo and Monica’s youngest son died of meningitis in 1995 at the age of two. Now the group feels like a giant family. The directors are looked at by many in the 200-strong group as parental figures. “The role that my father left, he (Juanjo) took on,” says dancer Makiú.Like many group members, Makiú met her partner through murga, and the couple made their three children tiny suits for carnival not long after they were born, carrying them through the parade in their arms until they were old enough to dance and play the drums.Murga still bears the scars of historical marginalisation, with many in Argentine society continuing to associate it with transgression and delinquency. However, in 1997, the activity of murga groups was given ‘“cultural heritage” status by the City of Buenos Aires, and in 2011 former president Cristina de Kirchner re-instated the two-day carnival public holiday that had been taken away during the dictatorship, supporting murga’s transition into a family friendly, more mainstream activity.Despite this, there are few adverts for the carnival in the local media, so the parades remain largely undiscovered by tourists and even many city residents. For those that come to watch and take part in it, however, murga has long been an empowering force against the mixed fortunes of their everyday lives.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e122806002dab57c0e73b68ac53cfbe355f26b69/42_0_4827_2896/master/4827.jpg?width=4750\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36af748f4ec63bee98f1e14cc1e98409 4750w","title":"britain learning languages brexit  education","story":"Brexit looming, we must wake up to the huge educational, cultural and psychological benefits of multilingualismNational myths play a central role in the story of a country, and the UK is no exception. Over the centuries, we Britons have come to believe that we are naturally proficient – exceptional, even – in certain pursuits. These include engineering, literature, the classics, pop music, geography and football. As the country that gave the world Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the Beatles, and the beautiful game, perhaps we have a point. To be British, we understand, is to excel in these areas, and this tacit understanding powers us on to ever greater achievements.But it is instructive, when thinking about the UK and Britishness and what might lie in store for us in the future, to consider the pursuits about which we do not feel so confident. Of these, by far the most significant – and the most worrying – is other languages.At some point in our history, we seem to have accepted the idea that we do not need to learn languages and that we are not very good at them anyway. This is curious, given that we are an island nation that needs to trade to survive.This simply cannot go on. With Brexit just around the corner, it is critical we start to value languages and wake up to the enormous advantages multilingualism can bring.Languages are also vital to national security, diplomacy and soft power. At the reopening of the Foreign Office’s language centre in September 2013, the then foreign secretary, William Hague, said: “The ability to speak, read, listen and write in a foreign language is one of the fundamental skills of our diplomats. Without it, they cannot get under the skin of a country and really understand its people.” These skills will prove vital to post-Brexit Britain, as we look to forge new relationships across the globe and strengthen ties within Europe.But the benefits of language learning extend well beyond simply being able to communicate with our global neighbours. Research shows that language learning at school boosts overall literacy, which is a major predictor of children’s attainment in science and maths. We know too that the ability to switch between languages develops cognitive flexibility and improves multitasking and creativity.But there are signs that this is changing. Duolingo, a hugely popular free language-learning app, claims to have millions of UK users who practise a range of languages, from Spanish and French to Japanese, Chinese and Russian. The UK has the potential to become a linguistic powerhouse and with the right policies, political will and cross-sector support, we can create hundreds of thousands of linguists – and transform the UK into a more prosperous, productive, influential nation. Embracing multilingualism would enrich us culturally and economically, improve social cohesion and enhance our wellbeing.Languages can no longer be regarded as an optional extra. Britain must meet this challenge head-on and prove to the world that it is, after all, an outward-looking, global nation.• David Cannadine is president of the British Academy which, with the backing of all the national academies, is calling on the government to implement a national strategy for languages"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42c144c8b77cf79be5c4d0e1e4154ae1dbd96dd/0_425_6735_4042/master/6735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d25c50affc0c929a3fbfade1d1613d6","title":"remain second referendum open britain peoples vote","story":"A campaign led by Open Britain stalwarts such as Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell would probably lose a people’s voteThere is only a “least bad time” for raising the question of who should lead a movement you are backing to the hilt. My movement is the People’s Vote campaign for a referendum on Theresa May’s deal. Should it be called, we will face the question of who will be the designated organisation, receiving the lion’s share of funding. On balance I think it is best to pose this question now.I’m still afraid that May’s deal will pass, with some tweaks to the backstop. But the welcome turn in Labour’s approach, plus the fragmentation of the political parties, means that the Commons could decide that May’s deal must be ratified by the voters. In which case, the People’s Vote becomes a reality and staying in the EU a genuine possibility.So who should frame the remain agenda of a second campaign?In the 2016 referendum, Vote Leave was designated as the lead organisation for Brexit and defined the argument around Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and their deceitful battle bus and compelling slogan, take back control. The designated remain campaign was Britain Stronger in Europe, headed by David Cameron and overseen outside Downing Street by Peter Mandelson. It blocked positive arguments for EU membership and pushed a lacklustre Project Fear.Today, Britain Stronger in Europe has changed its name to Open Britain and plays a controlling role in the People’s Vote campaign. The campaign’s communication strategy, headed by Tom Baldwin, who worked for Ed Miliband, has been brilliant. Baldwin set out to inspire an “insurgency” against Brexit. He backed younger activists with their own organisations. They have transformed opposition to Brexit into a popular cause.But pro-Europeans have to be coldly realistic. Open Britain is chaired by the super-rich Roland Rudd, with Alastair Campbell and Mandelson as key players. It platforms Tony Blair. Not only is it preposterous for them to claim to lead an insurgency, the likelihood is that they would lose a second referendum. I don’t say this in a spirit of sectarianism what matters are policies, not personalities. One of the advantages the Brexiteers had in 2016 was that different organisations campaigned for it. The public responded to their shared passion, not their disagreements. Arguments over substance can build a cause.And a new referendum will hinge on an issue of principle. Are the anti-Brexit side attempting to reverse the verdict of 2016 and revert to the status quo of the Cameron years? Or are we agreeing that there is a huge democratic problem with the way the elite have governed Britain, but that leaving the EU will make this worse not better?The latter embraces the justified heart of the Brexit protest and seeks to build on its democratic, anti-elite energy. It is the only way to win and, just as important, because it reaches out to leave voters, can generate the positive energy to create a new consensus afterwards. Those who sustained the old order for so long and have never resiled from it cannot convincingly promise such change.If they lead the pro-EU side in a new referendum, we will be destroyed. A well-funded alliance will deploy its expertise and, boy, will they throw in everything they can, and more, to secure Brexit.Their key skill is in the dark arts of voter suppression. Paul Hilder has set out an authoritative analysis of how it works. Voter suppression uses psychographic algorithms to identify key segments of the population. They are then forensically targeted with quick videos showing, for example, Blair on the People’s Vote platform and then on a ski ride in Davos, calling for a new referendum – with his net worth as the subtitle. The message: that the referendum is a rip-off and “they are all the same”. Market testing reveals what images and phrases “work”. The aim is not to convert, but to disillusion and thereby turn young voters especially into abstainers.A strong rebuttal of such foul and cynical methods has a chance of defeating them. But if the images used include Mandelson on a yacht with George Osborne and the notorious Russian aluminium oligarch Oleg Deripaska, not to speak of Blair, and they are at the helm of the campaign to remain, such charges will have the sting of truth.Of course, everyone must be given the opportunity to redeem themselves. At this crucial moment, the best way that current controllers of the People’s Vote can do so is to step aside.They will, anyway, be anathema to the Labour leaders on whom any popular vote now depends, since they have called for one. The point of principle, however, is that if we get the referendum the country deserves, we remainers cannot afford to recycle 2016 and win it narrowly on a negative platform with transactional definition of who we are as a people.Instead we need the designated campaign to be inspired by democracy and led by the new generation. For beyond the familiar faces, new and often female leaders are emerging with the creative energy to set out a European path that backs free movement, governs migration, welcomes good regulation and secures our liberties and freedom. The direction of the pro-European side in any new referendum is therefore an issue that will have to be confronted. It is best to do so now and have it in the open. A new approach that takes on board the bold anti-establishment impulse of Brexit could also reassure hesitant MPs in leave seats. For it gives them an honourable, democratic message for their constituents, that builds on Brexit’s demand for change and thereby lays to rest the prime minister’s absurd claim that another vote means “breaking faith” with the first.• Anthony Barnett is co-founder of openDemocracy and author of The Lure of Greatness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ffe2c1ee7917785859a1b9348a9e79356d7b6a7/0_0_5123_3074/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=450e43268a0a9510c5e723352d39ac5f","title":"shamima begum muslim women targets","story":"The Isis recruit perfectly embodies the terrorist-victim stereotype that our society still perpetuatesSpoiler alert: the Muslim woman at the heart of the story starts out as the groomed victim of a brutal jihadi husband, but by the end of the season her character is unmasked as the violent terrorist.Actually, no spoiler alert is needed because these are exactly the stereotypes constantly perpetuated about Muslim women in daily life.It’s probably one of the reasons the Shamima Begum case is having such a profound impact one dimensional stereotypes about Muslim women already run so deep. Begum embodies this exact victim-terrorist paradox. While the former Bethnal Green schoolgirl did join Isis, we don’t know whether she committed crimes while in Syria, and none of us will unless she is brought to justice.But the binary way in which her story has been framed – she is either a dangerous public enemy and security risk covered from head to toe in her long black clothing, audaciously demanding to be taken back to Britain, or she is a helpless victim, tricked into marriage to a man twice her age, rape, three pregnancies, the loss of two babies, post-natal depression and war trauma – is unhelpful. It ignores the fact that sometimes the truth is complex and lies somewhere between the extremes, and that is having an impact on other Muslim women in Britain.There are already reports of abuse and hatred against Muslim women as a result of her case. It emerged this week that a shooting range in Merseyside has been using images of Begum as target practice. Children as young as six are welcomed at this range and presumably even they will be allowed to fire bullets at a target of Begum’s face. It’s as though there is an unspoken glee in suddenly being able to revel in openly demonising a Muslim woman with impunity. A reinterpretation of the Salem witch trials for a modern era might look like this. I should repeat at this point - for those who will double down on their stereotypes of Muslim women by accusing me of being a terrorist apologist - that she should face justice, but she needs to be investigated rather than tried in advance by assumptions as those witches once were.On our streets, on our front pages and across much of our media, in the mouths of our politicians, at the dinner table and in even the most genteel of establishments the stereotypes of Muslim women over the last decade persist, in fact I’d say have become often more entrenched. They include being at once both victim and terrorist, oppressed, ‘traditionally submissive’, unable to speak English, brainwashed, waiting to be saved by feminists among others, lacking in agency (but also at the same time blamed for bringing up young jihadis).Sometimes well-meaning people feed the stereotypes with platitudes: (don’t worry, I see past your headscarf). Others take away our agency (did your father make you marry him?) while some simply see us as walking bombs and demand we obey their patriarchal demands (answer my questions, and if you don’t then you must be a jihadi). These stereotypes are incredibly resistant to change.Ten years ago I wrote a book Love in a Headscarf which set out to challenge stereotypes by telling my own story. It was described in the  as hovering “somewhere between chick-lit and memoir”. As I explained in these pages in 2009 it was an expression of how I was “fed up with reading stories in the papers about how all Muslim women are oppressed”.It was one of the first books that explored the idea of a Muslim woman confident but questioning of her faith, trying to find a place in a world . But 10 years on it feels like the book could be written today and would still run up against the same stereotypical thinking.True, a new cohort of Muslim women have grown up in that time. Some have entered and started to make an impact on politics such as the eight female Muslim MPs currently serving in the House of Commons, and more senior leaders in the House of Lords such as Sayeeda Warsi, Meral Ece-Hussain and Nosheena Mobarik.Our public figures have changed too, with Mishal Husain as one of the voices we now wake up to on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and Fatima Manji on Channel 4 news. Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain brings joy (and great food) to homes around the country, and is confident and proud in describing herself as British, Bangladeshi and Muslim.This month has seen publication of It’s Not About the Burqa, an anthology of stories edited by Mariam Khan and written by Muslim women. It follows in the footsteps of The Things I Would Tell You: British Muslim Women Write published in 2017. These would have been unthinkable when my book came out, and I hope I helped to lay the foundation for such writing.Social media has also given a platform to young Muslim women some of whom reach millions of people, proving the point that their stories are of interest and value.So while there is much to be glad about but even if it is easier in relative terms for Muslim women to have their voices heard now, the responses are more likely to be aggressive and even violent.The conversation about women has moved forward dramatically with movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp. Yet the conversation about Muslim women continues to be stuck in a groundhog day of veils, burkinis and jihadi brides. Suspicion and dehumanisation are rarely far from the surface.Islamophobia is real, and gendered Islamophobia even more so, layering anti-Muslim hatred and misogyny together often with an unhealthy dollop of racism. No matter how hard and how constantly we challenge the hostility, discrimination, misrepresentation and abuse we face day in and day out, being fed those stereotypes from all sides means they have a huge impact. It’s harder for Muslim women to get jobs. Verbal abuse and physical assault are on the rise. All of us should be deeply alarmed.What brings joy to my heart is that Muslim women are increasingly vocal about their rights, that their place in this society is theirs by right and they are no longer willing to accept a meek head-down toleration.But we need to keep destroying the stereotypes and recognise that there is a systemic problem, whose roots sink deep. And until we weed the whole thing out – instead of watering it as some of our public figures keep doing – we will not create the kind of definitive transformation that we are trying to achieve. This means that politicians and policy makers must face up to the open and also subtle hatreds but they must also institute structural changes which will have enduring effects.It means that across the media, arts and culturethose who have power over what we view and read, from journalists to tastemakers need to take a long hard look at who is producing their content and ensuring Muslim voices are represented. But it requires that everyone recognises how negative stereotypes of Muslim women have become entrenched and normalised and how prevalent verbal and physical hostility is and to intervene against it.Only by taking such difficult steps will we all be able to look back in 10 years’ time and think: this time we really did make the change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2e37eec712d33e3a3ead0db509fb7cdcaacc37f/0_182_3280_1968/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3126c4ea78c466b3aba0900e9429358","title":"uk national offer day secondary school what are your experiences","story":"As local authorities announce places on 1 March we would like to hear how parents are feelingFamilies across England and Wales are waiting to hear if their children have got a place at the secondary school of their choice on national offer day.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez might have hit on a more devastating attackIt’s a fantastic time for verbal abuse in American politics. Donald Trump loves a schoolyard nickname, insulting everyone from “Crazy Bernie” Sanders to “Little Marco” Rubio. In turn, the president’s opponents, and sometimes his allies, have called him a moron, a motherfucker and mocked his tiny hands.But is there a way of using name-calling, not just to insult, but to introduce a new political idea. It seemed like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was doing that this week when she used the term “climate delayer” to call out those dragging their feet on climate change.Ocasio-Cortez used the term to describe Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was filmed telling a bunch of children that when it comes to the looming apocalypse, she knows better than they do, because she has spent a long time in the Senate not fixing the problem. While they called for immediate action on the Green New Deal, she argued that change wasn’t going to come anytime soon. After all, when it comes to averting a global catastrophe on an unprecedented scale, endangering hundreds of millions and fundamentally altering the human experience, you don’t want to rush into things.The clip went viral. In the ensuing days, Ocasio-Cortez warned on Instagram and Twitter of the threat of “climate delayers”: people who appear to accept that something needs to be done about climate change, but don’t seem to grasp its urgency. These people, she pointed out, aren’t much better than people who deny climate change exists.The term isn’t entirely new. “Global warming delayer” appeared on sites like ThinkProgress more than a decade ago it appeared in the  at least as far back as 2011. And out of context, it sounds like a badge of honor. A climate denier denies climate change, so a climate delayer … delays it? Like by buying a Prius?But that’s getting into the weeds: we should celebrate the phrase’s emergencein mainstream political debate. Trump’s political success has proven that a label can be as effective a thousand nuanced arguments. Sure, “Delayin’ Feinstein” might not have quite the same ring as “Lyin’ Ted”, but it’s getting there. And given the scale of the issue, we badly need an arsenal of labels for people standing in the way of climate progress.Labels for people who reject the scientific evidence of climate change have a tortured history. A debate has raged as to whether “climate denier” or “climate skeptic” should be used to describe such people, the latter term aiming to soothe the egos of officials who just aren’t quite sure they can believe basically every scientist.Scientists who consider themselves genuine skeptics – in the sense of seeking “scientific inquiry, critical investigation and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims” – didn’t like the term “skeptics” for people who rejected expertise they wanted to call them deniers, according to the Associated Press, purveyors of one of journalism’s leading style guides.But those “deniers”, understandably, didn’t like the language’s resemblance to Holocaust denial. So in 2015, the AP put forward another option, “climate doubters”, advising writers to ditch “deniers” and “skeptics” entirely.’s own style guide takes a different view: “The OED defines a sceptic as ‘a seeker of the truth an inquirer who has not yet arrived at definite conclusions’. Most so-called ‘climate change sceptics’, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, deny that climate change is happening, or is caused by human activity, so denier is a more accurate term.”On top of all that, there are “climate contrarians”, who make it their business to fight the scientific consensus – “often with substantial financial support from fossil fuels industry organizations and conservative thinktanks,” as summarized in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.And yet none of these labels have managed to target a fundamental obstacle to climate change action: powerful people who profess to understand climate change, yet are curiously immobile on the issue. Perhaps the popularization of “delayer” will finally put the pressure on. When it comes to politically productive name-calling, it’s a lot snappier to dismiss someone as a “climate delayer” than to chastise them as a “person who apparently believes the science but is unwilling to acknowledge the urgency of the situation”.It’s worth noting in all this that the very phrase “climate change” is mired in labelling warfare. As anyone who has seen the movie Vice knows, the Republican pollster Frank Luntz encouraged the George W Bush administration to use the phrase “climate change” rather than “global warming”. Yale researchers recount a secret memo in which he pointed out that a focus group participant felt “climate change ‘sounds like you’re going from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale’,” whereas “global warming has catastrophic connotations”. Perhaps if we’d all stuck with “global warming” – or even tried “global heating” – concern would have grown faster.Luntz knows messaging: he turned the estate tax into the “death tax” and health reform into a “government takeover” of healthcare. Fortunately in Ocasio-Cortez, it seems the left has a messaging expert of its own. And whether denier or delayer, she points out, “if they get their way, we’re toast”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd94ef7b4ac39661eb155dc2d50957f700978fd/0_188_5124_3074/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3188106e7e7f2c6085e70fa459b6f4c","title":"country diary flicker of turquoise morphs into a kingfisher langstone hampshire","story":"Langstone, Hampshire: As it turns to face me, its burnished copper breast-feathers glow in the late afternoon sunBefore it reaches Southmoor Meadow coastal grazing marsh, a nature reserve and site of special scientific interest, the Langbrook stream passes through Havant, flowing past a supermarket and several fast food outlets. As I walk into town, I’m unsurprised to find the bank strewn with sandwich and burger packaging, while midstream the resident moorhen pair pick their way across a weed-tangled raft of discarded soft drink bottles, crisp packets and chocolate bar wrappers.Up ahead, a flicker of turquoise blue catches my eye. At first glance I assume it is a piece of wind-blown litter snagged on a twig, but as I draw closer the smudge of colour morphs into a kingfisher (Alcedo atthis). Sensing my approach, it turns to face me, its burnished copper breast-feathers glowing in the late afternoon sun.Kingfishers are a fairly common sight in the harbour throughout the winter. At this time of year these sparrow-sized birds need to consume their own body weight in fish every day. They are resident in much of their range, but they often move from inland rivers and lakes to the coast in search of food. In Germany they are called Eisvogel – or ice bird – perhaps alluding to this migratory behaviour, though there may be a more macabre origin to the name: on the continent kingfishers have been found entombed in ice on frozen ponds and canals, perfectly preserved, with their wings tucked into ing position.I’m surprised to see this female – identifiable by her orangey-red lower mandible – hunting so far upstream. Parish records indicate that eels, brown trout, sticklebacks, freshwater shrimps and miller’s thumb (European bullhead, Cottus gobio) were once abundant in this shallow, slow-moving watercourse, but I pass this section of the stream several times a week and on just one occasion have I caught sight of a shoal of small, silvery fish – possibly minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) – schooling in the shadow of the A27 underpass.I watch as the kingfisher’s beady black eyes scan for prey. The usually clear water is clouded brown with sediment and urban runoff, and there is no sign of the tell-tale circular ripples of fish rising to the surface, but the mere presence of this jewel of a bird is a glimmer of hope in this unpromising suburban landscape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e1fa4ee4ef1923b020e354d76059b3fd8bb3efe/0_2395_4032_2418/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b49098bd8628c0d5f270484887b5c368","title":"how to work the spring green look in pictures","story":"Emerald, lime and mint are all good to go this season: wear head to toe or pick an accent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Yet, because it’s working class, it’s marginalised, writes director Stephen MerchantIn 2014, after years of struggle, a working-class British woman, aged just 21, was awarded the highest honour her profession can bestow, live, in front of 20,000 people and a television audience of millions. didn’t report it. In the days following, there were no laudatory profiles, no in-depth interviews, no op-eds about her stratospheric success in a male-dominated world.Saraya-Jade Bevis, known professionally as Paige, is a World Wrestling Entertainment superstar. She began her career wrestling with her family in small venues across Norfolk, before climbing to the top of WWE, the billion-dollar US sports entertainment empire, to become the youngest ever “Divas champion”, the wrestling equivalent of heavyweight champion of the world.I like to think I’m culturally aware, but I had never heard of Paige. And I don’t blame the , or the other broadsheets they have no duty to report on any entertainer (professional wrestling is as much performance as sport). Nevertheless, it is interesting to compare the attention Paige received with that conferred on other British performers.In the past 18 months, Claire Foy and Olivia Colman have deservedly won major awards for their brilliant portrayals of English queens. Both wins came with lengthy interviews and profile pieces in the quality newspapers, plus countless mentions on BBC TV and radio.I have worked with both these actors and they deserve every plaudit and column inch that comes their way. But acting, like pro wrestling, is another branch of show business. Foy and Colman have been rightly celebrated for cracking the US and conquering Hollywood, so why not Paige, who cracked America and conquered WWE (the Hollywood of wrestling) three years earlier?Over the years, Paige has featured in the Sun and other British tabloids, but the “respectable” middle-class media has largely ignored her. Why? Is it because Paige is a brash, blue-collar girl from East Anglia with heavy eye makeup and goth-rock stylings? Is it because wrestling is dismissed as frivolous, silly pantomiming for the great unwashed – the same people who probably voted for Brexit? Is the reason you have never heard of her good old-fashioned snobbery?I only found out about Paige three years ago, when I was contacted out of the blue by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. A former WWE superstar, Johnson was working in London in 2012 and one night in his hotel room happened to catch a Channel 4 documentary about Paige and her family. (I love picturing this scene. In my mind The Rock is chilling in a Travelodge, he’s just finished the free shortbread and an episode of Grand Designs, and on comes this film …)The Bevis family are flawed, rowdy and rough around the edges, but love one another deeply, and wrestling almost as much. Mum, dad, son and daughter all wrestle, and in 2010 the siblings got the chance to audition for WWE. It was a once-in-a-lifetime shot at making the family dream come true, but only Paige was signed her brother, Zak, was left behind. What happened next almost tore the family apart.Having come from a wrestling family, Johnson was riveted by Paige’s story and later became tangentially involved in her career. Realising her story would make a great film, he reached out to me to write the script. (I suspect Johnson only has two Englishmen in his phone – me and Jason Statham – and he clearly realised that what I lacked in charisma and muscle definition, I made up for in typing speed.)I sat down to watch the documentary, expecting to sneer at Paige and her family. Instead, I fell in love with them.I went to meet the Bevis clan in their small house on a council estate in Norwich. I discovered the documentary was just the first act of a bigger narrative, one that’s not really about wrestling at all, in the same way that Billy Elliot isn’t really about ballet. The Bevis saga is a coming-of-age tale in which the kids and the parents were forced to grow up – a funny, emotional, tough, tender, inspiring and uplifting story that just happened to involve people in threadbare tights throwing each other about.Paige moved to Florida aged 18 to join WWE’s intense training regime. She was a teenage mix of insecurity and arrogance, and often clashed with trainers and her fellow newbies, refining her raw talent in front of rowdy crowds, slowly proving herself to her paymasters and audiences while navigating the loneliness of life 4,000 miles from home.I decided that if I was going to make a film telling Paige’s story it must appeal both to wrestling fans and people like me who know nothing about her. You don’t need to like boxing to enjoy Rocky, and you don’t need to like Paige’s sport to love her journey. As I researched the script, I started to understand wrestling. I finally began to get its appeal when one performer described it to me as a “soap opera in dex”, in which the wrestlers tell stories with their bodies.I also discovered that the wrestling world has not always been a pioneer in gender equality. For instance, WWE’s female performers were often relegated to filler matches, nicknamed “bathroom breaks” by fans waiting for the next clash of brawny men. Pleasingly, however, Paige and her fellow female wrestlers have, in recent years, spearheaded what has become known as the women’s revolution, gaining more respect and airtime for the women of WWE, and garnering a passionate fanbase among audiences of all genders.While we were editing the film, the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements swiftly reached the public consciousness, and opened up a much-needed discussion about gender equality and inclusivity in all areas of life, including cinema.The fact that my movie had a female protagonist suddenly felt more significant, although I had been drawn to Paige’s story not so much because she is a woman, but because she struck me as a classic movie underdog and her teenage dreams of making it in the entertainment world chimed with my own experience. Only when I started writing the script did her gender become a bigger factor, along with something else: her class.My grandad was a bricklayer and my dad is a retired plumber, so I felt an affinity with the Bevis family, who are wrestlers but also resolutely working class. I began thinking about how many films (at least those that hope to reach general audiences) have working-class British women as their leads.There are many fine films that portray British working-class lives, including modern classics by directors such as Andrea Arnold, alongside socially conscious auteurs such as Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. These films are often brutally authentic and uncompromising, which means the multiplexes sometimes run shy of them so they become the preserve of the arthouse circuit, which can’t always draw in the wider general audience, many of whom are the very people these films are about. This catch-22 can sometimes be particularly pronounced. I recall seeing the excellent Palme d’Or winner I, Daniel Blake at a fancy north London arthouse cinema. During the harrowing scene in which Katie (Hayley Squires) is overcome with hunger at a food bank and forced to devour baked beans straight from the tin, I noticed the well-heeled man next to me was misty-eyed … while eating roasted tomato hummus and flatbread with a side of Padrón peppers. I sensed the irony escaped him.With Fighting With My Family, I wanted to take Paige’s story to both the arthouse crowd and a wider audience. I wanted to see if I could make a film about working-class people that was neither a gritty, kitchen-sink drama, nor a broad, knockabout comedy. In the years since Paige’s title win, and since beginning on my film, there has been a rising and necessary awareness of the under-representation of women, not just in cinema, but in the arts in general. These exclusions have rightly been brought into the light, yet it is revealing that a homegrown female talent like Paige has been overlooked.While we were eating our hummus and flatbread, there she was, hiding in plain sight. Marginalised for being a working-class wrestler, ignored and unheralded. I hope our film will go some way in correcting this injustice, but I am also left wondering just how many other Paiges are out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9c1d2e24ad78478e82b9f748f5a27deae698c8a/0_29_3733_2240/master/3733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb6455096df93d35c46d4f8421256447","title":"claudio ranieri fulham farewell leicester","story":"Claudio Ranieri will always be remembered with affection in England – his 2016 title win with Leicester was by some distance the greatest against-the-odds triumph the Premier League has witnessed – though a manager who has made 18 exits in five countries ought to know better than most that fairytales happen only once in a lifetime.There was no dilly-ding dilly-dong at Fulham, just the relegation clock ticking away in the background. The pizza-based incentives that supposedly came in handy at Leicester never really surfaced in London with three wins in 17 games in all competitions there was barely anything solid enough to celebrate. Ranieri remains a charming man and an intelligent coach but he is not a lucky charm after all.Fulham, it turns out, were no Leicester waiting to be whipped into shape. The failings that cost Slavisa Jokanovic his job, mostly defensive ones, stubbornly remained through his successor’s tenure. The Craven Cottage roster failed to yield a Jamie Vardy or a Riyad Mahrez capable of surprising even the most alert defences and allowing Fulham to find an effective way of playing.Leicester were a one-off, in other words. As everyone suspected, Ranieri was unable to bring the magic with him in his well-travelled suitcase, because he was unable to repeat the trick with them after the miracle season, even with the same set of players. Quite why Shahid Khan described him as a risk-free appointment is a mystery, if only because Fulham with their present squad are not in a position to assume anything is risk-free.Ranieri did a marvellous job of making Gary Lineker eat his words when the Match of the Day presenter and Leicester supporter went public with the admission he found the Foxes’ choice of manager underwhelming, though if the Italian possessed the ability to exceed everyone’s expectations he would not have had so many clubs.What Khan should probably have noticed is that relegation battles are not Ranieri’s forte. He tends to do well at middle-range clubs where he can run things fairly smoothly, as long as instant success is not demanded. After a long career in management Leicester was his first title success and, though it is true the club spent the previous season fighting relegation, by the time Ranieri replaced Nigel Pearson a unique opportunity presented itself, largely thanks to the scouting ability of Steve Walsh, who brought in N’Golo Kanté as well as Vardy and Mahrez, and the team spirit forged since promotion to the Premier League. Ranieri did not find anything remotely similar at Fulham, where morale began low and has remained so, and the money spent on strengthening following promotion in summer appears to have had little effect.When Fulham played at Manchester United in December they were three goals down by half-time and though they tightened up Ranieri warned that if they continued to be so generous they would have no chance of survival.Perhaps no one expected Fulham to prosper against top-six opponents after sacking their manager three months into their first season back in the Premier League but in the last couple of months they have lost to Burnley, Crystal Palace, West Ham and Southampton, as well as going out of the FA Cup at home to Oldham.Having spent over £100m on new players, Fulham begin the season with\u0026nbspa 2-0 home defeat\u0026nbspto Crystal Palace\u0026nbspJeers greet the final whistle as Fulham suffer a fourth heavy defeat in succession, against Bournemouth\u0026nbspat Craven CottageJokanovic feels the heat‘I am a fantastic coach’ says Slavisa Jokanovic as he comes out fighting for his job following a 1-0 loss\u0026nbspaway to HuddersfieldJokanovic is no moreJokanovic is sacked soon after a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool.

Fulham are on course for a quick return to the Championship – there is even a possibility they could yet be overtaken by the apparently hopeless Huddersfield – and far from being risk-free Ranieri has proved no more resourceful than Jokanovic. With 10 games remaining there is just about time for a new manager to turn the situation around, though for that to be the case Fulham are going to have to do a lot better at identifying a miracle worker.Ranieri will simply accept the situation with a wry smile, as he always does. At 67, he too probably ought to think long and hard about his next situation. He has already tried the semi-retirement of international management and if the right offer comes along he may consider a return but his Premier League days are surely over.While Fulham has not exactly amounted to a highlight on his CV, Ranieri has suffered disappointment and failure before. He will always have Leicester, even if the kudos did not turn out to be transferable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf73617f0d06258b55b0b1ce0ce12d9bb4fd6070/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c41559806969d7a019937cf43c56fb59","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Everton seek an elusive derby win, tiring Spurs encourage Arsenal, Rodgers returns to Watford and Dyche eyes safetyEasy to forget after Virgil van Dijk sliced a woeful shot into the sky, Jordan Pickford flapped and Divock Origi plundered the most ludicrous goal in Merseyside derby history – step aside, Sandy Brown – but Everton should have won at Anfield in December. Yerry Mina missed an early close-range header Alisson made a point-blank save from André Gomes Joe Gomez was forced to hook the rebound off the line. Had any of those gone in … but it ended how it ended, and collective confidence crashed through the floor. Spooky timing, then, that Everton put in their best performance since then at Cardiff midweek. That should provide succour and the belief to go at their arch rivals again, in the hope of reward this time. Especially as the in-form, two-goal Gylfi Sigurdsson has so often before been a thorn in Liverpool’s side. Can the Iceland international – who has scored against them four times during spells at Reading, Swansea and Everton – inspire his current side to a first derby win since Roy Hodgson was in town? SMPerhaps we can spare ourselves the twisting in knots about power balances in north London and just enjoy the fact that Saturday’s derby is set up deliciously. Arsenal and their fans are, of course, up and down like a fiddler’s elbow: two decent home wins mean they travel to Wembley with spirits relatively high and they hold genuine hope of narrowing the gap with Tottenham to a mere point. If both teams were at full throttle Spurs would win, but Mauricio Pochettino’s side have been curiously lacklustre in slipping to successive away defeats in the past week, and if the manager cannot put a finger on why then their problems may worsen. Being outbattled by Burnley was one thing making Chelsea look like the side that had enjoyed an extra day’s rest on Wednesday was something else and you wonder whether a little mental tiredness might be creeping in. In both games everything seemed to take Tottenham’s players that split-second too long is there a danger that a squad whose core has played so much football over the past 18 months is tapering off? Arsenal, and perhaps even a perked-up Mesut Özil, will look to examine the theory thoroughly. NASouthampton should have beaten Manchester United at St Mary’s in December. They were two up by the 20-minute mark, coasting, but then suffered some rank bad luck, United summoning up some resistance and showing a little backbone, an extremely rare occurrence during that grim period when José was preoccupied with his endgame. What were the chances? United are a totally different proposition now under Ole Gunnar Solskjær, but Southampton’s recent record at Old Trafford is better than many might think. A goalless draw last season, victories in 2015 and 2016, just the one loss since 2013. United are under strength, and Solskjær’s amazing unbeaten league run has to end at some point, so while victory for Saints would admittedly register as a shock, it would be far from a seismic one. SMPresumably there will be no need to scan the Vicarage Road crowd for “fraud” banners when Brendan Rodgers walks out there on Sunday, but there is still some circularity in the fact that his return to English management takes place where it all began. Rodgers was not especially popular when, in 2009, he jumped ship from Watford to their then better-off Championship rivals Reading a week after professing his commitment to the club. The fact he had dragged them out of the relegation zone the previous season tempered some of the rancour but that situation, coupled with his swift departure from Celtic, suggests Rodgers has always had one eye on what might best advance his cause. Not that there is anything wrong with that Rodgers will be hoping, though, that he lasts rather longer at Leicester than the six months he spent at the Madejski Stadium and at first glance he inherits a group of players that should not find his preferred brand of football too taxing. How they will fare against this season’s Watford side – fresh from a five-goal away haul and a five-goal away hiding in the space of five days – is anyone’s guess but instinctively it seems that he may have found a place where he can stick around. NAWith one trophy in the bag and three more to be competed for, the fixtures in the last few months of the season will start to stack up for Manchester City. This run of Premier League games – the win over West Ham on Wednesday, Saturday’s trip to Bournemouth and the following weekend’s home match against Watford – should theoretically be the time for Pep Guardiola to rotate his squad to ensure the top men are as fresh as possible for more strident challenges ahead. However, against the Hammers Guardiola was forced to smash glass and retrieve a pair of emergency wingers in the shape of Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva, because Leroy Sané and Riyad Mahrez weren’t up to snuff. “We needed a little bit more,” he said. “We arrived in the positions of the wingers and we didn’t finish what we created.” City need the likes of Sané and Mahrez to be reliable, but the likes of Sané and Mahrez need to perform for their own benefit too. NMTwo freshly promoted teams here, whose experiences this season upon returning to the big time have been markedly different. Wolves have got the punditocracy cooing with their progressive stylings, and they’re a fair shout to end the campaign as Best Of The Rest (seventh place being a thing now, apparently). Cardiff by contrast are sullied with a meat-and-potatoes reputation and have struggled to stay out of the drop zone since the get-go. Only one winner, some may think. But Cardiff beat Wolves in Wales in November, Junior Hoilett completing a turnaround victory with one of the goals – the goal? – of the season so far. Cardiff also won this fixture last season in the Championship. Those results form part of an overall excellent recent record against Wolves, the Bluebirds winning five of the past seven meetings. How precious it would be for 18th-placed Cardiff to keep that run going?

Maurizio Sarri’s side have regained their composure and dignity following the win against Tottenham but things could easily spiral out of control again should they lose, or even draw, at Craven Cottage on Sunday. As such, the visitors will need to repeat the togetherness they displayed against Spurs – and indeed for much of the Carabao Cup final – as well as deliver the ruthlessness required in attack to secure all three points. Then, of course, there is the goalkeeper - who does Sarri pick? From the outside, at least, it feels like an easy choice: Stick with Willy. SNIn one sense, the fact Fulham and Huddersfield are so far adrift of safety makes the battle to avoid the final relegation place more intense. Everyone from 13th to 18th is – with the strange exception of freefalling Brighton – picking up wins here and there, meaning the picture can change in one weekend. Both Burnley (18 points from their past 10 games) and Palace (14 from 10) seem in decent enough nick to be comfortable at the season’s end, despite midweek defeats. But if either side loses at Turf Moor they could find themselves back in the mire, perhaps only one more reverse from severe danger. It makes this meeting akin to a six-pointer and Burnley will expect a return to the intensity that shocked Tottenham last week. Sean Dyche’s achievement in coaxing his side back to their old levels and out of a truly dire-looking situation should not be underestimated: it is tremendously hard to do and many managers do not even get the chance. Another big effort here can put them within tantalising reach of finishing the job and, perhaps, a feat on a par with anything Dyche has managed with the Clarets. NAFor Chris Hughton it is time to stick on Think Twice by Celine Dion and listen to the first line of the pre-chorus. “This is getting serious,” sings the Canadian warbler, and for Brighton it really is. Five defeats and a draw from their past six league games leaves Hughton’s men just two places and two points above the relegation zone. They need to stop the rot and have the perfect chance to do so this weekend given bottom-place Huddersfield are the visitors to the Amex Stadium. But after their win over Wolves, this suddenly feels like a dangerous fixture for the hosts. They simply must win, however, and can take heart from the fact they have scored in each of their past four games in all competitions. SNFor a while back there, these two famous old clubs looked in a spot of trouble. West Ham had lost their first four fixtures of the campaign and were rock bottom, while Newcastle weren’t in much better nick, having picked up only one point from the first 12 on offer. Season-long relegation battles were mentioned in dispatches. But it’s not quite panned out like that, two top-drawer managers turning things around to the extent that both sides are now relatively comfortable in mid-table. Manuel Pellegrini’s team trounced the Toon 3-0 during their December hot streak, but Rafa Benítez’s side have grown in confidence since the turn of the year, and Newcastle won at the London Stadium last time around.

Fast-forward to this weekend, when Newcastle travel to West Ham and Longstaff, just like Declan Rice, will be one of the first names on the team-sheet. Longstaff’s form has drawn inevitable comparisons with another Geordie, famed for his poise, vision and assurance:Talking of Leeds, life under Marcelo Bielsa is truly a world away from the, er, halcyon days of David Hockaday’s reign: The signings of Gaetano Berardi – “who was kung fu-ing everybody and getting sent off every game” – and Giuseppe Bellusci – “he thought he was a hard man but was an absolute pussy” – compounded Hockaday’s frustration and he says he was shut down after recommending Virgil van Dijk, then of Celtic, as well as Craig Cathcart and Mark Hudson as preferred centre-back options. A move for Conor Coady, available on a free, never made it past Cellino either. “Flipping heck,” Hockaday says, asked about what might have been. “Don’t make me cry. I was scratching my head being told ‘no’ about those I had recommended while we were getting in these Italian-based players who were nowhere near it and, I have got to say, that’s what killed me.” Hockaday fought to convince Cellino, who he says liked to be referred to as “Mr President”, to pay for food after training. “It was the most dysfunctional squad I’ve ever played with, trained with, coached – whatever. It was a terrible environment.”There is a humdinger of a game on the cards at Elland Road this evening, when Leeds take on West Bromwich Albion. Darren Moore’s side have paid £10,000 to ferry Baggies fans to Yorkshire on 20 coaches, and the head coach says the gesture is a sign of happier times. “When you think of where we were 10 months ago, we were ided as a football club and I didn’t like it,” Moore said. “This is almost a mini reminder of where we were and where we’re now at. It’s great to see. The ground is full again, the fans are in good voice again. Now on the road, the players appreciate the fans coming to support at the end of a working week.”Early bird Eddie Howe has finished his press conference, and says Bournemouth could welcome striker Callum Wilson back to the fold at home to Manchester City tomorrow. David Brooks, who remained on the bench at Arsenal in midweek, could be promoted to the starting lineup. Brooks was on the books at City for 10 years, before leaving for Sheffield United in 2014. “We’re still without Junior Stanislas, Dom Solanke and Steve Cook,” Howe said. “Callum Wilson has been making good progress, so we’ll have to make a late call on him. David Brooks to start? He’s fit enough to be involved and the injury is fine, but we need him to be right at it. Again, we’ll assess him and make a late decision.”The Crystal Palace manager, Roy Hodgson, was first in line to pay tribute to Claudio Ranieri, after his former club Fulham sacked the Italian on Thursday. The first-team coach, Scott Parker, has taken caretaker charge of the club – 10 points adrift of safety after defeat at Southampton – until the end of the season. Hodgson, the oldest manager to ever grace the Premier League at the tender age of 71, said: “I find it sad after as little as two or three months he has been shown the door by Fulham. It disappoints me Fulham, a club I really like, I have so much time for, have found it necessary to make this quite controversial decision.”Will Everton end their nine-year hoodoo over Liverpool, will Maurizio Sarri stick or twist with Willy Caballero, and should Brighton be worried? That and seven more other unmissable things to look out for this weekend, right here:There is plenty of talk around David de Gea’s future on the back pages this morning, with some noise that the goalkeeper is close to extending his contract at Manchester United. Ole Gunnar Solskjær will be previewing their match at home to Southampton any minute now and, with a bit of luck, may just clear things up in terms of any potential De Gea deal. The Spaniard reportedly wants to be paid the same as Alexis Sánchez: £400,000-a-week. Phil Jones and Anthony Martial have already committed their future in recent weeks. Meanwhile, talking of word on the street:Good morning. A bumper weekend of Premier League action awaits, headlined by the north London derby on Saturday before the Merseyside equivalent the next day. In between all of that, there is the small fry of Brendan Rodgers’s first game in the Leicester hot-seat at Watford, where his managerial career started in earnest all those moons ago Rodgers will be formally unveiled to the media later this afternoon. Another – loosely – new face – in the dugout on Sunday will be Scott Parker, put in caretaker charge of Fulham following Claudio Ranieri’s sacking we will also hear from him a little bit later. No matches on Monday, except the Steel City derby (and Partick Thistle v Hearts), means all of the big names are shoehorned into just two days of mouthwatering action, with Manchester City on the road and Manchester United at Old Trafford. Down in the Championship, there is a John Terry v Frank Lampard duel of sorts as Aston Villa host Derby, while the league leaders Norwich can extend their winning run at lowly Millwall."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7d72e243c6dad35bab63cf4c8c223a6c95280c8/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e42e92529ed5dbb813787e2ffdb3a20c","title":"like test driving a car how virtual investing prepares you for the real thing","story":"Virtual trading platforms are demystifying the world of trading, and opening up the potential rewards to the general publicInvesting is no longer the preserve of moneyed men of a certain age. It’s something anyone who cares about their financial future should consider.The old adage that investments can go down as well as up remains true, but investing makes sense for anyone keen to see a high rate of return over the long term. Yet a common misconception prevails that cash savings are safe, whereas investments are risky.That’s not true, according to Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at investment platform Willis Owen. He believes anyone looking to save money over a period of 10 years or more should seriously consider investments.“Cash savings aren’t what they once were, and don’t deliver over the long term because they offer interest rates below the rate of inflation. That means the spending power of your savings actually falls over time,” he says.“More than ever before, we need to invest for retirement.”Opening a cash Isa is one thing, but investing in stocks and shares can feel scary by comparison. Lowcock thinks we should see it as a natural progression, and says investing isn’t as risky as its reputation suggests.“If you’re investing for the long term, there are ways of building a portfolio that aren’t high-risk,” he says. “While there’ll be lots of volatility in the underlying investments over the long term, investments in stock markets generally go up over that time period.”With so many fund options out there, picking solutions for your own investment can be complex. Willis Owen has developed a virtual investment tool called Play, which enables users to become seasoned investors without parting with a penny. It replicates what happens on the stock market, so users can research funds and invest up to £10,000 of virtual money in a portfolio.“It’s like taking a car for a test drive before you buy” says Jason Chapman, managing director of Willis Owen. “With little or no investment experience, you can get to grips with everyday investment risks and opportunities, and experience everything from picking a sum and making an investment decision to handling the transaction and monitoring the portfolio.”A virtual investment tool helped Andrew Buchanan, 24, get to grips with investing in the US stock market. “I wanted to better understand what influenced the share price of the major blue-chip companies in the US, so my goal in using the tool was to test my theories on various pieces of financial news, without putting any capital at risk,” he says.“I’d read about various trading strategies, and the tool enabled me to put them to the test to see how they played out in practice. I also wanted to learn more about the metrics that were available, and I could see the sort of data people were using in the pits.”Virtual investment tools aren’t just for those who are new to investing, however. Seasoned investors can replicate their live portfolio and try out different investment strategies risk-free.Jacqueline Mitton has been investing in unit trusts for more than 30 years, managing her own portfolio for most of that time. Using Play allowed her to experiment with an investment strategy that she was too nervous to apply to her live portfolio.“In my live portfolio, my investment strategy has been rather cautious I’m not a risk taker by nature, and I didn’t imagine I’d invest in any of my Play funds in the real world,” she says. “But building on what I’ve learned, I’ve now decided to put aside a sum of money for investing more adventurously.”Owning your financial future can be a daunting prospect. But using investment products is as easy as any other money-related activity, be that transferring your balance to a new credit card or taking your lunch to work to save cash. A virtual investment tool can help users develop confidence – the lack of which holds many people back from investing.“There’s a conception that investing is complex, but the actual transaction can be done as easily as buying something from Amazon,” says Lowcock.Nonetheless, there’s a big difference between spending £5.99 on a book and putting £1,000 into an Isa. “Investing is a completely different feeling and experience it’s not a physical product and you don’t get next-day delivery on it. Play enables you to gain essential expertise and build confidence before taking that first step.”With a live investment portfolio, mistakes can be costly. With a virtual tool, you can apply valuable lessons learned to your live portfolio. “You will make mistakes as an investor, regardless of whether you’re new, very experienced or even a professional, but how you handle those mistakes is crucial to your success,” says Lowcock.“One of the biggest investing mistakes most people make is selling the moment their investments fall in value and the markets drop, but with a virtual portfolio you can afford to wait and watch it recover, because you’re not losing anything.”It’s no surprise that people put off decisions about investing, but Chapman recommends spending as much time planning for your retirement and financial future as you do planning your next holiday. You don’t need a meaningful sum of money to invest, either.“People worry that their investment could fall significantly in value, but that’s unlikely to happen if you’re well ersified, and you can start investing with as little as £25-£50 per month,” he says.“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket buy a range of funds to reduce the risk and ensure you’ve got exposure to other markets beyond the UK, where people are concerned about Brexit,” he advises.“If you’re not putting too much in up front then just enjoy the experience,” adds Lowcock. “And remember why you’re doing this – for your family’s future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae8b3ef382a033076d2f10cb06dd04266f21d64/2017_190_4262_2557/master/4262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=123c62c6ca7012e11defe065f7411778","title":"my dad was proud of me for organising my pension how one freelancer shored up her future","story":"For the self-employed, a pension can seem impossible – but it doesn’t have to beFreelance writer Rachel Spencer was 34 when she made the leap and set up her first pension – caving in after her financially savvy father badgered her to do it. “My dad was really amazing with money and he explained to me that that a self-invested personal pension (Sipp) was a great way of generating a lot of money if you put in a decent amount every year. Back then it was the glory days of journalism, so I put in about £500 a month for two to three years.” A decade later, Spencer is happy to have been swayed by her father. “I’ve made a decent amount of money through it so far, with £18,000 saved from putting in £12,000,” she says.Spencer, who lives in Newcastle with her partner and also runs a PR consultancy called Publicity for Pet Businesses, was attracted to the flexibility offered by a Sipp. “I didn’t want the commitment of putting into a pension forever,” she says. “I was earning good money at the time and thought rather than wasting it I would start plotting ahead for when I’m older. In my early 30s I was single and I didn’t have other big commitments – and I knew, as a freelancer, income can be hit and miss and you don’t know what’s round the corner. My dad died a few years ago, but I know he was proud of me for organising my pension.”Sipps put the customer in the driving seat, rather than leaving the pension provider to allocate your money to different funds. You decide when, where and how you invest your money, whether that’s in inidual stocks and shares and government and corporate bonds, or exchange-traded funds and commercial property.“A Sipp allows you to be in charge of the investment decisions,” explains Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen. “Previously, people didn’t have control over their pensions. Now you can choose where to invest, or you can delegate it to another party. You can be risky or cautious, or somewhere in between. At Willis Owen, we research funds, provide starter portfolios and offer help to anyone investing. We also offer a one-stop shop fund solution, where the manager is making decisions on your behalf to suit your appetite for risk.”Lowcock says Sipps provide more transparency than your typical pension. “Even if you’ve delegated it to someone else, you can still log in and see your investments 24 hours a day,” he says. “You can also move your investments around quite easily.”Organising a Sipp is straightforward: just apply online at the provider you choose and invest a minimum of £25. The whole process takes about 10-15 minutes, although Lowcock warns that if finances are tight and you’re already worried about making your mortgage repayments, you should think carefully before choosing a Sipp investments can go up or down.You can also press pause on your Sipp if those contributions are needed elsewhere. Spencer, now 43, bought her first house in Warrington when she was just 25, and invested in a property in Lymm in Cheshire with the profits. She has since bought a second property, in Newcastle. “I like the fact I can stop paying into it when I need to focus on other things in my life, but I will restart it again soon,” she says.Looking ahead, Spencer is set to be financially comfortable in her retirement. “I know I’ll have property income and a safety net from my pension.” But there won’t be any sitting on her laurels, as the pet-lover plans to set up a dog-friendly holiday home business.“I spend as much time as possible travelling and seeing different places with my dog, Patch, so I would love to be able to create my own weekend retreats for dogs and their owners,” she says. “I’ve always been a grafter and I can’t imagine doing nothing in my retirement, so creating amazing experiences for other crazy dog people like me would be ideal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c304e6fa18274d2bc5fe3c7c3568cd692af8ebb/0_99_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fd907e73f186f5f81838579cdfdc6e4","title":"struggling to sleep share your experiences","story":"If you have problems sleeping at night we’d like to hear from you is planning a new video project about sleep.We’re hoping to understand more about how people are affected by sleep problems and would like readers to tell us how they navigate sleepless nights.We want to include first-person video testimony from our readers.

We’ll be looking at the psychological cycles of buying, as well as the changes that need to come from government level. We want to gather questions from readers and supporters who are experts in related fields, but also those who have personal experiences or reflections to share. In particular we’re looking for positive solutions-based ideas about how we can improve the situation.Lucy Siegle, MP Mary Creagh, and others will be discussing this issue in our next recording. To share your questions, reflections and ideas with them, please email us at: weneedtotalkabout@… providing your question along with your name, age, and country of residence.The fashion industry is big business. In the UK alone, it was worth £32 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, “outstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications”. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as iniduals, play in improving this growing issue?The UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Huge numbers of brands still depend on vastly underpaid workers to make clothing meet consumer demand. In 2013’s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.In addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled – it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, £140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.The Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore ‘ethical’ designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world’s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.Other prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of ‘eating’ plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?We look forward to hearing from you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcc53398a5a114b992d6d6d9f4236c8d9a8d7c3b/0_0_5274_3675/master/5274.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e53f7af42eb5a16fb0e790dded7cf9be 880w","title":"the evolution of ernie the national savings investment machine","story":"The original Ernie was launched in 1957 by the appropriately named post master general, Ernest Marples, to generate random numbers for NS\u0026ampI’s premium bonds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1bdbec0836b3c0d339b04780d58b9602ddf8e31/0_0_4511_2707/master/4511.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f1392ef41ec8499bc5aaf196d1bd6dd","title":"andre previn a life in pictures","story":"The Oscar-winning composer and conductor has died at the age of 89, leaving behind an illustrious career ning film, jazz, classical and pop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a560dffd9e5f30818eceea0960fac955c3bdebaf/0_121_5105_3062/master/5105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=433dec13629644f11199c1906e5a06e3","title":"hard brexit tories a party within a party","story":"’s Dan Sabbagh and Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan explore whether the European Research Group is as influential as ever - or has it overplayed its hand on Brexit?

The positions were announced in alphabetical order.TIG has had a mixed first full week in Westminster. A second referendum motion its members put down was not accepted by the Speaker, John Bercow, in Wednesday’s Brexit debate.Berger was not selected at prime minister’s questions by Bercow earlier on Wednesday despite hoping to be called on to quiz Theresa May.Angela Smith, who was forced to apologise after referring to people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds as having a “funny tinge”, is taking on a broad portfolio including transport, local government and housing, energy and environment.Sarah Wollaston, the former Conservative GP turned MP, has not taken on a policy brief but has instead taken on responsibility for new members. The group has said it wants to introduce a procedure for admitting people.Allen had previously said that she did not want TIG to become a home for “waifs and strays” such as the MPs John Woodcock and Ivan Lewis, both of whom left Labour with harassment allegations unresolved.The appointments follow a series of meetings this week. On Monday, Gavin Shuker, the former Labour MP who represents Luton South, was named as group convenor, who will organise its meetings.

The office said it was seeking “comprehensive market access for US agricultural goods in the UK”.It was also looking to remove “unwarranted barriers” related to “sanitary and physiosanitary” standards in the farm industry, something that would put it at loggerheads with the environment secretary, Michael Gove, who has repeatedly said British food standards will remain the same if not better than they currently are.The US has long considered EU rules on food a barrier to trade and has said fears that its food is unsafe to eat because of differences in production rules – including use of pesticides, chlorine and hormones – are unwarranted.A change in food standards after Brexit would have ramifications for an open border in Ireland as it would fuel fears that banned goods could seep into the food chain through cross-border production of meat and dairy products.Apart from differences of regulation in relation to the use of chlorine to wash chicken and the use of hormones in the rearing of cattle, US officials have also recently spoken about barriers in pork production.Gove has held firm on his position that the UK would not compromise on food standards. He has in the past expressed concern about antibiotics used for livestock and bee-harming pesticides, neonicotinoids, used on grain that goes into breakfast cereals and other consumer foods.The outline trade objectives were published weeks after the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, revealed that some countries wanted the UK to roll back on its human rights standards in exchange for a deal.In December a former Conservative environment minister said food safety in the UK and public confidence in it would be placed at risk if the government pursued a free-trade agreement with the US.If imports of US-standard food were allowed, “you would have a huge decline in food safety”, said Lord Deben, now chairman of the Committee on Climate Change. “Food safety is a huge issue.”Under the “fast-track trade negotiating authority law, the US will seek to boost trade between the countries by eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers”, the US trade representative’s office said.It aimed to smooth regulatory differences “reduce burdens associated with unnecessary differences in regulation”, it said in the document.President Donald Trump has demanded better terms of trade, saying poor deals have cost the US millions of jobs.The US is also seeking commitments from the UK to establish “state-of-the-art” rules to ensure cross-border data flows and not to impose customs duties on digital products.It also wants guarantees on currency, with rules to “ensure that the UK avoids manipulating exchange rates in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6acc06f59d0f4a12d186edf215052acc48bff1c8/0_231_5074_3045/master/5074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60b9f9a197b8999c23cac1d6f721e0b1","title":"fair start children england punitive government","story":"Families desperately need joined-up support, but ministers refuse to see how their policies set up poor children to failChildren in England are facing their own hostile environment, with government policy undermining their right to a fair start in life and support for families systematically dismantled since 2010.First 1,000 days of life, published this week by the Commons health and social care committee, exposes the extent of the damage – and the impact it has had.The MPs’ report lays bare the desperate need for coordinated support for infants and their families. Under New Labour, resources were poured in to supporting children’s early years. Benefits were increased, children’s services were expanded, child poverty was targeted, the Healthy Child Programme was introduced and Sure Start centres were established across the country.Much government policy now focuses on intervening later in childhood to tackle issues such as obesity and poor mental health. Care and support in the first years of life are patchy and fragmented.The extent to which our life chances are determined in the first months of life is terrifying. According to evidence from Barnardo’s and the Health Foundation, a child whose development falls behind during their first years is far more likely to be left even further behind as they get older than to catch up.There are myriad ways parents can harm their children in the early years, including poor diet, smoking, alcohol and substance misuse, domestic violence, poor parenting skills and choosing not to immunise them.According to the children’s commissioner, almost 200,000 children under the age of one live with an adult who has experienced domestic violence or abuse, around 300,000 live with an adult who has a mental illness, and more than 100,000 live with an adult who have drug or alcohol problems. Factors such as smoking and obesity in pregnancy are strongly linked to low income, insecure employment and poor housing.The committee’s MPs believe the answer is to take a joined-up approach to population health, looking at the homes and communities where people live, how they are supported by the NHS and social care, and how other aspects of their lives impact on their health. They plead for the government to consider the needs of vulnerable families in all its policies.The reality is that the needs of vulnerable families are repeatedly ignored. Cutting local services, cutting welfare funding while rolling out universal credit, and failing to take robust action against companies making money out of childhood obesity all set poor families up to fail.It was the government’s refusal to understand that its policies are responsible for poverty which fed the palpable anger of Prof Philip Alston, United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, when he reported on the UK last year. He concluded: “For almost one in every two children to be poor in twenty-first century Britain is not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster, all rolled into one.”The Big Lottery Fund has invested a total of £215m over 10 years in Blackpool, Bradford, Lambeth, Nottingham and Southend to support Better Start projects led by the NSPCC. The aim is to tackle risk factors such as drugs, alcohol, mental illness, domestic abuse and social isolation. Work includes strengthening collaboration between councils, the NHS, the voluntary sector and police.But it leaves the uneasy feeling that lottery funding is backfilling holes left by local government cuts. It is ameliorating the problem, not getting to the heart of it.The UN, parliament, councils, the children’s commissioner, charities and thinktanks provide overwhelming evidence of the impact of government policy. But ministers are not listening.• Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91fe5e45aa65e0d9d18f2f583947102163ba934e/94_12_2690_1613/master/2690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f82b83ba14ed7c459fa4fdea8b9b154","title":"laura muir european indoor championships","story":"• Scot hopes new approach will help in 1500m and 3,000m races• Muir would be first ever athlete to repeat double win in 2017The last time Laura Muir raced at a major championships in Glasgow, the hype and hope weighed her down like an anvil. Now, five years on from flopping at the Commonwealth Games, Muir is relishing the chance to make history at the European Indoor Championships.If all goes to plan the 25-year-old will claim 3,000m gold on Friday night and then rapidly follow it up with a 1500m title on Sunday – an achievement that would not only repeat her success in Belgrade two years ago but also make her the first person, male or female, to ever achieve a “double-double” at these championships.“Five years ago I struggled with pressure quite a lot,” admitted Muir, who finished 11th in the 1500m before pulling out of the 800m. “I just got really nervous and found that I didn’t race very well. Now I have psychologically flipped things and it has worked really well. I had a lot of pressure for Berlin last year for the outdoors but I dealt with that fine and came away with the win. So coming into Glasgow I feel more relaxed and more excited than anything.”Not that it will be easy given that the German Konstanze Klosterhalfen, who has kicked on impressively since joining Alberto Salazar’s Nike Oregon Project group, is lurking in the 3,000m. To add to Muir’s challenge, she also has to race in the heats of the 1500m two and a half hours’ before the 3,000m.However, the Scot is confident of rising to the challenge. “We would only do it if I was fit enough to do it,” she said. “I don’t want to go out there and do a mediocre performance. I want to go out there and smash it.”Her coach, Andy Young, meanwhile, bills the 3,000m final as the race of the championships. “It’s an absolutely epic race, like Mary Decker-Slaney v Zola Budd in the 80s,” he says, with a smile. “Let’s just hope it ends better than it did for those two in 1984.”Muir proved her form a fortnight ago by smashing the British indoor mile record by more than five seconds, but there were suggestions afterwards that her racing spikes may have been a prototype and thus illegal. Young, however, dismissed it as “a bit of a “non-story. The last time I checked there was no complaint.“We brought them in for training rather than racing, but she liked them,” he added, pointing out that other athletes had worn the same-type spikes last summer. “I think she could have run near enough in high heels in Birmingham and it wouldn’t have made any difference.”With Muir primed for success, the British team are hopeful of exceeding the 10 medals they won at this event in Belgrade in 2017, and they should get a second gold on the opening night with Katarina Johnson-Thompson an overwhelming favourite in the women’s pentathlon.It helps the Briton’s case that the reigning champion, Nafi Thiam, is absent with a calf injury. However Johnson-Thompson, who believes she is in the best condition of her career, lamented the opportunity to put one over her great Belgium rival. “I’m sad she’s not here,” she said. “I love competing against her. I love the battle of it. I think she brings out the best in me.”Elsewhere Jakob Ingebrigtsen, the brilliant teenage Norwegian, is favourite to win gold in the men’s 1500m and 3000m, while the German pole vaulter Katha Bauer will become the first athlete to compete in a major championships with a defibrillator, which she had fitted last year, although she is unlikely to win a medal.However, the British team captain, Guy Learmonth, who is competing with a broken finger and badly bruised ribs sustained at the Birmingham grand prix two weeks ago, believes he can overcome his own medical problems in the men’s 800m. “If I break my hand in the process of winning, I won’t care,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5064ca0e9c93b3f60981d173103342168473b88/0_183_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce109e57cbf8de061fbb1a175b0e18d6","title":"rugby union world league","story":"Imagine a tent on an exposed clifftop being buffeted by gale force winds. Those inside are already grimly clinging on, only for so-called friends to sneak round and remove all the pegs. Welcome to the world of professional rugby union, where just about every aspect of the game’s future is up in the air.From player welfare and concussion to commercial uncertainty and political wrangling, there are days when it feels as if rugby is in serious danger of losing its bearings completely. That certainly seems to be the consensus among leading players, supporters and administrators following the publication of the latest blueprint for a proposed World League, a 12-team annual tournament meant to revitalise the traditional Test game for the benefit of all.Some of the detail was as chilling as it was brazen. Instead of Fiji, ranked ninth in the world, and Georgia (ranked 12th), the leaked proposal suggested places would be reserved instead for Japan and the US (ranked 11th and 13th respectively) on the basis of their bigger economies. Top-level rugby a game for nations of all shapes and sizes? Not any more.“The death of Pacific Island rugby” is how it has been described by one horrified union chief executive he might have added that, were it to happen, international rugby will officially forfeit its soul. What kind of sport regards it as progress to suffocate the international aspirations of countries which, pound for pound, produce the best raw rugby talent on the planet? What kind of reputable global leisure industry decides it only wants to hang out with its well-heeled mates, cutting adrift anyone without a well-stuffed wallet? And what does it do both for the standard of rugby in countries outside the elite and the competitiveness of future World Cups?No wonder the game’s governing body, World Rugby, was quick to try to douse the resultant flames. Nothing is set in stone, only a proposal, not what we are trying to achieve etc, etc. Technically, too, World Rugby’s office holders are only the functionaries of the member unions, rather than white cat-stroking madmen operating on a whim. That said, someone with a bit of influence – and the fingerprints of one prominent rugby nation were all over the NZ Herald story – would clearly love this latest cynical world domination plan to happen.And why not, given it would guarantee a dozen years of prime broadcasting dosh and, potentially, access to loads more talented Pacific Island players? Why hang around and represent Fiji for the simple honour and privilege when you can provide for all of your extended family by playing in more compelling matches of a higher standard elsewhere? Even with a five-year qualification period, that is likely to be a better bet than spending 12 years with your nose pressed up to the window of the executive lounge.There will, inevitably, be further twists to this saga. One theory is that this is all about seeking to push the Six Nations towards agreeing in future to promotion and relegation – or a play-off at the very least. After all, is a closed shop not what already exists in Europe? If the Six Nations wishes to stick to its establishment membership, how can any of the home unions complain about the system being not strictly meritocratic elsewhere?The one thing that everyone appears to agree on is that something has to change. Rugby cannot endlessly live on the razor-wire separating the rival international and club games a way also has to be found to make the physical and mental demands on its players more manageable.As the International Rugby Players’ forceful statement emphasised, the sport’s leading names are already buckling under the strain even before they are asked to commit to five Tests on successive autumn weekends plus increased long-haul air travel. Johnny Sexton, the player organisation’s president, described the latest proposals as “out of touch” and, as such, they do not currently have the players’ support.Reforming the ad-hoc Test schedule and dovetailing it better with domestic fixture lists has topped the game’s wish-list for almost three decades now. In that sense nothing has changed, other than the feeling of urgency. “If you ask me as a businessman, the business side of rugby is not working,” said World Rugby’s vice-chairman, Agustín Pichot, in September, urging everyone within the game to come to their senses. “If you ask me the playing side is not working. Is the international game under threat? I think it is. I’m not going to be an accomplice to rugby’s ruin.”Almost six months further down the line, that last phrase continues to resonate. Rugby urgently needs to find proper answers with player welfare at their heart. Cutting off the have-nots to make life cosier for the haves cannot be the way forward if rugby wishes to retain even a semblance of a collective conscience.

Such was his impact on his hometown club throughout a glittering two-decade career, the Saints christened the move to their new stadium with a statue of him taking pride of place outside.When he retired, the thankless task of succeeding him fell on the shoulders of James Roby yet at this rate, there is a fair chance Roby may get his own statue by the time he retires, too. Such was the nature of this performance from St Helens, it would be unfair to simply attribute their fourth consecutive victory to the 33-year-old but how he played a telling role here.By the end, Roby had combined with stand-off Théo Fages to menacing effect, scoring two tries and producing another lung-busting display to help the Saints move top of the table and continue their unbeaten start to 2019. “That performance adds to his legendary status, and it’s fully deserved,” Roby’s coach, Justin Holbrook, said.Fages was equally deserving of the plaudits here too, though. The French international was a surprise pick ahead of Danny Richardson in the halves at the start of this season, but he was crucial in helping the Saints establish a 16-0 lead here which, realistically, an injury-hit, out-of-sorts Salford were never likely to overcome.Fages’ pinpoint kick for Mark Percival helped open the scoring, before the stand-off combined with half-back partner Jonny Lomax to make it 10-0. Roby then took centre-stage, scoring instinctively out of dummy-half and even then, before half-time, it was clear Salford would not be able to threaten a resolute St Helens defence enough to overturn the deficit.“St Helens were outstanding defensively,” said the Salford coach, Ian Watson. His side still have an impressive record of three wins from five to start the season, but will count the cost of a number of key injuries to forwards here which made their task a near-impossible one. They battled commendably – underlined by Derrell Olpherts’ try after half-time, but that was as good as it got.After Lomax and Lachlan Coote combined to free winger Regan Grace for St Helens’ fourth try, it was fitting that Fages and Roby had the final say. Fages’ wonderful pass freed Tommy Makinson downfield and though he was felled by two Salford defenders, Roby defied his age to react quickest and scamper over for his second try.Widnes Vikings have confirmed that a deal to bring the Championship club out of administration has been agreed. The former world champions announced last week that they were going into administration due to mounting financial issues – which resulted in the postponement of their league fixture against Sheffield last Sunday.However, subject to approval from the Rugby Football League, which is expected to be granted on Friday, a consortium headed by the local businessman Chris Price will assume control of the Vikings and ensure the club will avoid the threat of liquidation. “On Thursday, a consortium came together with the administrators and agreed a deal in principle to take the club forward,” the Vikings said in a brief statement.Widnes also revealed that should RFL approval be granted, the club expect their league fixture against Featherstone this weekend to take place – though per the governing body’s operational rules, Widnes will start that game on -8 points following the 12-point penalty they will incur for entering administration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716c3a6c78b435d213cc65f413275c259a0905d9/0_246_7301_4382/master/7301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b00bc26267b3b157b8cbab85cf801a6","title":"tip a great beach cafe or bar in europe for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Good food and drink can set a beach venue apart from the rest, especially if there’s a cool view.

Moments earlier, a rock the size of my head had come crashing down. Myself and my fellow climbers shouted at the top of our voices and watched with relief as it came thudding to a halt a couple of hundred metres beneath us. No one was hurt.And, truth be told, it was all my fault. I have only been climbing for little more than a year, and I’d been abseiling down an adjacent face in Rockaway Gully, Tasmania, when I dislodged the rock with my foot. I’d been hoping to get a better shot of my guide John Fischer, who was about to give our climbing trip another dramatic twist. But we’ll get to that later.I’d come to Hobart principally for the Australian Wooden Boat Festival, an event held every two years to celebrate all types of sailing vessels, from tall ships and dinghies to canoes and kayaks. The docks of the old whaling port were awash with masts and sails, and sunburnt sailors littered the harbour.I’d rowed into town with a crew of Scots and Tasmanians aboard a traditional five-oared St Ayles skiff. We’d been part of a 10-day small sailing and rowing boat expedition from Recherche Bay in far south Tasmania to the boat festival, a distance of 100 nautical miles. By the time we arrived, we all poured into the historic Hope and Anchor Tavern on Macquarie Street to down a few well-earned ales amid the cutlasses, hagbuts and harpoons that decorate the walls, and lead the raucous mob in rowdy sea shanties.From there, we dragged ourselves down Liverpool Street to crash at the comfortably crummy Pickled Frog Backpackers hostel, which boasts that, over the years, it’s “hosted sailors, whalers, smugglers, gold-diggers, daredevils and wanderers” (12-bed dorms from Aus$26£14 a night). The following morning, I surveyed the litter of casualties curled up on the worn sofas of the lounge, and began to think about my other purpose in visiting Hobart: climbing.Mount Wellington is 20 minutes from Hobart, and has 400 climbing routes tucked in the rock formations beneath its summit. One of them is a circuit called the Organ Pipes, where the dolerite rock is similar to basalt: columnar with “splitter cracks” and as grippy as rough sandpaper.My guide was tousle-haired John Fischer, aka Crazy John, an American immigrant to Tasmania, who in 2015 made Isle of Rock, the first film about rock climbing on the island. We were going to climb Fiddlesticks on Flange Buttress, a medium grade 60m gem of a climb, executed in two pitches. I gracefully declined John’s offer to lead and instead followed his fluid and skilful upward motion, playing out rope. John also offers non-climbers an abseiling-only option opening up the roped experience to all, regardless of ability.By the time we were halfway up, the clouds were parting, the sun was flashing a smile and the views down the Derwent and across to Bruny Island were stunning. “It is one of the better routes of its grade in the whole country,” John said. The hard bits are not too hard, the rock is extremely grippy and all I had to do was trust in the rubber of my climbing shoes. After a celebratory chat at the top, we abseiled back down to our packs.John has a touch of the “dirtbag” about him. And that is not at all pejorative. American climber Fred “Dirtbag” Beckey (14 January 1923 – 30 October 2017) slept in cars, ate junk food, eschewed patronage and just lived to climb, claiming hundreds of first ascents. “Will belay for food” read his cardboard hitchhiking sign. John had not brought any lunch and had asked fellow climber David Tan to meet him at the summit with a cheeseburger from the urban valley below. It was eagerly anticipated, yet when David arrived he had brought no such luxuries. Instead, he rummaged around in his van like an ibis, a bird unaffectionately nicknamed the “bin-chicken”, to find a curried veggie pie – only a bit past its “sell by date” – and proffered it as an apology.By the afternoon, John and David were scaling Albert’s Tomb, a 10-metre needle of rock which is extremely difficult to climb.They were vying with some real life bin-chickens for a perch atop the narrow column. But John’s aim was more ambitious: to jump to the adjacent cliff-face and back, a feat he had performed years earlier. I was watching from on a nearby face, peering anxiously through my camera. David was egging him on from below.Suddenly, John sprang forward and, somehow, his palms stuck to the coarse cliff opposite.He climbed a little higher and then dropped like a hawk back on to the table top of the plinth. I exhaled and took my finger off the shutter button."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075a4aa2a3dfecd862834e82763067ec969f3e21/0_479_5098_3059/master/5098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a5e350e512321fe12ac3154b36b678","title":"yukon canoe canadian wilderness stanfords adam weymouth","story":"In this extract from Kings of the Yukon, a winner in the 2019 Stanford Travel Writing Awards,  Adam Weymouth ‘sheds the city’ for the stillness of natureI leave Teslin after three days. It is early June. Out on Teslin Lake it is hot, too hot to paddle, too hot to think. I float and drift and loaf. A loon is out there somewhere, warbling through its crazy cries. I sing dumb songs. I scare the ducks for something to do, like a small boy. Trucks rumble far off, out along the highway. All along the shore are the remains of families’ fishing camps, old bits of metal glinting in the sun. Through binoculars, I watch two kids on a quad-bike scrounging one for firewood. I watch my paddle, the line and vortex of each stroke drifting away behind me like footprints across the water. I stop and swim and carry on, I stop and swim and camp. One evening I catch a grayling, and fry it up beside potatoes in my skillet on the fire. The sun turns circles in the sky overhead. I have already forgotten darkness.There are always those first few days, I find, until I shed the city where I live, before I feel at ease again. Before muscles feel good, before cracked burnt skin stops hurting and feels like it’s at home. Before my eyes open as wide as they ought. I dip a cup from the side of the boat and drink. Not even from a spring, straight from the lake. It feels astonishing that once all rivers would have run with drinking water, that once I could have dipped my cup into the Thames. And I remember the words of Bill Mason, the Canadian who did more to popularise modern canoeing than anyone else, who made it a rule not to paddle on water that he wouldn’t also drink.The Yukon River and its tributaries comprise the longest salmon run in the world. The king salmon that travel furthest swim 2,000 miles against the current to reach the spawning grounds of their birth, navigating, it is now believed, by their sense of smell. I was on a four-month journey, paddling downriver at the same time as the salmon were swimming up it, to explore the reasons for the king salmon’s sudden, massive decline, and to see how that decline was impacting on the many people, and on the ecosystems, that depend on it.It is two days to the western end of Teslin Lake, where, beneath a bridge, it becomes the Teslin River. There is a diner here, and I stop for eggs benedict and coffee. As I get back on the water the weather shifts, I can pinpoint the very moment. The wind swings round to blow from out the north, gusting blackly across the water. The pressure drops out of the air like a stone, the clouds pile up, and then, for some days, it rains.The Teslin River moves quickly once it strikes out from the lake. The river’s speed is shown in its reflections, a rushing lacework of mirrored clouds, 10 miles an hour, 12. The surface roils like cauldrons. Beavers rise beside the boat and, startled by my presence, slap their tails and duck beneath again. I slap my paddle back at them, the biggest beaver on the river.The offshoots from the main stem are like a primer of northern words: Log Cabin Slough, Muskrat Creek, Little Salmon River, Fish Hook Bend, Mosquito Gulch. Many other places on my map are named for the first white men who settled here, and speak to the erse provenance of the prospectors who came into the country: McGregor Creek, Von Wilczek Creek, O’Brien’s Slough, Johnson’s Crossing, Erickson’s Woodyard.I stop one night on the beach at Mason Landing. In the woods back from the river, out of the rain, there are a cluster of collapsing cabins, built a century ago, following the discovery of gold on Livingstone Creek. Mason Landing would have been the quickest way in: a float down the Yukon River from Whitehorse to its confluence with the Teslin, poling the boat upriver to here, and then a tramp through the bush to Livingstone. Once there was a roadhouse and a stable here, a small trading post and a telegraph station. The police delivered the mail from Whitehorse twice a week. That is to say, in 1902, it was significantly easier to make contact with the outside world than it would be for me to do today. My quickest way to get a message out would be by paddling to Carmacks, about four days away.The buildings are fading back into the landscape now, overgrown with wild rose, sagging beams and fallen timbers. They look less manmade, more a peculiar constellation of natural elements. The roof of one is so thick with moss that it looks no different to the forest floor, and a 30ft-high spruce projects from it. On tin beaten into flues and back plates for the wood stoves, thick with rust, I can still make out the brand names of the products they once held.All down the river are remnants from a time when the Yukon thronged with human life. Old gold-mining paraphernalia the remains of roadhouses every 20 or so miles that were the stop- off points for travellers, rhubarb and raspberries still growing in their gardens mooring rings drilled into rock. On Shipyard Island, the steamer Evelyn is rotting where she stands. Finding it among the trees is like coming upon some ancient Inca temple: 130ft long, as tall as the spruce, with accommodation for 85 first-class passengers. Her hull splintered, the floorboards fallen through, the names of lovers scratched into her boiler. I walk along the upper decks, peering into cabins.It is at Shipyard Island, two weeks into the journey, that I finally join what is, by common consensus, the main stem of the Yukon River. Flowing from Whitehorse, it is swimming-pool blue, so clear one can see fish, but here the Teslin muddies it, and until it meets the ocean it will not run clear again. “Yukon” is a contraction of the Gwich’in phrase chųų gąįį han, which translates as “river of white water”. It is a milky, soupy brown. The silt, rubbed from distant mountains, whispers at the hull, and if you dip your paddle and hold your ear to the shaft you can hear it clearer still, as though the river is deflating. Each new tributary, many of which are big rivers in their own right, adds to the load of silt, so much so that by the time I have passed the eponymous White River it runs so murky that you cannot see deeper than a single knuckle beneath the surface.The high-cut banks give way to basalt cliffs, their lower slopes thick with juniper and the vivid pinks of fireweed, now pushing out their first flowers. Fireweed is known as summer’s hourglass here, for the creep of blossom up its stem can be read as a gauge to the proximity of winter, so that even now, in the endless light of early summer, there is the foreshadowing of its end. And the river widens, too at points it is maybe half a mile from one bank to the other.Gaudíesque hoodoos, wind and weather carved, loom high above the river, hazed by ravens calling madly. One afternoon I see a wolverine, swimming crosswise to the current, like a piece of drift with a mind of its own. It climbs out of the river and shakes itself before it sees me, and darts into the scrub. A wolverine! When my grandparents moved into the house they live in now, they found a walk-in store cupboard covered with scratch marks on the inside, as though some beast had been kept in there. From then on it was known as the Wolverine Cupboard, although as a boy I heard it as “wolvering”, a verb. What sort of terrible creature could have wolvered this cupboard, I wondered. It has forever been an animal mythic in my imagination. And no less mythic for now having seen one.Finally the weather clears and falls into a pattern of hot mornings and a slow build-up of cumuli that become distant storms by the late afternoon. Off, over the mountains, I watch the lightning and one evening – perhaps an hour or so after a storm – a pall comes down over the river. The air smells of wood, like new planks on a hot day, and the river assumes an air of total stillness. Everything beyond the closest bluff is misted blue, receding lighter to the mountains, pale against an even paler sky. The smell of smoke comes stronger and catches in my throat. Then the day takes on a shade of sepia, shot through by the low sun, the exact same colour as the water, and I float through it as though through a dream.Later, in this murk, I hear music. I can see neither bank and cannot place where it is coming from. It is ethereal, far off, as though Sirens are calling to me. Eventually, I convince myself that it is the engines of the planes that are bringing water for the fire. But still, as I drift through this dimensionless space, they seem to harmonise within me, and come from every place at once.An edited extract from Kings of the Yukon: An Alaskan River Journey (Particular Books, £16.99).

As the background to the controversy both here and in Iran is filled in, the short episodes and matey presenting style of Chloe Hadjimatheou and Mobeen Azhar threaten to cheapen a complex issue. But they don’t, quite, and among many knotty talking points is the idea that here was the birth of modern Islamophobia. Jack SealeIn December 2017,  Australia launched The Reckoning, an excellent yet harrowing exploration of Australia’s unprecedented royal commission on institutional responses to child sexual abuse. The three-part investigation, voiced by journalist David Marr, took us on a journey from the past towards the future of the commission. A future now realised, in part, with the conviction of Cardinal George Pell.Despite reporting being non-existent thanks to a suppression order, Pell’s guilty verdict has led to the order being lifted. Marr has returned with a special episode of The Reckoning that takes us inside Pell’s trial. Offering incredible insight, Melissa Davey – the Melbourne bureau chief who sat in on the trial – brings us the shocking testimony from Pell’s accusers and describes how, despite hiring one of the top defence barristers in the state, he was eventually found guilty of all charges.Chosen by Brenna Daldorph, freelance audio producer (Today in Focus)The resulting series is a delicate collection of snapshots detailing Julie’s exceptional life and final moments.

He urged the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, to meet surviving ex-servicemen in Africa and issue a retrospective apology.“It would be perfectly reasonable to ask the government to acknowledge it and, if they felt inclined, to make an apology,” Dannatt told the . “It is absolutely right to recognise the service of anyone of any colour and indeed nationality that was fighting for the crown in the cause of freedom in the second world war … If there have been abuses relating to their service, then it is absolutely right that they are identified and corrected where possible.”A “modest ex gratia payment”, he said, would add “substance to the otherwise rather empty words” of an apology.Dannatt’s intervention came after a documentary film on al-Jazeera English showed that soldiers drawn from Britain’s east African colonies were paid an end-of-war bonus that was graded according to their rank, length of service and ethnicity. The reward for white soldiers – even those from settler communities in the same African colonies – was around three times greater than that given to black troops. Some Africans were forcibly conscripted while others faced an illegal regime of beatings and public floggings.“That policy seems hugely inequitable and wrong,” added Dannatt, who led the army from 2006 to 2009. “We wouldn’t do that today, you would never get away with it today. It would be outrageous today.”The revelations of systematic discrimination have already prompted three shadow secretaries of state to demand that their opposite numbers in government launch an inquiry, make a formal apology and pay compensation. Last week, Labour’s Fabian Hamilton, the shadow minister for peace and disarmament as well as foreign and Commonwealth affairs, raised the matter in parliament, backing calls for redress and challenging defence minister Tobias Ellwood to commit to launching “a full and comprehensive Ministry of Defence investigation”.Ellwood agreed that the issue was “very important” and “something that the secretary of state is also aware of” but incorrectly stated that the Foreign Office was leading on the matter. Foreign Office officials had already confirmed that the Ministry of Defence was taking charge.The Conservative MP – a former captain of the Royal Green Jackets who is now responsible for veterans’ issues and equality in the armed forces – refused to give any more information about possible plans to make amends.Dannatt said that the MoD had to take responsibility for a policy formulated partly by its predecessor, the War Office. “They are the heirs and the successors of the War Office, of course they are,” he said.“I can’t really see why they should be frightened … It’s not going to hurt them politically, it’s not going to hurt the defence budget unduly. It would be seen to be the right thing to do. I would have thought, if I was Gavin Williamson or Tobias Ellwood, the veterans minister, that there is political advantage in doing that. So why not?”Dannatt, who is also president of the military charity Help for Heroes, said the payment of reparations should coincide with a meeting between Williamson and elderly African veterans, adding: “That would be a very helpful thing to do.” Tracking down African veterans eligible for this compensation must be swift, he said, as their advanced age meant “most of them will be dead” if the matter is delayed.The MoD did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/897dba4a8224b9bb9fbd413485adf9722cc8b504/0_129_2808_1685/master/2808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73d69792751e47ef9296ea17f3c21301","title":"explained the case that could bring down canadas justin trudeau","story":"The prime minister is facing his first major scandal, with claims of political pressure to prosecutionsCanada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is facing the biggest political scandal of his administration. The affair centres around allegations that his former attorney general, Jody-Wilson Raybould, was improperly pressured by some of his closest advisers to prevent the prosecution of a large Canadian engineering firm over accusations of fraud and bribery. Thus far, the scandal has been politically costly Gerald Butts, a longtime friend of Trudeau’s, and his closest adviser, resigned two weeks ago. Wilson-Raybould has resigned, too. A handful of polls are showing the scandal is politically unpopular for the governing Liberals – which is worrying for them, given there is a federal election in October.SNC-Lavalin, based in Montreal, is accused of paying C$48m worth of bribes in Libya to Muammar Gaddafi’s family, in order to secure lucrative contracts. The bribery is alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2011. If found guilty, the company would be barred from bidding on federal projects for a decade. SNC-Lavalin employs nearly 50,000 people worldwide, with 3,400 in Quebec.Company executives have been lobbying fora “deferred prosecution agreement”, which in effect allows them to pay a fine in lieu of a criminal prosecution, with no ban on bidding for contracts. But federal prosectors have decided to pursue a trial.This is where the scandal is centred: the prime minister and his aides, along with the finance minister, have been accused of pressing Wilson-Raybould to intervene and asking prosecutors to accept a deferred prosecution agreement. Wilson-Raybould declined to override the judgment of her top legal team.In searing testimony in front of parliament’s justice committee, Wilson-Raybould detailed “consistent and sustained” efforts to change her mind. Despite repeated assertions by Wilson-Raybould that she would not bend, she told a justice committee on Wednesday the pressure intensified – and included “veiled threats” by aides that she was on course for a clash with the prime minister. She said that while it was proper for ministers and their staff to consult her about protecting jobs, it was inappropriate for her to make decisions based on “partisan political considerations”. Her testimony also marked the first public assertion that Trudeau lobbied her – to the point that she felt obliged to warn him what he was asking was improper.Trudeau has not denied that he and his team spoke to Wilson-Raybould and her staff about SNC-Lavalin. He says all of their discussions were respectful and within the bounds of the rules. On Thursday, he reiterated his belief that as prime minister, it is his job and duty to protect the jobs of Canadians – likely a reference to the potential for job losses in the event of a conviction.The leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer, has called on Trudeau to resign –something Trudeau has rejected. Other political leaders have called for more investigations into the affair – and the country’s ethics commissioner is investigating. But at the justice committee hearing on Wednesday, members of Trudeau’s Liberal party appeared as unified there have been no high-profile shows of public support for Wilson-Raybould within the party since Wednesday.On Thursday, Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was on the front page of every major paper in the country, with most running large, dramatic photos of the defiant former attorney general. “I Said ‘No’, My Mind Had Been Made Up,” said the National Post. “Wilson-Raybould Speaks Her Truth,” said the Toronto Star. “Wilson-Raybould points accusing finger at PM,” said the Vancouver Sun. And the Globe and Mail, which broke the story, ran with the headline: “An effort to politically interfere.”A number of figures have requested to testify before the justice committee, including Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former adviser and Michael Wernick, the country’s top public servant. Both were present in many of the discussions – and both have publicly stated previously they did nothing wrong. The prime minister has also said he would consider the future of Wilson-Raybould in the party. While the scandal will likely not damage him in Quebec, where his support of SNC-Lavalin is viewed positively, it could prove damaging in the rest of the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e14d6481a7c15e15f1f73c0c4e5e855de498bb4/0_753_5607_3364/master/5607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c0e1225e3554a669f4dba02eb2244bf","title":"friday briefing labours brexit compromise","story":"MPs could abstain on May’s plan in return for people’s vote … Umunna named TIG spokesman … and, can we orce Michael Jackson’s music from his actions?This is Alison Rourke bringing you the final briefing for the week.Labour is moving towards a compromise plan that would allow Theresa May’s Brexit deal to pass but make clear that parliament “withholds support” until it has been put to a public vote. Those involved in talks said the Labour leadership was in favour of a redrafted amendment proposed by backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, which would see the party abstain on the Brexit deal if a second referendum were promised on those terms. “I have every reason to believe that this will get the necessary support when the time comes,” Kyle said.The amendment is expected to be put to a parliamentary vote on the same day as May tries to get her revised Brexit deal through the House of Commons – before or on 12 March. “This ticks every single box and is the only credible proposal on the table right now,” Kyle said, adding he had spoken to a huge breadth of MPs – from John McDonnell and Keir Starmer to a number of people in May’s own cabinet, as well as more junior ministers – and was confident it could pass.Jared Kushner – Donald Trump ordered his chief of staff to grant his son-in-law a top-secret security clearance, according to reports in the New York Times. It’s alleged senior administration officials were troubled by the decision, which prompted the White House chief of staff at the time, John Kelly, to write an internal memo about it. The White House counsel at the time, Don McGahn, recommended against granting the clearance. The paper said the memos contradicted a statement made by Trump in an interview with the newspaper in January that he had no role in Kushner’s receiving his clearance. Meanwhile, the House oversight committee chairman, Elijah Cummings, has said he will seek interviews with Donald Trump’s children and some of his closest allies after public testimony by the president’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen.‘Collective failure’ – Almost 500 Labour supporters of Jeremy Corbyn have signed an open letter apologising to the Jewish community for the party’s “collective failure” over tackling antisemitism. It follows MP Chris Williamson’s suspension from the party after appearing to downplay the significance of complaints and saying the party had been “too apologetic” over antisemitism. Meanwhile, Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has been urged to monitor sexual harassment cases in the party. A Labour activist who has waited almost 16 months for her complaint of sexual harassment against an MP to be resolved called Watson to take charge of more abuse complaints.Independent Group – Chuka Umunna has been named spokesman as the breakaway MPs draw up policy responsibilities and roles. The former Labour MP said TIG had no immediate plans to appoint a leader as it was not yet a political party, adding that “all the members of our group have the right to be heard and a responsibility to provide leadership”. Luciana Berger becomes home affairs, health and digital cultures spokesperson, while the former Conservative Heidi Allen will take a welfare, social care and business brief. Anna Soubry, a Conservative defector and former minister, will become Brexit spokeswoman, while Chris Leslie, a longtime ally of Umunna and a former shadow chancellor, will take the economics brief.Nuclear talks – The US and North Korea have offered different accounts of why the summit between them collapsed without a deal. Donald Trump said the deal had broken down because Kim Jong-un wanted complete sanctions relief for dismantling the main nuclear complex at Yongbyon, but the US wanted other nuclear facilities, including covert sites, disabled as well. North Korea disputed this. At an abruptly scheduled midnight press conference in Hanoi, the North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said Pyongyang had only demanded partial sanctions relief in return for closing Yongbyon. He said the US had wasted an opportunity that “may not come again”. In spite of this, North Korean media reported the talks in glowing terms.‘Lost Caravaggio’ – Sellers of a painting that they insist is a lost Caravaggio and worth in excess of £100m have announced it will be sold this summer without a reserve. The large painting of Judith beheading Holofernes was found by accident in a Toulouse attic in 2014. It has been pored over by art history experts and scientifically analysed and a highly convincing case has been made that it is from around 1607 and by Caravaggio. In 2016 the French government placed an export ban on the painting to allow investigations and time for the Louvre to consider whether it should be bought.The party’s handling of cases came under scrutiny again this week as it suspended MP Chris Williamson. The move came after the resignation of Luciana Berger, who claims she was bullied out of the party for being Jewish. ’s Jessica Elgot looks back at two years of controversy, plus Jon Swaine on Michael Cohen’s explosive testimony against his former boss Donald Trump.His records were woven into the lives of millions – but the Leaving Neverland documentary appears to make clear the King of Pop was a paedophile.

Having seen only the trailer for Leaving Neverland, he says, “whatever confessional justice was intended by its two informants is compromised by its director’s hackneyed, tabloid true-crime approach. “It doesn’t mean the testimony is untrue, just that it depends on the film-makers selling several racially burdened oxymorons at once: white-male innocence, white-male fragility and white-male truth-telling,” he says.

Photograph: Frank MillerLife expectancy in Ireland and other European countries may be plateauing after decades of continuous improvement, new research indicates.For Irish women in particular, life expectancy has fallen slightly in some years, especially ones with bad flu seasons, the study by the OECD suggests.The economic downturn in Ireland is spared any blame for the slowdown seen in recent years, despite previous research which has shown a link between austerity and deteriorating mental health, and rising suicide rates.The impact of economic downturns on overall death rates is less consistent, according to the OECD research. Europe’s most successful economies, such as Germany, Sweden and The Netherlands, have experienced a greater slowdown in improvements in life expectancy than Ireland and other countries where austerity was most severe, it points out.Diseases of old age are major contributors to the slowdown, it says. Improvements in heart disease have slowed in many countries, while pneumonia and the flu have claimed excess lives in some winters, and deaths from dementia and Alzheimer’s are rising.In addition, rising drug deaths in some countries, notably the United States\u0026nbspand the UK, have slowed and even reversed decades of improvements in death rates among adults.Obesity and diabetesOther factors considered in the report are rising obesity and diabetes – despite reduced smoking, alcohol, high blood pressure and cholesterol levels – and inequality.Life expectancy in Ireland is still rising, as this country continues to catch up on our European neighbours. For men aged 65, it grew 1.3 years in 2006-2011, and by 0.7 years in 2011-2016 for women, the increases were one year and 0.2 years, respectively.However, in 2014-2015, Irish men recorded no increase in life expectancy, while for women it fell by 0.1 years.This mirrored a trend across Europe in 2015, widely attributed to a flu outbreak that hit older people hardest.The slowdown in improvements in life expectancy since 2011 has been greatest in the US, where life expectancy has fallen in recent years, and the UK, but France, Germany, Sweden and The Netherlands have also seen a sharp slowdown.Looking ahead, the study says it is unclear whether the current slowdown is a long-term trend or not, and whether the excess deaths seen in some winters become a regular feature given the ageing of the population.According to the Central Statistics Office, the most recent figures for life expectancy at birth are 78.4 years for men and 82.8 years for women."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3810225.1551388247!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup calls for answers as ni fishing boats detained by irish navy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTwo Northern Ireland registered vessels fishing boats seized by the Irish Navy moored in the port of Clogherhead in Co Louth. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe impounding of two Northern Ireland fishing boats by the Irish Navy has been condemned as “quite outrageous” by the DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds.The boats, the Amity and the Boy Joseph, were detained in Dundalk Bay on Wednesday for allegedly breaching fishing regulations. They were fishing for crabs, lobsters and whelks when they were arrested.In a statement, the Department of Defence said the ships were detained for illegal fishing within the exclusive fishery limits of the State and for illegal entry into the limits. The two boats were escorted to Clogherhead in Co Louth by a fisheries protection vessel and handed over to gardaí.Northern Irish boats are currently prohibited from fishing inside the Republic of Ireland’s territorial limit while vessels from the Republic can fish in Northern Ireland waters. Up until 2016, under the “Voisinage agreement” dating back to the 1960s, there was a “gentleman’s agreement” where fishing vessels from both sides of the Border enjoyed reciprocal rights in Irish territorial waters.However, the deal broke down following a successful legal challenge to the agreement in the Supreme Court in Dublin in 2016. The court ruled Voisinage was an informal agreement of insufficient legal standing to formally grant access to foreign-registered boats. That decision effectively banned Northern Ireland boats from fishing in Irish inshore waters . The UK has continued to recognise the Voisinage agreement so Irish vessels remain free to fish inshore waters around Northern Ireland. The Government in Dublin had pledged to introduce legislation to give legal effect to Voisinage but has not two years on. Mr Dodds, who demanded an explanation from the Taoiseach over the incident, said: “When Leo Varadkar talked about soldiers on the Border he didn’t mention the Irish sending warships with 76mm guns”. “These heavy-handed tactics with our fishing vessels demonstrate that Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney are entirely focused on Ireland and are fair weather friends to Northern Ireland,” he said. The matter was raised in Westminster by Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, who said the detention had happened “without a huge amount of justification”. DUP MP for Strangford Jim Shannon said the boats clearly were British fishing vessels. “They were illegally seized in waters that are disputed, waters that belong to this great nation,” he said.Trawlermen representatives in Northern Ireland declined to comment on the arrests until the outcome of court hearings in Dublin, which they expected to take place on Friday.Security sources said that UK-registered vessels, including those from the North, had previously been intercepted in a similar way, with one such incident occurring last year. The sources added that “sensitivities” related to Brexit had contributed to the level of publicity around the latest incident. Some fishing sources in Northern Ireland said they suspected that Dublin was hoping to use the issue as a bargaining tool in any post Brexit fishing negotiations. “There was a feeling that the Irish might use the court ruling as part of its negotiations over access arrangements to UK waters after Brexit,” said one.Henry Reilly, an independent councillor for Newry, Mourne and Down, said he knew the boats’ owners, who had since returned home to Kilkeel, Co Down. Fianna Fáil has dismissed as “ludicrous” claims that the move was linked to the ongoing Brexit negotiations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3810324.1551384136!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"local radio layoffs continue to loom for real life alan partridges","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge: Dozens of presenters on commercial local radio stations  are to lose their jobs, with hundreds more at risk. Photograph: Andy SeymourBBCPALike most British television comedy, This Time with Alan Partridge is anything but funny, it is\u0026nbspa weary half-hour of obvious, laboured and inevitable gags. This didn’t prevent its first episode from winning an audience of more than three million and five-star reviews from critics, enraptured by what one described as Steve Coogan’s “tortured monster of insecurity and discontent”.Coogan’s creation occupies a special place in the hierarchy of humour in Britain, a country where people will still recite Monty Python’s Dead Parrot sketch almost 50 years after it was first aired. Classic television comedy like Alan Partridge and Fawlty Towers can generate in Britain, more than anywhere else, what Emile Durkheim described as “collective effervescence”, an exalted sense of shared identity.In the new series, Partridge has a job as\u0026nbspa presenter on a dismal local radio station but is standing in for the co-presenter on a parody of BBC’s The One Show. Coogan said Brexit made it feel right to bring back Partridge, whose prejudices are just what London audiences associate with those who voted Leave in 2016.The series opened the same week as Britain’s real-life Partridges, presenters on commercial local radio stations, heard that dozens are about to lose their jobs with hundreds more at risk. Global Radio announced that it would replace more than 40 local breakfast shows on its Capital, Smooth and Heart networks with just three national programmes broadcast from London.Local newsRadio Today estimates that more than 95 presenters will lose their jobs, along with journalists,\u0026nbspengineers and other staff. Global is closing 10 of its 24 local radio studios in Brighton, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Exeter, Gloucester, Kendal, Kent, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon.“The loss of more than 100 local radio jobs across the country is a travesty and particularly damaging at a time when local news is already under extreme pressure,” Labour’s shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said.“Replacing local voices with London-based presenters will be a terrible loss to communities across the country. Radio has unique reach, providing listeners with national and local news and friendly company. This announcement is a terrible blow.”Global’s decision follows new guidance from Ofcom (the broadcasting regulator) last October, reducing the weekday requirement of locally made programming from seven hours to three and removing the obligation to include breakfast in those hours.Radio Today estimates that if Global and its main rival Bauer take full advantage of the new guidelines, the number of local radio presenters could fall by more than 250 with up to 70 per cent of Global’s presenters losing their jobs.Licence areaEarlier regulatory changes made it easier for stations to merge, with one serving an area that might previously have been covered by three. Ofcom’s guidelines allow commercial radio stations to introduce “hubbing” of newsrooms so that journalists no longer have to be based in the licence area. Stations that choose to network all but three hours of output each day must provide an “enhanced news service” during those three hours.“The enhanced local news option gives stations the flexibility to reduce the number of local hours produced, should they wish to make associated cost savings. The provision of local news bulletins during daytime, as well as peak-time, helps to ensure that the station’s local content and identity is maintained during these daytime networked hours,” the guidelines say.Ofcom insists that local bulletins “should not be merely tokenistic box-ticking exercises”, but there is no minimum duration for these bulletins as long as “at least one of the local stories in each bulletin needs to be directly relevant to listeners in each of the licensed areas”.The Press Gazette reported in February a net loss of 245 local newspaper titles in Britain since 2005, with a net loss of 14 in 2018 leading to more than 200 job losses. Many of the local radio studios identified for closure are, like the lost newspapers, in parts of Britain that voted for Brexit.If the referendum was, among other things, a revolt of provincial England against a metropolis that ignored its concerns, the centralisation of local radio programming can only deepen the malaise. And listeners in towns and cities across the country will lose another of their increasingly rare opportunities to experience collective effervescence."},{"url":null,"title":"westminster dog show 2019 pictures","story":"Wire fox terrier wins Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York on Tuesday night, emerging as the top dog among nearly 3,000 barking, tail-wagging competitors.Chairman of the board?

Everyone says Huawei!” the Zhoudan Children’s Singing Classroom croons in the three-minute number.“Teacher tells me to love my country, and to love our domestic brand Huawei! Huawei is good, Huawei is beautiful, Huawei wins glory for our country!“The battery is durable and the appearance is nice. The China-made chip is very precious,” sing the children, in white t-shirts emblazoned with “China.”Huawei has been at the centre of a global spying row after foreign governments including the UK and US began to scrutinise the company, a major supplier in global telecoms infrastructure and expected to be a key player in expanding 5G networks.The lyrics to the hit tune were written by Li Yourong, who was previously in the People’s Liberation Army’s song and dance troupe, and Zang Sijia, who also writes for the national security department.  The video went viral on Weibo, China\u0027s version of Twitter, with some decrying the product placement, and others saying they had been inspired to upgrade their Huawei phone. Huawei has come to symbolise the world’s fear and awe of the might a growing China and its fast-advancing technology industry can exercise globally.While China distinguishes between state-owned and private enterprises on paper, companies are thought to receive implicit state backing if they succeed on the level of a firm like Huawei.In December 2018 Canada arrested a top Huawei executive on an extradition request by the US relating to violating Iran sanctions. That executive, Meng Wanzhou, also the daughter of the company founder, has since been charged by the US.Huawei, Beijing and Chinese state media have repeatedly claimed these allegations are unfair and politically-motivated, accusing the US of trying to restrain Huawei’s global rise. The row has been intensified by an ongoing trade war between the US and China.The plot to bring down Huawei and sever its \u0026#039deeply disturbing\u0026#039 ties to the UKHuawei, which appears to have no part in the song, has responded to the controversy by engaging in a public relations blitz.Earlier this year, schools in Henan province found themselves at the centre of a row when students were told to watch a video about Huawei phones.The pupils were then asked to answer questions including: “What is Huawei’s competitive advantage? A. quality. B. design. C. functionality.” Gao Wuqiang, a regional education official, told Chinese media: “Teaching materials have remained unchanged for years and students got bored... Students’ parents all use Huawei mobiles. I hope the exam could be closer to students’ lives.”Leaving Neverland: everything we know about the new Michael Jackson documentary on Channel 4Brexit latest news: Dominic Raab joins senior Brexiteers in softening backstop positionLeaving Neverland: everything we know about the new Michael Jackson documentary on Channel 4John Michie says daughter\u0026#39s life \u0026#39cruelly cut short\u0026#39 by rapper boyfriend who is jailed for eight-and-a-half yearsNational Offer Day: Record numbers to miss out on first choice for secondary school places UK weather: Storm Freya to batter Britain with 80mph winds St David\u0026#39s Day 2019: Welsh traditions, medieval miracles and how leeks became iconic symbolsEast Europeans quit UK as EU migration hits 10-year lowBritain needs to leave the customs union and single market, say CommunistsComment: From Glasto litterbugs to anti-vaxxers, the right-on brigade are the most irresponsible of allNorth Korea denies Trump’s claim that it demanded all sanctions be liftedUS offers $1 million reward to find Osama bin Laden\u0026#39s sonDefence base closures abandoned after \u0026#39clear eyed assessment of the rapidly changing threats\u0026#39Instagram sees trebling in child grooming offences by paedophiles, police figures showChris Grayling reforms slated for failing to reduce reoffending and \u0026#39skyrocketing\u0026#39 prison returnsComment: We desperately need to be honest about the links between race and gang violenceMP who threatened journalist over son\u0026#39s drug conviction signs Hacked Off letter calling for less  press hatred In the Line of Fire with Ross Kemp,  review: Kemp\u0026#39s mission needed more danger, but our police don\u0026#39tThe Parkinson’s Drug Trial: a Miracle Cure?

It is not due to plateau for another three or four years.Increasing numbers are choosing to lodge appeals against their offers, crippling stretched local authorities and heaping work on academy chains.In 2013, some 20,000 appeals were lodged, a figure expected to reach 40,000 this year as the proportion missing out continue to rise.The majority of those appeals are heard, with an average success rate of around 25 per cent.Bernadette John, director of The Good Schools Guide, warned parents that the worst thing” they could do was to reject an offer “no matter how unwelcome”.She said: “It has been known for a long time that secondary schools would need to accommodate increased pupil numbers but little action seems to have been taken.“For the next few years, it will get worse. Some parts of the country simply do not have enough places to satisfy local demand and elsewhere, many underperforming schools are rejected by families, resulting in the desperate rush as parents put their hopes in the good local school which, of course, is hugely oversubscribed.”She added: “The worst thing parents can do is to immediately reject the school offered, no matter how unwelcome. They need to hold this place while they research their options, which might include appealing to preferred schools or applying to other schools.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said there was “intense pressure” on secondary school places in some areas of the country for schools rated good or outstanding by Ofsted.This situation will become more challenging because the number of pupils in secondary schools is rising and is expected to increase by 428,000 over the next seven years,” he warned.It is vital that additional places are carefully planned at a regional level to match demographic need, and that everything possible is done to ensure every child can access a place in a good school, not least by improving the totally inadequate level of funding currently provided to schools by the government.Last year, one in six children missed out on their chosen secondary place, with the proportion rising for the fifth year in a row.The Department for Education said more than 825,000 school places had been created since 2010.Leaving Neverland: everything we know about the new Michael Jackson documentary on Channel 4Brexit latest news: Dominic Raab joins senior Brexiteers in softening backstop positionLeaving Neverland: everything we know about the new Michael Jackson documentary on Channel 4John Michie says daughter\u0026#39s life \u0026#39cruelly cut short\u0026#39 by rapper boyfriend who is jailed for eight-and-a-half yearsUK weather: Storm Freya to batter Britain with 80mph winds St David\u0026#39s Day 2019: Welsh traditions, medieval miracles and how leeks became iconic symbolsEast Europeans quit UK as EU migration hits 10-year lowBritain needs to leave the customs union and single market, say CommunistsComment: From Glasto litterbugs to anti-vaxxers, the right-on brigade are the most irresponsible of allNorth Korea denies Trump’s claim that it demanded all sanctions be liftedUS offers $1 million reward to find Osama bin Laden\u0026#39s sonDefence base closures abandoned after \u0026#39clear eyed assessment of the rapidly changing threats\u0026#39Instagram sees trebling in child grooming offences by paedophiles, police figures showChris Grayling reforms slated for failing to reduce reoffending and \u0026#39skyrocketing\u0026#39 prison returnsComment: We desperately need to be honest about the links between race and gang violenceMP who threatened journalist over son\u0026#39s drug conviction signs Hacked Off letter calling for less  press hatred In the Line of Fire with Ross Kemp,  review: Kemp\u0026#39s mission needed more danger, but our police don\u0026#39tThe Parkinson’s Drug Trial: a Miracle Cure?

The second was female and named Bronagh and hit Britain a day later, lasting until September 21. The system follows the alternating malefemale pattern established by the US National Hurricane Center in the 1970s.Storm Callum and Storm Deirdre have both come and gone before the new year, Storm Erik was 2019\u0027s first on February 8 and 9 and now Storm Freya is the year\u0027s second. Here are the rest of the storm names for this season:Storm names for 201819Announcing the storm names back in September, Evelyn Cusack, head of forecasting at Met Éireann, said: The last 12 months have seen some extreme weather around the Globe as well as here at home.While it is too early to say whether the coming winter will be a stormy one or a quiet one we are prepared with a whole new set of 21 names for whatever nature may throw at us.As before, Met Éireann forecasters will work in close co-operation with our colleagues from the  Met Office in the UK to keep all the peoples of these islands warned of impending severe weather.This season’s names have once again been compiled from a list of suggestions submitted by the public, choosing some of the most popular names but also selecting names that reflect the nations, culture and ersity of Britain and Ireland. As in previous years, Q, U, X, Y and Z will not be used, to comply with the international storm naming conventions.A storm will be named on the basis of \u0027medium\u0027 or \u0027high\u0027 potential impacts from wind but also include the potential impacts of rain and snow.So storms will be named for weather systems which is expected to result in the Met Office issuing an amber or red warning. These two warnings carry a potential risk to life. There\u0027s nothing British people enjoy more than talking about the weather and in 2015, they were given the chance to develop an even closer connection by giving names to major weather systems affecting the UK and Ireland.In September 2016, the Met Office invited members of the public to submit names for storms for autumnwinter 201516 by social media.The idea behind the pilot project was to help raise awareness of severe weather before it strikes and to ensure greater safety of the public.Attaching a name to a weather event has been found to help people track its progress, to allow people to prepare for and avoid danger and to make it easier to reference on social media.Didn\u0027t we already give names to storms?Before the new system was introduced, naming was random, with the same storm sometimes being referred to by several different names.The St Jude\u0027s Storm of October 2013, which led to the deaths of four people, was so-called because it was due to arrive on St Jude\u0027s Day.In Britain, we also hear about a number of ex-hurricanes that arrive at our shores from across the Atlantic.Since 1953, Atlantic tropical storms have been named from lists originated by the National Hurricane Center. These lists are maintained and updated every year by the international committee of the World Meteorological Organization. There are six lists that are used in rotation.As with the US system, the new naming system in Britain runs through the alphabet with alternate male and female names.There are no storms that begin with the less common letters Q, U, X, Y or Z.The only time that there is a change in the list is if a storm is particularly deadly or costly, such as Hurricane Katrina, which claimed nearly 2,000 lives in the United States and caused more than £65 billion in damage.If a storm is the remnants of a tropical storm or hurricane that has moved across the Atlantic, the already established method of referring to it as, for example Ex-hurricane X, will continue.On March 9, 2016 there was heavy rainfall across south Wales and southwest England and widespread northwesterly gales.There were gusts of wind up to 70mph and rainfall totals were around 20-30mm.Many were confused as to why the winds were not given the name Storm Katie, the next name on the Met Office list after Storm Jake.Storms are named by the Met Office when medium or high impacts are forecast as a result of high winds.As the weather system on March 9 was expected to have a low impact, it did not meet the criteria for naming a storm and was therefore not named.Leaving Neverland: everything we know about the new Michael Jackson documentary on Channel 4Brexit latest news: Dominic Raab joins senior Brexiteers in softening backstop positionLeaving Neverland: everything we know about the new Michael Jackson documentary on Channel 4John Michie says daughter\u0026#39s life \u0026#39cruelly cut short\u0026#39 by rapper boyfriend who is jailed for eight-and-a-half yearsNational Offer Day: Record numbers to miss out on first choice for secondary school places St David\u0026#39s Day 2019: Welsh traditions, medieval miracles and how leeks became iconic symbolsEast Europeans quit UK as EU migration hits 10-year lowBritain needs to leave the customs union and single market, say CommunistsComment: From Glasto litterbugs to anti-vaxxers, the right-on brigade are the most irresponsible of allNorth Korea denies Trump’s claim that it demanded all sanctions be liftedUS offers $1 million reward to find Osama bin Laden\u0026#39s sonDefence base closures abandoned after \u0026#39clear eyed assessment of the rapidly changing threats\u0026#39Instagram sees trebling in child grooming offences by paedophiles, police figures showChris Grayling reforms slated for failing to reduce reoffending and \u0026#39skyrocketing\u0026#39 prison returnsComment: We desperately need to be honest about the links between race and gang violenceMP who threatened journalist over son\u0026#39s drug conviction signs Hacked Off letter calling for less  press hatred In the Line of Fire with Ross Kemp,  review: Kemp\u0026#39s mission needed more danger, but our police don\u0026#39tThe Parkinson’s Drug Trial: a Miracle Cure? review: possibly the most powerful documentary you will see this year\u0026#39Star chamber\u0026#39 of Brexiteers: the Eurosceptic legal group that holds the PM\u0026#39s fate in their handsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/28/14/ba-disruption-16.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-5499316  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/28/14/ba-disruption-16.jpg","title":"ba profits british airways iberia sale iag","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) posted a 6.7 per cent increase in revenue, from €22.9bn (£19.6bn) to €24.4bn, while pre-tax profit increased by 11.2 per cent, rising from €2bn to €2.9bn.The company said the improved numbers came in spite of a jump in fuel costs, which were up 30 per cent over the year. IAG was also hit by a net foreign exchange impact of €129m in 2018. The group said it was continuing to “evaluate and prepare for the potential changes following the UK’s decision to leave the EU”.“As we move into 2019, there is continued political uncertainty, fuel-price volatility and the ongoing risk of impact to our operations and reputation as the frequency, nature and sophistication of cyberattacks increases,” IAG said.Created with Sketch.

If you go back a year, people were saying, ‘will we be able to fly at all?’ I dismissed all of that and I think I’ve been proven correct.”Earlier this month, IAG placed a limit on non-EU shareholders, but said UK residents would be treated in the same way as those from the EU even after Brexit.Mr Walsh said: “This is nothing to do with Brexit. It’s actually been in our articles since we created IAG back in 2011. It was in all of the merger documentation that we issued to shareholders and was approved by shareholders.”Shares in IAG rose 2.4 per cent in early trading.We’ll tell you what’s true.

There are concerns that a hard Brexit could lead to long delays and disruption, with potential for prices to jump and shortages of certain foods. \u0026nbsp“Consumers may see some changes in what is available every week through the year with more space for offers where retailers can respond quickly to opportunities and deliver surprise,” researchers warned.Meanwhile, while retailers have traditionally had very strong rules related to the size, shape and colour of fresh produce items many companies are now changing these rules.“As Brexit draws near, retailers will be rejecting less than ever. Ultimately, this means many shoppers will need to spend extra time learning how to pick their own,” Kantar said. Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.“Overall, this may help retailers accelerate the war on packaging and plastics, on food waste, and on obesity. The only downside is that shopping will take just a little bit longer than before.”Ray Gaul and Fraser McKevitt, who wrote the report, said: “The decision to leave the EU has affected consumers in different ways, but it’s apparent that ongoing uncertainty is already having a definite impact on purchasing trends and behaviours. From a supplier’s perspective, there is little doubt amongst retailers, producers and farmers that Brexit will result in a significant disruption to the UK’s food supply, including unharvested produce and empty supermarket shelves.”British shoppers have also begun to display “several recessionary behaviours” in the run-up to Brexit, according to the research. Consumers are beginning to follow buying patterns last observed during the post-financial crisis recession: the long-term trend of choosing foods for health reasons has “plateaued”, while the number of lunch boxes taken to work by adults has risen. Overall out-of-home food and drink growth has also slowed, reversing the boom of recent years.

He tells Andy Martin how he worked his way back to successClick to followThe IndependentBack in 2007, Queen Elizabeth II was shown, in a short clip, seemingly stomping out of a photoshoot with Annie Leibovitz, muttering under her breath, clearly bad-tempered, having taken offence at the suggestion she should take her crown off. Not scandalous, surely? No, but it was an early example of fake news. In fact, the Queen had arrived in a bit of a mood\u0026nbspbut had also enjoyed the shoot, and only unfortunate editing\u0026nbspturned it around and made more of a drama out of it. The tabloids then piled in and talked of betrayal or treason, calling for heads to roll.\u0026nbspOne of the heads belonged to David Frank, then chief executive of RDF Television, now cofounder and executive chairman of TRX (or The RightsXchange), an online marketplace for television.His head is still on his shoulders. He didn’t end up in the Tower of London. “It was a perfect storm of misfortune,” he recalls, sitting in a boardroom in Somerset House, a stone’s throw from the Thames. “Just an amazing cockup.” There was an out-of-the-blue phone call from the BBC\u0026nbspasking\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspthey had\u0026nbspany material that could be included in a showreel for their forthcoming documentary series, The Royal Family at Work. An editor noticed\u0026nbspthey had a tape – thrown together by way of a pitch to other TV companies elsewhere in Europe. It wasn’t supposed to be shown on television at all. But the helpful editor, unbeknownst to higher powers, had it couriered over to the BBC and the offending item duly appeared on the Nine O’clock News.Then, as Frank recalls:\u0026nbsp“The shit really hit the fan.” Apologies and resignations (including the controller of the BBC and RDF’s creative director) all round. “The BBC and ITV suspended operations with us, pending inquiries. Our share price collapsed. It went from something like 270 pence to 60 pence in a couple of months.” It was the worst crisis Frank had ever experienced. “We became the story.”\u0026nbspThe royal to do\u0026nbspbecame known as Queengate, or Crowngate.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II: Life in pictures  Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II on a walk-about in Portsmouth during her Silver Jubilee tour of Great Britain, 1977The future Britain\u0027s Queen Elizabeth II (R) pictured with her younger sister Princess Margaret (L) in 1933The 9-year-old Elizabeth attends an aristocratic wedding with her mother and younger sister.

It’s not that complicated, telly – no more than journalism.” He was born in Kenya in 1958, studied law at Oxford\u0026nbspand was employed as a lawyer for a grand total of 6 weeks until his exam results came through. Which is when he was fired. “I didn’t really fancy being a lawyer anyway,” Frank says. He went into investment banking\u0026nbspbut soon dropped out and started writing a column for The Independent\u0026nbspabout\u0026nbspcapital markets instead. He had a notion he could do something similar for television and applied for 20 jobs at the BBC but\u0026nbspdidn’t even get interviewed. Then, through a friendly contact, he fluked a job as a presenterinterviewer\u0026nbspdoing news and current affairs segments for a number of news programmes. “I loved all that,” he says. “But the BBC was anything but a meritocracy. You had to wait till somebody died before you could get a better job. There was a feeling of Groundhog Day.”So, begging, borrowing and not quite stealing the finance, he set himself up as an independent producer, RDF. He sold his first programme, to Channel 4 in 1993, about\u0026nbspindustrial espionage. “It wasn’t a very good programme, to be honest,” he says. “We had a small amount of footage and a lot of conspiracy theorists.” His younger brother Matthew, then a radio journalist, joined him on the sales side. They ended up making some classic series, such as Scrapheap Challenge\u0026nbsp(guys racing to put weird machines together out of junk). Their “human interest” stories (“mainly royals or mad\u0026nbspeccentric Brits”) sold around the world, notably anything to do with Princess Diana, pre- or post-car crash.But it was the Communications Act of 2003 that was the real gamechanger. The new legislation meant\u0026nbspterrestrial broadcasters would no longer own the programmes they commissioned, and the independents were free to sell their wares again and again. RDF already had its own sales house and became the outlet for 40 or so other independent programme-makers, selling rights on their behalf. They floated in 2005, with a turnover of some £40m, then hit the royal buffers in 2007. When RDF was sold to Zodiac, Frank moved over to become CEO of Zodiac. But he eventually resigned to set up TRX with his brother, a “next generation” company, in 2015. They have only a small and select staff. Their mantra is “More Deals, Less Hassle”. \u0026nbspDavid Frank radiates an almost zen-like calm and confidence and can laugh about past dramas. He and his brother Matthew are still best friends and go to watch Arsenal games together. They live within a few hundred yards of one another in Putney and avoid traffic jams by taking the Thames river bus every day to the Embankment and walking to Somerset House. TRX aims to make global TV transactions just as smooth and relaxing.A View From The Top: Kaidi Ruusalepp, founder of FunderbeamA View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityA View From the Top: Peter Simpson of Anglian WaterA View from the Top with Zia Yusuf, CEO of concierge service VelocityThe number of broadcasters has increased exponentially in the last 20 years. So has the number of programme-makers. TRX offers to put them all together, online, to provide a cloud-based platform for buying and selling rights. “If we’re successful, this could be worth billions,” says Frank. “I’m not that motivated by money, but the valuation of a company is a validation of what you do.” Frank doesn’t miss making programmes. “The nature of ‘creatives’ is that they’re difficult people to work with,” he says. “They’re short on compromise. That’s their strength. But managing them is hard work. I don’t have to do that here. Now we’re making technology, not programmes. It’s different, but I’m having more fun than ever. And it’s a lot better than Queengate.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Although it made a loss overall, it\u0027s possible to see some green shoots peering through the hard ground\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentThe Co-operative Bank is much diminished, but has reported an operating profit for the first time in yearsGiven its travails, the natural reaction of many to a set of results from the Co-operative Bank would be to say ‘what, it’s still here?’Yes it is. It’s a lot smaller, with just 68 branches, down from over 300, and the Co-operative Group no longer has any shareholding in it. Ownership is mostly in the hands of hedge funds after it almost went under.\u0026nbspBut despite it all, the Co-op Bank in still trading, has stuck to its ethical creed and today reported a significant achievement. Last year it made money. Sort of.\u0026nbspCo-op Bank returns to profit for first time in five yearsDisgraced ex-Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers banned from CityCo-op Bank gets approval for £700m rescue deal The business recorded an operating profit of just under £15m in 2018, compared with a loss of £84m the previous year. That represents the first such profit in half a decade.\u0026nbspBut the key word is “operating”. Chuck in everything else - one off costs, investments etc - and the\u0026nbsp bank still spent the year in the red overall, recording a pre tax loss of just under £141m, similar to the number posted in 2017.\u0026nbspThat’s where the challenge comes in.\u0026nbspThe bank is likely to remain under water for some time at the headline level. CEO Andrew Bester, the latest in through what has been something of a revolving door at the top, has been notably vague about when that might change, talking only about being back in black at the conclusion of a five year transformation programme.\u0026nbspFaced with operating in an economy beset with uncertainty thanks to Britain’s dismal government, the business is far from out of the woods.\u0026nbspBut it is just possible to see some green shoots peeping through the hard ground.\u0026nbspIn addition to that all important operating profit, mortgage completions were at their highest level since 2010. The net interest margin - the difference between what borrowers pay and depositors are paid - was above 2 per cent. Business areas the bank had pulled out of are now being looked at again. As application is in for the second tranche of funding RBS has had to put up for small business banks as a consequence of its enormous bailout.\u0026nbspCEO Andrew Bester, a veteran of Lloyds and Standard Chartered, can point to things happening.The Co-operative Bank is a very different organisation to what he’s been used to.\u0026nbspHe’s gone from being part of the team running an ocean liner to skippering a sailing dinghy.\u0026nbspThe business he runs is small and niche and always will be. But despite all that it has been through, the brand, and its stance, are still attractive to a certain kind of organisation, those for which profit isn’t the prime motivation. It is also still attractive to a certain kind of person. You wouldn’t expect to find Co-op investing in oil sands or other projects that will exacerbate climate change, for example, by contrast to some of Britain’s bigger banks.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) posted a 6.7 per cent increase in revenue, from €22.9bn (£19.6bn) to €24.4bn, while pre-tax profit increased by 11.2 per cent, rising from €2bn to €2.9bn.The company said the improved numbers came in spite of a jump in fuel costs, which were up 30 per cent over the year. IAG was also hit by a net foreign exchange impact of €129m in 2018. The group said it was continuing to “evaluate and prepare for the potential changes following the UK’s decision to leave the EU”.“As we move into 2019, there is continued political uncertainty, fuel-price volatility and the ongoing risk of impact to our operations and reputation as the frequency, nature and sophistication of cyberattacks increases,” IAG said.Created with Sketch.

If you go back a year, people were saying, ‘will we be able to fly at all?’ I dismissed all of that and I think I’ve been proven correct.”Earlier this month, IAG placed a limit on non-EU shareholders, but said UK residents would be treated in the same way as those from the EU even after Brexit.Mr Walsh said: “This is nothing to do with Brexit. It’s actually been in our articles since we created IAG back in 2011.

There are concerns that a hard Brexit could lead to long delays and disruption, with potential for prices to jump and shortages of certain foods. \u0026nbsp“Consumers may see some changes in what is available every week through the year with more space for offers where retailers can respond quickly to opportunities and deliver surprise,” researchers warned.Meanwhile, while retailers have traditionally had very strong rules related to the size, shape and colour of fresh produce items many companies are now changing these rules.“As Brexit draws near, retailers will be rejecting less than ever. Ultimately, this means many shoppers will need to spend extra time learning how to pick their own,” Kantar said. Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.“Overall, this may help retailers accelerate the war on packaging and plastics, on food waste, and on obesity. The only downside is that shopping will take just a little bit longer than before.”Ray Gaul and Fraser McKevitt, who wrote the report, said: “The decision to leave the EU has affected consumers in different ways, but it’s apparent that ongoing uncertainty is already having a definite impact on purchasing trends and behaviours. From a supplier’s perspective, there is little doubt amongst retailers, producers and farmers that Brexit will result in a significant disruption to the UK’s food supply, including unharvested produce and empty supermarket shelves.”British shoppers have also begun to display “several recessionary behaviours” in the run-up to Brexit, according to the research. Consumers are beginning to follow buying patterns last observed during the post-financial crisis recession: the long-term trend of choosing foods for health reasons has “plateaued”, while the number of lunch boxes taken to work by adults has risen. Overall out-of-home food and drink growth has also slowed, reversing the boom of recent years.

Parents were required to list between three and six schools in order of preference on applications submitted in October 2018.Last year 104,000 children, or 17.9 per cent, missed out on their first choice, an increase from 2017.Some 4.1 per cent of pupils were allocated places at schools which were not among their preferences last year, a figure which the Good Schools Guide forecast to rise this year.“For the next few years, it will get worse,” Ms John said.The Local Government Association (LGA) has predicted 134,000 children could miss out on a secondary school place entirely in the next five years as pupil numbers surge.Seventy-one councils in England and Wales\u0026nbspwill unable to meet demand unless ministers give them the power to open schools or force academies to expand, it warned in August.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of NAHT headteachers’ union, said: “Until the government sorts its act out and comes up with a national strategy to guarantee there are enough school places for every child in England, the annual anxious wait for families will always be a problem.“It’s an issue which isn’t going away. There is a desperate need for long-term planning that s all sectors. “Local authorities are responsible for providing sufficient school places but the powers and resources necessary to do so have been removed.”Nick Gibb, minister for schools standards, said: “This government is determined to create more choice for parents when it comes to their children’s education and we have created 825,000 school places since 2010, and are on track to see that number rise to a million by 2020.“Standards have also risen, with 86 per cent of schools now good or outstanding, compared to 68 per cent in 2010.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” So, the initial emphasis will inevitably be on the vast back catalogues of\u0026nbspboth companies, going back to the 1950s. In principle, a viewer might chose to watch every episode of Coronation Street since it was first shown on\u0026nbsp9\u0026nbspDecember\u0026nbsp1960, or the 5,875 episodes of EastEnders made since 1986. Either would make for\u0026nbspquite a binge.\u0026nbspEvery Morse, every Doctor Who (at least the ones where the tapes haven’t been wiped), every Avengers, and every Dad’s Army\u0026nbspevery Morecambe \u0026amp Wise show, every recent hit drama such as The Night Manager or Vera\u0026nbsp– all would be available on demand, for a subscription fee.\u0026nbspIn due course, though, the BBC and ITV hope to\u0026nbspcommission new series especially for BritBox, just as competitors such as Netflix\u0026nbspand Amazon do. How and when these series might find their way onto their conventional channels is unclear. Other things being equal, like many digital content providers in every field, they would have to offer their subscribers something special,\u0026nbspwhich is not available for free elsewhere, to justify the fees.How much will BritBox cost to the viewers?There is speculation that it might be as little as £5 per month, though this has not been confirmed, beyond the BBC and ITV saying it will be “competitive”. As with other streaming services, it might be available direct or via other data providers, such as BT in the UK.In principle, given the BBC’s charter, major licence fee funding might be problematic. ITV have pledged some £65million initially the BBC will not comment\u0026nbspon its financial commitment.Why are the BBC and ITV doing this now?The truth is, they have little choice. Streaming of high quality programming, using the Internet (and or satellite and cable) and bypassing traditional broadcasting methods, have caused massive disruption. Younger viewers, especially, are more likely to use the likes of Netflix, Amazon and YouTube for their video entertainment than they are to\u0026nbspsettle down with a cup of tea and a biscuit in front of Emmerdale or Newsnight. BBC to air rival Leaving Neverland Michael Jackson documentary ITV and the BBC\u0027s BritBox streaming service has potential BBC invites public to take control of its Brexit coverageThis fragmentation of the market is something that conventional broadcasters such as ITV and the BBC have dreaded for years – the moment of “peak television”, beyond which\u0026nbspviewing figures start to decline.The traditional broadcasters are also attracted by the prospect\u0026nbspof establishing a worldwide presence. Netflix, for example, has 56 million users – about the population of the UK. If BritBox can become a global player, then new possibilities for programming open up. Netflix commissions well over 100 new series a year – more than anyone else on the planet. If BritBox succeeds, it will create a virtuous circle where new shows attract new subscribers, and the revenues from their fees and any accompanying advertising is used to commission more shows, which will attract more viewers, and so on.If anything, the move is overdue. The new kids on the block\u0026nbsphave been eroding the BBC and ITV market share for some years. An attempt to create something like BritBox in the UK at the start of the decade was blocked by the competition authorities. They no longer seem inclined to do so.Will it succeed?Well, the BBC and ITV have a superb record when it comes to\u0026nbspcreating hit drama series\u0026nbspin particular, many of which have been popular worldwide. Comedies, documentaries, nature and arts programming might also attract major new audiences through the new platform. The BBC also has a global reputation for impartial and investigative\u0026nbspnews-gathering – an increasingly precious asset in a world of “fake news”.\u0026nbspMassive global hits such as The Crown (Netflix) or Game of Thrones (HBO) could easily have been made by the British broadcasters\u0026nbsp– but they now lack the financial heft to do so. To give one example,\u0026nbspthe budget for each episode of Amazon Prime’s The Grand Tour is about £4.5million for the BBC’s Top Gear it is £500,000. Why Roma’s awards-season success is such a big win for NetflixThe Beeb\u0026nbspand ITV are simply\u0026nbspbeing out-done commercially if not artistically. They are too small and too focused on the UK in what has rapidly become a globalised business.So the talent (Olivia Colman, as a symbol), the creativity and the expertise are all there – London is already a world centre for post-production and the UK has excellent film and studio facilities. What may be lacking is the business acumen that could really make the new service a success. ITV and BBC executives are simply too parochial and inexperienced in this field – as opposed to programme-making and dealing with awkward MPs – and would need to require some potentially expensive (possibly foreign) commercial nous to pilot them to success, just like Premier League football teams.Alternatively, in the longer run, they might consider forming some sort of more cooperative relationship with the\u0026nbspestablished streaming services, though again that would bring its own complications, not least because of the BBC\u0027s status as a state-owned broadcaster with no private shareholders and a unique agenda.Can I watch the very latest episodes of Emmerdale or Endeavour on there?Probably not. The idea is that the most recent and live material will still be broadcast on-line via the BBC’s existing iPlayer and ITV\u0027s Hub service (for all their various channels, including radio in the case of the BBC).What about Brexit?BritBox could be a pioneer of the new “global Britain”, an international player in a fast-developing market concentrating on the kind of value-added creative content that the world will pay good money for. British programming and show formats have traditionally sold well abroad, and this would be a massive extension of that tradition. Early days, but BritBox could be transformational.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself.

HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHSheeran has previously explained that he uses a loop station during his live shows, as opposed to a backing track.A looping pedal enables musicians to record a sound once before it is played over and over again, with the possibility of layering additional sounds to create an entire track.Muse released their latest album,\u0026nbspSimulation Theory, in November 2018.The band just started a world tour in Houston, Texas, on 22 February, and they are set to continue through October 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government itself has spent more than £4.2bn so far\u0026nbspon Brexit preparations, though not all of that has gone towards no-deal planning.For smaller firms the amounts can be significant, but can any of this be recouped by way of compensation if it turns out to have been unnecessary?

If the UK is given “Part 2 listed status”, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. “These would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,” says Eurotunnel.

Not only do they use the flights – so do their families and friendsCurrent European passengers’ rights rules, known as EC2612004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to “extraordinary circumstances”.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.Ultimately, the answer for businesses seems to be no but there is a severe lack of information and clarity on this point.EU net migration drops to 10-year low ahead of BrexitNeither the Department for Exiting the EU nor the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy could point to any government mechanism that would cover unnecessary no-deal costs for small firms.This is something that some small and medium-sized businesses have said they want. In a\u0026nbspsurvey late last year by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), 16 per cent of respondents said they would find a voucher of £2,000 to £3,000 towards\u0026nbspBrexit planning helpful. Another 10 per cent wanted interest-free loans to cover the costs.But three times as many firms simply wanted clear information, kept in a single place, about how they should prepare. Such a one-stop shop still doesn’t exist, leaving businesses in the dark.In the face of such uncertainty, it is understandable to an extent that only one in seven small companies have starting planning for a no-deal Brexit despite the fact that half think it will be harmful to them. Some no doubt are loath to spend money on which they may see no return.Typically of course, firms plan for future risks with insurance, but for a no-deal scenario this presents a problem. As the Association of British Insurers points out, cover is designed for unforeseeable events –\u0026nbspfire, theft, critical illness –\u0026nbspwhich are somewhat different to those posed by a no-deal outcome. Perhaps more beneficial than any insurance policy,\u0026nbsphowever, would be if Brexit didn’t go ahead. The UK has forgone around 2 per cent of predicted economic growth since the June 2016 referendum, while the government’s own analysis forecasts a no-deal departure will chop 9.3 per cent off GDP.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

A\u0026nbsplovespoon is a customary gift weighted with symbolismA tradition dating from the 17th century, a Welsh lovespoon is given by skilled carvers to the objects of their affection to demonstrate prowess in carpentry and\u0026nbspimply\u0026nbspan ability to provide.\u0026nbspLovespoons are commonly decorated with hearts, anchors, horseshoes, knots and locks, with many conveying hidden emotional meaning. A spoon with an entwined stem, for instance, indicates togetherness, while a decorative Welsh dragon at the tip of the handle represents a protective charm.Created with Sketch.

Clock, one of the oldest functioning timepieces in the worldBorn in Caerfai, Pembrokshire, in 500 AD to Prince Ceredig ap Cunedda and Nom, daughter of a Celtic chieftain, St. David was an early Christian missionary and archbishop who travelled to France, Ireland and the Holy Land and founded 12 monasteries.Much of David’s life is shrouded in mystery but he was once believed to be a nephew of King Arthur on his mother\u0027s side and stands today as a symbol of Welsh resistance against the Norman Conquest. He is also recognised as the patron saint of doves.11 best Welsh drinks for St David\u0027s DayMiracles associated with David include the Synod of Llanddewi Brefi\u0026nbsp- where he raised a hill up from the ground so that his followers could better hear a sermon – restoring sight to the blind St. Paulinus and bringing a dead boy back to life with his tears. David also survived a poisoning at the hands of his own monks, who had fed him tainted bread after growing tired of the hard labour and deprivation they had suffered as a result of his extreme brand of asceticism.He died on 1 March in 589 AD and his remains have been interred at St. David\u0027s Cathedral in Pembrokeshire since he was canonised by Pope Callixtus in 1120 (or they were, until King Edward I made off with his head and arm as holy relics in 1284). David\u0027s burial site has been a popular place of pilgrimage for centuries since and his\u0026nbspaphorism “Gwnewch y pethau bychain” -\u0026nbspor “do the little things” -\u0026nbspremains a national motto to this day.The people of Wales celebrate their national day by sporting daffodils about their person and taking part in festivities across the country, with large parades staged in Cardiff, Aberystwyth, Wrexham and Llandudno every year. Children are often dressed in traditional folk attire dating from the 18th and 19th centuries and the national hymn, “Land of our Fathers”, resounds.Traditional Welsh dishes are also served – notably roast lamb or Rarebit – with perhaps the least appetising being raw leeks, customarily presented to Welsh regiments of the British army to devour whole in a nod to their distinctive heritage.\u0026nbspLeeks were said to be worn by Welsh soldiers in battle tied to their helmets – as Fluellen does in Shakespeare’s Henry V - to distinguish themselves from Saxon invaders, although the precise origins of Wales’s association with the root vegetable remain obscure.Aside from daffodils,\u0026nbspDylan Thomas,\u0026nbspTom Jones, the Stereophonics\u0026nbspand Gareth Bale, Wales’s most instantly recognisable symbol is the snarling red dragon emblazoned on its national flag.This icon can be traced back to Arthurian legend and a dream experienced by the young Merlin, later to be Camelot’s court wizard and chief adviser to the king, who foresaw a battle between a red and white dragon and understood it to represent the coming of Arthur to see off the Saxon hordes.\u0026nbspThe myth is recorded in some of Britain’s oldest prose literature, including the Mabinogion and Historia Brittonium but became crystalised in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History of the Kings of Britain in 1136.While St. Andrew’s Day in Scotland and St. Patrick’s Day in Ireland are national holidays, the same isn’t true for their Welsh and English equivalents.This is because former Prime Minister Tony Blair vetoed calls for a change to the law in March 2007, despite\u0026nbspa near-unanimous\u0026nbsp87 per cent\u0026nbspof the Welsh population stating their preference for making St. David’s Day a bank holiday.Some Welsh schools defy the status quo by giving their students a half-day, a move no doubt popular with the pupils.We’ll tell you what’s true.

James Moyer-Lee, IWBG\u0027s general secretary, said on Twitter.\u0026nbspThe changes to the congestion charge were proposed by Mr Khan and TfL to reduce congestion and air pollution in central London.\u0026nbsp“The number of Private Hire Vehicles entering the Congestion Charge zone has shot up from 4,000 a day in 2003 when it first came into operation, to more than 18,000 now, a spokesperson for the mayor of London said.Sadiq simply isn’t prepared to ignore the damaging impact this has on congestion and increasing air pollution.Congestion has a crippling impact on businesses across the capital. At the same time, our toxic air in London is a major public health crisis that is stunting the lung development of our children, leading to thousands of premature deaths and increases the risk of asthma and dementia.“Most other motorists, from private cars to small business owners, are liable for the Congestion Charge. Removing the Congestion Charge exemption for private hire vehicles is a key part of our plans to both reduce congestion and to protect Londoners from harmful emissions from polluting vehicles.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Having attempted to evade capture, he is being portrayed as a hero in India.Abhinandan is expected be returned at the Wagah border crossing between the two countries on Friday afternoon,

But diplomatic relations between the two countries remain strained.Qureshi said he would not attend a meeting of foreign ministers from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Abu Dhabi this weekend, because his Indian counterpart had been invited to the event.Qureshi has said the Saudi foreign minister is set to visit Islamabad with a message from Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who visited both Pakistan and India last month.Abhinandan\u0027s plane came down on Wednesday after a dogfight with a Pakistani jet, two eyewitnesses told Reuters.The pilot shouted pro-India slogans, and after realising he was in enemy territory, attempted to flee, firing his pistol in the air to deter Pakistani villagers who were chasing him, the eyewitnesses said.During that half a kilometre run, he fired some more gunshots in the air as well, to frighten the guys but to no avail, said Muhammad Razzaq Chaudhry, 58, one of the eyewitnesses.Then he jumped into a small stream. Then, he realised that he could not escape, he took out some documents and maps from his uniform and tried to swallow some, tear apart and immerse the rest.Abdul Majeed, 40, said he was one of a number of villagers who had beaten and thrown stones at the pilot.Pakistan will release Indian fighter pilot after Kashmir flare-upModi says India will \u0027fight as one\u0027 in first comments on Kashmir clashWhile in the stream he once again pointed his revolver at us and fearing that he may shoot directly at us, I threw a stone at him, he said.Some of us did thrash him... because he had given us a tough time. But later we handed him over to the army personnel.The conflict comes at a critical time for India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces a general election that must be held by May.Modi is expected to benefit from the nationalist pride unleashed by his government\u0027s announcement on Tuesday that Indian warplanes had destroyed a major training camp of Jaish-e Mohammad, the militant group that claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 attack.But there were growing calls from opposition parties for more information about just how successful the mission was.India\u0027s Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale had said the strike killed a very large number member of the group, and another senior government official told reporters that about 300 militants had been killed, but New Delhi had still to provide evidence to support that assessment.Pakistan says the Indian planes missed whatever they were aiming at, and that no-one died in the attack outside Balakot, , a small town in Pakistan\u0027s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Villagers on the outskirts of Balakot told Reuters one of their neighbours was wounded during the attack, but there were no other casualties and the Indian bombs caused negligible damage, although there was a madrasa run by Jaish nearby.On Thursday, Mamata Banerjee, one of the main leaders of an Indian opposition coalition attempting to unseat Modi, requested more information about the attack.We have the right to know how many people died in the air strike and who were they, she said.We want to know the actual incident as we have not received any details.Amit Shah, the president of Modi\u0027s Bharatiya Janata Party and one of its most influential figures, sought to dispel any doubt.People should decide if they trust India\u0027s armed forces or not, he said at an event on Friday.Those who are doubting are helping Pakistan.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The airspace above major eastern cities like Lahore, near the border with India, will remain closed.\u0026nbspPakistan closed its airspace entirely to commercial flights after an aerial engagement between its air force and India over Kashmir, in which one fighter jet from each country was shot down.The move has caused significant disruption to travellers, with dozens of flights cancelled and flight paths across Asia rerouted to avoid the country.Though some northern Indian airports were briefly closed on Wednesday, India\u0027s airspace has otherwise\u0026nbspremained open throughout the crisis, which began with the deadly bombing of an Indian army convoy on 14 February.India responded to the Valentine\u0027s Day attack by conducting airstrikes\u0026nbspon what it described as a training camp belonging to the Jaish-e-Mohammed\u0026nbspmilitant group. Pakistan-based\u0026nbspJeM had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing in Pulwama, Kashmir, though it was carried out by a young Kashmiri\u0026nbspman.Tensions reached a peak on Wednesday when Pakistan responded by sending its air force to target - though not fire on - Indian military outposts in Kashmir. India scrambled its own jets, leading to the dogfight in which the aircraft were shot down.\u0026nbspThe reopening of airspace was seen as a further seen of reducing tensions, after Pakistan also promised to return a captured Indian fighter pilot on Friday afternoon.And while India has talked down tensions and welcomed the return of the pilot, its government says it reserves the right to repeat strikes on militant targets within Pakistan if it is believed that an attack is imminent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But no longer.In recent months Big Ben has stood silent. Officially, it has been muted for repairs but you could not be blamed for wonderingthere was a dferent reason.Has this most resonant symbol of parliamentary democracy been gagged — had its clacker nicked — while our appalling, promise-shredding, treasonous politicians plot to overturn the  referendum’s whacking vote to leave the European Union Almost three years ago the voters gave MPs a clear instruction: Get us out of the EU. Unbelievably, the MPs are refusing to obey.Whatever tricksy waffle they spout, be in no doubt about this. The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat. But no. He was allowed to keep his job.Things are just as bad in the Labour party, where ­Jeremy Corbyn has casually scrapped his  manesto promise to respect the result of the EU referendum.Now he says he wants a second referendum. You thought the one thing loonytunes Corbyn had going for him was that he said what he believed A manesto should matter. It should be a solemn undertaking to the voters about what politicians will do.But Corbyn, supposed beardie prophet of ethics, now snootily thinks we voted the wrong way in the referendum and must capitulate to the European empire, ditching the national independence .million voters demanded.Why the hell are these people in politicsthey think so little of the voterswho opted for Leave Theirs is the behaviour of a tyrannous clique whose “delay” to our departure helps only their fellow technocrats in the European Commission.And that’s what it’s all about. They feel a greater kinship with their fellow elitists on the Continent than they do with working-class British voters.The likes of Greg Clark and Amber Rudd and their slippery pal Philip Hammond looked smug yesterday when Mrs May announced the possibility of a delay to Brexit.For them, it’s a game, a ploy, a bid to show that they — and not the unwashed electorate — run the show.Can they not see the dangers  Respect for Westminster, already whacked by the expenses scandal, will take another terrible hit. People will look at the wriggling and the grand- standing and the lies and procrastinating blether of the last day and a half and will conclude that our Parliament is now a place that scorns its electors.Some of you may have greater faith.Some of you may say: “Brexit will prevail in the end”, albeit in diluted form.But eventhat is true, what are we to think in future of the House of Commons Things have reached the stage, I am truly sorry to say, that I now find I hate the very sight of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster.It is no longer, for me, the proud cockpit of our national le.It has become a nest of aggressive, desperate elitists prepared to do anything to save their greasy grasp on public opinion.They lie.

But who really believes that MPs will prevent that too, maybe by backing the second referendum Labour now supports. A delay may well be fatal.We are outraged at the Cabinet Remainers and no-mark ministers who held the PM to ransom to secure a vote over halting No Deal. A clearout of this sorry bunch cannot come too soon.But it is plain that they are calling the shots now, not the ERG’s Brexiteers — despite the  claims of  Anna Soubry.All Tory MPs must remember this: Their party can avoid complete destruction — and indeed can capitalise on  Corbyn’s poll collapse — ONLY by  delivering Brexit. Yes, even Mrs May’s version . . . with an improved backstop.No Brexit leads to No Tories — and the collapse of our political system.IT beggars belief. A Labour Party already engulfed by an anti-Semitism crisis backs a violently anti-Semitic terrorist group.This is our official Opposition,  challenging the Home Secretary for more evidence that Hezbollah’s political wing should be banned from Britain.They’re not convinced by its own  deputy leader admitting there’s no dference between its politicians and its military wing, which is already banned.Nor by the catalogue of atrocities Hezbollah has carried out against  civilians, including children, in Syria.Nor by the fact it is dedicated to driving Jews from their homes.Corbyn and his  aide Seumas Milne won’t bend. They are two upper-class idiots who have spent all their pampered lives romanticising left-wing violence.And yet Labour still wants voters to believe it is not racist — and that our nation’s defence is safe in its hands.What a sick joke.WE commend Facebook, for once, for finally pulling the plug on Tommy Robinson.He may pose as a fearless truth-seeker exercising his right to free speech. In reality he is a criminal thug whose page stirred up violence against Muslims.We’d have more time for Facebook, though,they were equally decisive over removing Islamist extremism.Or self-harm videos.And we ask this of Google’s YouTube, where Robinson still has a presence:What exactly are you waiting for Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would be a democratic disaster.Yes, this Government has made a catalogue of errors from triggering Article  with no plan, to letting Brussels decide the sequencing of Brexit talks.But at this stage, with the clock ticking towards midnight, there is no time for “coulda woulda shoulda” about what went wrong when.Sun readers knew all along that in a negotiation there’s always give and take.You can’t get everything you want.And although the Prime Minister’s deal has flaws, it’s actually far better than many critics will admit.Those same critics can also be wildly unrealistic about the actual alternatives on offer now.The most likely alternative is in fact a far softer Brexit, which leaves Britain with less not more control.ImagineDavid Cameron had won from Brussels a deal that took back control of immigration, let us set our rules covering the key services sector, and allowed us to scrap the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.Let’s suppose it gave us control of our fishing waters, let us choose environmental and employment laws as long as we kept to certain general standards, and which got us out of the EU’s political project. He would have been a hero.Yet that is precisely what Theresa May has secured. Even in a worse-case scenario —we end up in the backstop — we will have achieved all those things and will get a veto over new EU directives.We wouldn’t have to pay a single penny of membership costs.I’m not pretending the deal is flawless. We need to improve it to know we can’t be trapped in the backstop forever, and to ensure the EU can’t impose dferent rules in Northern Ireland from the rest of our country.But it sometimes seems that the Prime Minister’s critics cannot see the wood for the trees.Eurosceptics used to say what we wanted was to turn off the tap of endless new European laws, to stop the ratchet where the answer to every question seemed to be “more Brussels”, and to go back to a trading relationship. That’s ­literally what this deal does.So why did her deal suffer such a ­historic defeat last month Some MPs have deeply held concerns, particularly about the backstop, that the Government is rightly trying to address. Some are pursuing perfection. Others — especially in the Labour Party — are just playing politics.But there’s also a group for whom the real issue is personal as well as the policy.They just don’t have faith in the Prime Minister. This is no big secret.More than a third of Tory MPs —  of them — voted against her leadership back in December. To get through that, Theresa May had to promise she wouldn’t lead the party into the next election. But now she may have to go further.I’ve heard senior backbenchers on all sides of the Conservative Party say that their concern about voting for the deal, is that it could mean the Prime Minister stays in place to negotiate our future relationship with the EU.They want someone  to take forward the next phase.If Theresa May manages to agree a deal — and I think she ultimately can — she will have achieved Mission Impossible.But to scrape that deal through the Commons she might, as Sun columnist James Forsyth has suggested, have to throw the kitchen sink at it by agreeing to step aside.Downing Street aides privately acknowledge that she doesn’t want to “go on and on”. They know she faces another inevitable and painful leadership challenge by the end of the year — they want to see her leave with her dignity intact.It’s likely Brussels will eventually give some reassurance on the backstop.This might not quite be the full ­open-heart surgery changes to the deal some want.But the test should be whether the legal position changes. If it does, then the deal deserves to pass.And then, come the end of March, we can stop endlessly re-running referendum arguments about whether we should or shouldn’t leave the EU.We can get on with arguing about what sort of country we want to be after Brexit.We can discuss what we want to do with our newly won ­freedoms.And as a country we can start to move on together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I also saw a lot of Disney figures which you could win.“We barely touched anything, because there is radioactive dust.“Its a unique location, because you normally dont get to see a SEGA arcade hall which is fully intact.“I only noticed vending and cash machines were pried open by looters.“Normally they would take out the prizes and sell the arcades.

The clean-up and rehabilitation happens really quick and former red zones are coming back to le.“Thats why I think its important to show the real aftermath of the disaster before all traces are gone.”A magnitude nine earthquake – the strongest to ever hit Japan – rocked the region in March , and a subsequent tsunami destabilised the Fukushima nuclear power plant.The spot has remained near-leless ever since, hidden from the outside world behind government exclusion zones – put in place for fear of radiation contamination.Some of the games in the venue included Sonic the Hedgehog, Donkey Kong, House of the Dead, and many more, including toys of Disney characters and talking bears.Bob, who visited the site for his YouTube channel, Exploring the Unbeaten Path, wasn’t surprised by the pristine condition of the games hall. Having visited multiple spots within Fukushima, he believes the people of Japan respect the boundaries put in place, which has helped to preserve it as a near eight-year-old time piece.He said: “I wasnt surprised, because almost everything is left untouched in the forbidden zone.“Everywhere  in the world these buildings would be totally looted after a few weeks.“The Japanese people really respect the rules and never trespass, evendoors are wide open.Bob initially spotted the locations during a trip to the country in , but was unable to reach it.Now having gone back to document the dying remains of Fukushima, he hopes others will respect and appreciate the hall too.Bob added: “We drove by this location in  on route six - at that time the only open road which goes through the red zone - and I really wanted to see it.“But because there was a lot of activity in the red zone - demolition, renovation, radioactive clean-up - we didnt manage to get there.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472662593.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hannibal lecter fanatic student head hammer eat liver","story":"Lawyer Christian Stuenkel, who represents the family of the victim, said the fictional serial killer was the accuseds biggest idol and he watched all the films and series again and again”.The suspect, who was only identied as -year-old Vietnamese student Nhat T., appeared for the first time in the district court of Gera in the German state of Thuringia.Like his hero Lecter, the main character in the series of novels written by Thomas Harris and portrayed onscreen by Anthony Hopkins, Nhat T. was handcuffed as he was led into the courtroom.Lacking Lecters trademark face mask, which covers his mouth and nose, he instead hid his face inside his hoodie.In August , the student, who attended university in the central German city of Jena, gave himself up to cops and reportedly admitted to killing his Chinese classmate Chenxi L earlier the same month.During the trial, the court hopes to find out what Nhat T. did with the body after he allegedly smashed the victims head in with the hammer.Investigators found the body of the Chinese student, , hacked to pieces and stuffed into plastic bags.Some body parts were found by a special ing team in the River Saale while the victim’s head was found under a bridge.Prosecutor Martin Zschaechner confirmed that the victim’s liver was missing from its body and an autopsy showed signs of it being removed by a sharp instrument such as a kne.As the liver was never found, prosecutors believe the suspect might have eaten it given his great fondness of his flesh-munching hero Lecter.Prosecutor Zschaechner said: “The film ‘Hannibal’ definitely played a big role in the defendant’s le. The liver was selectively removed .”The prosecutor was referring to the  Oscar-winning movie The Silence of the Lambs, when the infamous cannibal psychiatrist says his famous line: I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.According to the prosecutors, Nhat T. lured Chenxi L. into his student flat by telling him that a package had arrived for him, turning up the music volume and striking him with a hammer.Afterwards, he allegedly hacked the body into pieces in the bath tub.Prosecutors suspect the defendant might suffer from schizophrenia.A mental assessment by a court psychologist has been ordered to find out more about the Vietnamese students state of mind.According to the prosecution, Nhat T. searched for terms such as Hannibal Lecter, secure killing methods and psychological illnesses around , times on the internet before the murder.Before the murder inside student housing accommodation in Jena, the suspect allegedly watched ‘The Silence of the Lambs’ several times and the sequel ‘Hannibal’.Investigators also suspect that the student acted out of greed as he stole the victims computer and mobile phone and ordered expensive goods on the internet using his money.The trial is ongoing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everyone falls for Imran,’ she said. He has a scent that is very attractive to women.It proved to be the case for Sita White, daughter of GordonWhite, who was co-founder of the international building materials company Hanson plc.Heiress to her father’s multi-million pound fortune, she met Khan on the dance floor at Tramp and embarked on a relationship which would last, on and off, for the next six years and end in controversy when, in , she bore a child, Tyrian Jade and claimed Khan was the father.Khan’s response  To first ignore her claims and then deny them - although in  a US judge ruled he was the father.By then Khan had long moved on to pastures new in the shapely form of Jemima Goldsmith, another heiress who would become his first we.The daughter of business tycoon Sir James Goldsmith, Jemima was just  to his  when they met in , but the couple were engaged within weeks and duly married in a two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris followed by a civil ceremony in London.Their honeymoon was more colourful – not in the least because photos of them making love by a swimming pool were circulated among British newspapers although never published.Such was her devotion to her new husband that Jemima converted to Islam and the couple settled in Lahore – where Khan set about trying to shed his playboy reputation, emphasising his respect for Muslim culture.After their marriage ended, in , Khan was rumoured to have enjoyed a short dalliance with Elizabeth Hurley.It was through Jemima – with whom he had two sons, Sulaiman and Qasim – that Khan became friendly with Princess Diana.He later claimed that he had been asked by Diana to act as a marriage broker with heart surgeon Dr Hasnat Khan just three months before her  death.By then his political ambitions were in full swing.In , Khan founded his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf., although he did not win a seat until , the year his marriage foundered.Over the following years, with his own political star rising, Khan appeared to turn his back on domesticity until, in  he married BBC presenter Reham Khan.The union lasted less than a year, with Khan calling their marriage the “biggest mistake” he had made – a sentiment no doubt fuelled by Khan’s decision to publish a tell-all book in which she made a number of lurid claims about her ex-husband, among them that he believes in black magic and had bedded Bollywood actresses and had children with four other women.The startling revelations seem to have done little to dampen his native country’s enthusiasm for Khan, whose longstanding political ambitions reached their pinnacle last August when he became Pakistan’s nd Prime Minister.He did so with a new we by his side, this time a leading Islamic mystic by the name of Bushra Maneka, from whom Khan had sought spiritual guidance three years earlier.Khan did not see her face until after their wedding — although he had seen a photograph of her as a young woman. In public she remains veiled, while, in the traditional Muslim dress he now favours, Khan is the very image of a sober, conservative politician.It is a world away from the young man who cut a swathe through Londons most beautul women.But then as Khan has frequently said: I never claim to have led an angelic le.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a shareholder in hundreds of ­companies, from Greggs and ­Wetherspoons through to Superdry and Moneysupermarket.The UK is already the third-largest destination for this Norwegian investment, and now they’re putting in more.It seems almost surprising, given the endless choruses of woe about Brexit and the pathetic state of our political class in Westminster. Who would want to bet on a country where the job of economic cheerleader is held by Philip Hammond, and the ­alternative is an out-and-out Marxist like John McDonnell The answer is that the Norwegians can see what we sometimes miss about our own country: The UK is a fantastic place to do business.Our legal system is respected around the world for its fairness and is viewed as a “gold standard” under which to sign contracts and do deals.Our corporate taxes are competitive, and are set to fall further. Our location and time zone help to make us a good bridge into markets around the world.Our language is spoken by billions of people, and is the chosen tongue of global business.Our culture is one that still prizes innovation and hard work, despite the best efforts of some Chancellors over the years.And most of all, our people — our greatest asset — are skilled and creative, as employers, inventors and workers alike.It doesn’t come naturally for us to blow our own trumpets and talk ourselves up, so sometimes it feels a bit awkward to ­consider the many things we have going for us.And we all love a good moan, to the degree that it’s essentially a national sport. But we should be careful that we don’t go too far and start to talk ­ourselves down.There’s a dference between being modest and acting like Eeyore with a hangover. Brexit in particular seems to have driven some people a bit loopy, so that you hear some who were once quite ­sensible now ranting about “destroying the country” or “falling off a clf edge”.To hear them, you would think we are a repellent disaster zone, about to slip beneath the waves never to be seen again, like Atlantis crossed with Towie.This is obviously ridiculous. Of course it’s possible that the process of leaving the EU will be dficult.Thanks to politicians who are still ­incapable of honouring their promises and agreeing a clear way forward, the uncertainty about our future ­relationship with our European neighbours has been allowed to drag on for far too long.But it isn’t Brussels, or even Westminster, that made this country wealthy and successful. It is an enterprising approach to le, combining imagination and hard work, that got us this far.Businesspeople and workers, not ­politicians, created the UK’s success.That won’t go away just because we aren’t paying Jean-Claude Juncker’s lunch expenses any more.And once we escape Brussels’ control, we will be free to be even more ­innovative and nimble in response to all the challenges and opportunities the modern age throws at us.The people entrusted with Norway’s £billion national wealth fund can see that. And they aren’t alone.In the latest available data, the UK was Europe’s top destination for foreign investment.Unlike the blowhards and scaremongers chucking out doom and gloom for ­retweets and laughs, these are serious investors, putting their money where their mouth is and betting that our country has a bright future.I know who I’d believe.Norway fund has holdings in:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it has severely weakened our hopes of getting the one thing Brexiteers and the DUP need.Cabinet Remainers are guilty both of rank disloyalty and short-sighted stupidity.FOR a shining example of Remoaner madness, witness the negativity to Norway’s huge investment in post-Brexit Britain.Its £billion wealth fund is increasing its UK holdings because, like Qatar, it is sure we will thrive outside the EU.To ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie, though, Norway is just hoovering up our assets on the cheap due to Brexit.

The research, which polled , adults, found pie enthusiasts consume a huge amount of pastry over the years, chowing down on at least  pies every year. It also emerged the nation’s favourite pie is the classic beef and ale, but proving we still have a sweet tooth, apple pie came in second place. This was closely followed by chicken and mushroom and steak and kidney pie, with lemon meringue revealed as another of the our favourite dessert pies.   The research was commissioned by Jus-Rol to celebrate the start of British Pie Week which is between the th and th of March. To mark the occasion Jus-Rol teamed with food artist, Prudence Staite, to create iconic scenes and depictions from around the UK – made entirely from pies. The series of seven art pieces which took  painstaking hours to make and place , inidually handmade cooked and uncooked pies per image used a whopping  kg of Jus-Rol Shortcrust, Puff and Filo pastry. Spokeswoman for Jus-Rol, Holly Bouldin, said: “The humble beef and ale pie has been a true British classic for as long as we can remember, but it’s surprising to see some dessert pastries so high up in the list. “Other British pie classics – including chicken and mushroom, beef mince and chicken and leek – also made the list of melt-in-your-mouth fillings.   “The research shows that whether sweet or savoury, Brits can enjoy a good pie during any occasion – and it turns out very few would turn down the chance to eat one of these tasty pastry dishes.” The study, carried out by One Poll, also found that Northern Ireland chomps its way through more pies than anyone  in Britain, with one in  consuming six pies every month, compared to a national average of three per month. They are followed by Londoners and those in the North East as the most avid pie eaters, with one in seven eating four pies a month in both areas.  When it comes to dusting off the rolling pins and making pies at home, Northern Ireland came out on top – baking on average two pies a month. However,  per cent admitted they don’t even use a rolling pin – with one in  opting for a wine bottle to smooth out their pastry. Many Brits even go free-style and simply use their hands to stretch out that pastry, with one in  from the South West most likely to adopt this method.  Other popular, ingenious alternatives to the rolling pin include fizzy drinks cans, milk bottles, thermos flasks and even tall drinking glasses. Bouldin said: “Founded back in  by Jus-Rol, British Pie Week aims to inspire the nation to celebrate one of the greatest British classic foods. We wanted to pay tribute to that love by creating images out of pies that reflect ious areas of the UK.” “And these survey results reveal the true depth of the nation’s feelings towards pies.

He allegedly caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to the front door of the flat near Sutton, south London, which the couple bought for pound, in . They were then told by police it was unsafe for them to live there with their young son, they say. Now Michelle and Jason have sued vendor and former occupant Christopher Flynn for thousands of pounds.   Central London County Court had the dispute down for a trial but a decision was quickly made today that Mr Flynn must cough up.The court was heard Mr Flynn knew the aggressive violent tendencies of his neighbour, but failed to disclose it in pre-sale documents.Lawyers for the couple said in court documents: On the first weekend after completion,  June , whilst Ms Smith and Mr Stevens were in the property preparing for redecoration, Mr Stevens, his stepfather and mother were subjected to a violent outburst.   The police attended the scene and the general advice given to the couple, in the light of having an infant son, was not to live in the property until it was safe to do so. The court heard the couple claimed thousands in compensation for distress and inconvenience, repair of their door, and costs related to accommodation and mortgage payments while they say they were unable to live there. But Mr Flynns lawyers denied he acted dishonestly or that the neighbours behaviour was his responsibility after he moved out. Their court documents read: It is admitted that there was a dispute between Mr Flynn and his former neighbour, but that this was a dispute which had ended circa one year and a half prior to marketing the property.   The dispute by the neighbour against Mr Flynn was personal to Mr Flynn...following resolution of the dispute there were no further issues. It is not admitted that Mr Flynn ly completed the property forms or that he denied the existence of such issues with the neighbour. It is not accepted that Mr Flynn misrepresented the sale....It is also not admitted that the alleged representations were made in order to induce Mr Stevens and Ms Smith to enter into contract to purchase the property.

I have no doubt the Strictly Come Dancing champion meant well with her Instagram snaps in which she breathlessly tells us she’s “OB.SESSSSSSSSSSED” with the nameless little boy she’s clutching while wearing designer clothes. CRINGE!   But David Lammy is right, it’s both patronising and condescending to the people they’re trying to help and I’m glad he’s called her out for acting like a “white saviour” who’s perpetuating “tired and unhelpful stereotypes”. Comic Relief has a huge  and privilege and it’s the first major way children learn about Africa,” he said. “If they only show Africans as helpless victims to be pitied, children missed the broader picture of huge progress in Africa.” How can anyone disagree with this  Dooley weakly hit back at the politician saying: “You could always go there and try to raise awareness ”   In fact he’s been asked but he said no because he was didn’t want to become “part of a PR exercise”. Instead of launching an attack on Lammy, Dooley and Comic Relief should listen to what he has to say. Like David, I too feel deeply uncomfortable with this tired negative narrative that portrays Africa as a nation of starving, helpless people waiting for white people to come and save their lives. Throwing money at men, women and children is not to only way to help. For example, Comic Relief could save thousands of pounds on travel expensesthey used local camera crews, producers and editors.   This way they would be giving jobs to people to provide for themselves and their families. As someone who regularly goes to Ghana, west Africa, I can tell you the pictures of starving children covered in flies and living on rubbish dumps are not one that I see. In fact that’s one of the reasons AfroBeats artist Fuse ODG turned down Bob Geldof’s request to take part in the Band Aid  – he was frustrated with how negatively the lyrics portrayed Africa. I see a country undergoing rapid transition, incredible growth and one with a very bright future. If you’re planning a holiday, I can’t recommend it highly enough. Sometimes I think it has more going for it that Brexit Britain right now.

Since then I have been working with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, Healthwatch England and many others on what matters most to patients, on the clinical issues with the current target regime, and what NHS staff believe will help them provide the best quality care for patients.

Narrated by Dame Julie Walters, the advert focuses on the relationship between a father and daughter played by ‘dad’ Alex Pepper and his daughter eight-year-old Xanthe Lebus-Smith. In the advert Xanthe describes her every move in a football match she is playing in as Alex stands pitchside with other parents – an everyday scenario that many people will be familiar with. During the match she shouts out: “I’m over here dad, on the wing. “Dad, I’m tackling. I’m running. “I did a header. I got the ball, dad. “I’m going to shoot, dad.” But she just misses the goal and looks sad.   The advert cuts to the father and daughter holding hands as they walk away from the park and she tells him: “I was really close, dad.” The camera pans up to reveal that her dad is blind as he tells her with a big smile: “I know sweetheart. I think you were brilliant out there today.” The advert, which will premiere on ITV at .pm during Dancing on Ice on Sunday, aims to sht public sympathy for those with sight loss into empathy and further understanding of the realities of le with little or no sight. It comes as research shows that people with sight loss do not feel that wider society understands the challenges they face, with many feeling ‘left out’ of everyday le and milestone le moments. It also reflects an evolution of its brand positioning to become more people-centred and move beyond its well-loved dogs. Alex, , a former Met Police emergency call handler who lost his eyesight in , said that his own personal experience reflects that research. He developed retinoblastoma, a rare form of eye cancer, as a baby and had an eye removed at  months.  The cancer recurred in his other eye, aged , but after treatment his vision was quite stable from his mid-teens until , when one morning everything changed. He remembers: I had about % - % vision before . It made some things dficult but I could still get around on my own. My vision had been stable for years so it was a huge shock when I woke up one morning and there was a shadow in the corner of my eye. I was panicky and scared but I thought it was a detached retina which could be operated on. But at an emergency appointment that afternoon my surgeon, who had successfully operated on me before, told me that I had too much scarring already in my eye and poor blood supply so they could not operate.   Then, between January, , and May, , my sight deteriorated until all I had left was light perception at best. It was a very dficult time. I realised that sight loss was like losing a loved one. You grieve. Youre never going to get over it but you can learn to get on with it. Its made me reflect on whats important in le. Once you cant see anymore, you realise how much you used to focus on things that actually dont matter. I talk to people in the street now who I probably wouldnt have spoken to before, and people speak to me who probably would not have approachedI didnt have a cane or a dog.  Its like you see no evil. Thats a real silver lining. Before, I was always trying to hide my sight loss. To fit in as much as I could. Like when I went through Victoria train station in London every day for work. I was too proud to use a magnier to check the train times on my phone app or ask the staff for help. But I knew that every train on two s would go to my stop. So I would see which  people were rushing to more and I would follow them to that train. It worked but it was hugely stressful. But now Ive lost that fear and I can go anywhere with my dog and ask for help. So in a weird way its been a relief. Sight loss has taken down so many barriers that I put up for myself in the first place.  But Alex has noticed how people sometimes treat him dferently now and he believes this stems form a misunderstanding of disability. He said: Like at a train station,I have passenger assistance and staff members are bringing me from one place to another, staff will ask each other wheres he going  when Im standing right there. I tell them myself where Im going with a smile and people can seem quite surprised when they realise that although I have a guide dog I can still speak for myself. Im not a blind person, Im just a person who happens to be blind. Theres nothing very dferent about me, it just happens that I cant see.   People can get uncomfortable around disability because they have not had the conversations before but I hope this campaign can open peoples eyes to the fact that people with sight-loss can live a normal le. “Its weird, since Ive had my amazing guide dog River Ive been asked directions a lot more than I ever had before in central London. My friends laugh that people ask a blind person for directions, but the really funny thing is that I always know where to direct them.” Alex worked for the Met police for four and a half years as a communications officer, handling emergency calls. However, after losing the majority of his eye sight, he joined national sight loss charity, London Vision, as project co-ordinator. He has a step daughter, , and a niece, , both of whom are obsessed with his guide dog, River. He is getting married in May, so he and his fianceacutee are in the thick of wedding planning.  He said: My fianceacutee and I are planning our wedding at the moment. People always talk about that moment when a man sees his bride walk down the aisle. Ill never have that but my fianceacutee, friends and family are making sure Im included in other ways. When we were visiting venues I couldnt get the wow factor anywhere because I couldnt see them. But then we walked into one venue with a lake and a water feature. There was this other sensory experience. I could hear the water and the place just felt so tranquil and I loved it. Luckily my fiancee did too – she was in tears she liked it so much so we chose to marry there. We had only been together for six or seven months when I lost my al vision. It was a very, very dficult time but she went through it all with me. She has been amazing. “I noticed the other day just how well my six-year-old step-daughter has adapted to my sight loss too. I asked a friend how she was with a question and when her friend nodded in reply, she immediately said, shes nodding yes.  I was waiting on a phone call from the Guide Dogs saying they might have a dog for me for months. It was my last step to freedom. Id call them every day asking. When the call came and I went to meet my amazing guide dog River I was more nervous than Id ever been in my le. Excuse the pun but it was like a blind date. I knew that every match does not work. I was sitting in the room, waiting for them to bring River in, heart pounding, sweating, and River came in, snfed me and lay at my feet. His trainer said I think he likes you. And that was it. River has changed my le. Guide Dogs made me realise that help is out there. If you suffer sight loss, take advantages of the resources available – reach out to organisations, family and friends.

The young aspiring actor, soccer-player and dog-trainer said: “My favourite part of the ad was talking to Alex. He made me laugh a lot and he told me about his guide dog River. I told him about our puppy Ziggy too who is not as well-behaved as River.” But Xanthe said that River inspired her to train up Ziggy to be as good as River one day and she learned other lessons from their interaction too. She said: “I learned that when you see someone with a guide dog you should not touch it without asking the owner first because the dog is working and it will get distractedyou touch it.

High profile patients like Wayne Rooney, cricket legend Shane Warne and Coronation Street star Jack P Shepherd have planted the once secret surgery firmly out in the open.The number of hair transplants has almost triped since  when just , were carried out. In  a total of , people opted to go under the kne to have their hair restored.   But it would seem some chaps are still not comfortable to admit when theyve undergone the innovative op. Dr Bessam Farjo has clinics in both Manchester and London and is one of the leading hair restoration surgeons. Speaking tohe said: There are people in the spotlight who its agreed have had some work done.In my opinion Bradley Cooper has had some very good work done on his hairline.I say the same of Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson.   John Travolta, I dont believe, has had any work done but he wears a lot of hair pieces and wigs and has recently been pictured with a shaved head. Dr Farjo believes the huge rise in the number of men opting to have the surgery, which costs around pound, in the UK, is down to a breakdown in stigma. He explained: The rise, in part, has been driven by celebrities and the general public being open about what they’ve had done. Terms like metrosexual are a little old hat now, but what began with that trend has led to procedures like this becoming more commonplace today. We are looking after ourselves more, and there is less stigma around men taking pride in their appearance.  If men don’t like something about their body, and they see ‘normal blokes’ like Wayne Rooney, James Nesbit or Shane Warne doing it, they thing ‘why not ’ And the rise in the success - and the reduction in cost - of hair transplants has also helped to break down the stigma. But the surgeon insists hair loss, or male pattern baldness, is not on the increase. More than a third of men have some kind of hair loss by the time theyre , and up to half of blokes aged . There are two manin types of transplant surgery.  The first involves surgeons reoving inidual hair follicles from the scalp using punches. The the surgeon makes microscopic slits in the receiving area of the patient’s scalp, and the inidual grafts will be placed into these sites by the doctor and his team. This is popular because it doesnt leave a hairline scar, instead just tiny dot scars. The treatment can take up to  hours and can involve , grafts in a single day. Hair starts to grow about four months after surgery and will keep growing for the next  to  months. The second involves using a thin strip skin with hair on it from somewhere  on the scalp known as the permanent area.  This is where hairs are genetically programmed to keep growing for le. It had to be done under local anaesthetic and uses high-powered microscopes to dissect the healthy hair follicles and transplant them into the area affected by hair loss. The surgery can take up to  hours and again it can take the hair four months to start to grow. But there can be risks when it comes to hair transplants, especially when people opt for a cheaper transplant abroad. Dr Farjo explained: There’s a growing number of ‘unethical’ hair restoration clinics — both here in the UK and abroad — mostly operated by non-doctors. In the worst of cases, patients attending these run the risk of becoming disfigured with an unnatural looking hairline or wasting priceless donor hair for future use.  However, we hear procedures can be sourced for as little as pound from some clinics, with many cheap operators typically located in Turkey. That may sound tempting, but it really isn’t worth the risk. In the UK, any clinic offering a hair transplant surgery must register with the Care Quality Commissionand will therefore be inspected. If a doctor operates on a patient in a non-CQC registered hair transplant clinic then they are breaking the law. Additionally, doctors in the UK must abide by strict ethical guidelines set by the General Medical Council , and must be covered by regulated liability insurers. If they breach this guidance, a patient can report them to the GMC.

Birmingham and Leeds are among the cities set to introduce the zones to improve air quality in those areas - potentially requiring drivers to pay a fee. The Clean Air Zones scheme is part of the Government’s Air Quality Plan, announced in July , which aims to reduce pollution and make the air cleaner throughout the UK. London already has its own Ultra Low Emission Zone which from th April will see higher polluting vehicles charged pound. a day to enter. Commissioned by Hitachi Capital UK, the research of , UK adults found around a third think there is a particularly signicant problem with pollution where they live. And eight in  think urgent action needs to be taken to reduce emissions.   Jon Lawes, managing director of Hitachi Capital Vehicle Solutions, said: “Despite the potential dent to our wallets, the research shows there is signicant support for charging schemes that tackle pollution in our major towns and cities. “It’s clear those polled believe something needs to be done – and fast.” The research also found half of motorists polled admit they are ‘too reliant’ on their car. In fact, the car is the number one way Brits get to work– miles ahead of public transportand foot . Further to this,  per cent agree we should make greater use of public transport and leave our vehicles at home more often. Six in  also believe the move towards electric vehicles is a good thing but just  per cent have owned or currently do own one. Those polled reveal free charging ports and more of them, reassurances over how long the battery lasts and greater financial incentives would encourage them to get an electric vehicle. Despite the positivity surrounding the introduction of clean air zones, previous attempts to reduce emissions and congestion have had mixed results according to those polled.   Seventy-nine per cent believe bus lanes have made no dference to the number of cars on the road. Eight in  think car share lanes have had no impact on air quality – and  per cent think the same goes for cycle lanes. Despite this, the Hitachi Capital UK research carried out through OnePoll found support for Clean Air Zones is so strong a third think it would be ‘fair’companies pass any additional costs on to customers. Jon Lawes added: “Whilst it’s very encouraging that the poll shows more and more drivers see alternative fuel vehicles as the long-term solution to reducing air pollution where other schemes haven’t worked, these findings highlight the obstacles that still need to be overcome to persuade drivers to truly embrace greener alternatives. “Although the pound million scrappage incentive scheme recently announced to help Londoners is welcome, both private and business vehicle owners are facing financial pressure in upgrading to greener options in the short term. “Our own research has found that the migration to alternative fuels could deliver fuel cost savings running into billions of pounds for vehicle owners, whilst advances in alternative fuel vehicle performance and infrastructure are certainly changing driver perceptions. “So while there may be a short-term cost to consumers and businesses, by encouraging people to invest in greener vehicles, the benefits in the long term will be signicant, not only financially but environmentally too.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hatton garden suspect had 143000","story":"NewsHatton Garden suspect had £, of stolen jewellery and gold hidden in flatMichael Seed, , was arrested in March  after Flying Squad detectives searched his one-bedroom council flatShareCommentsByTom Pettor:,  FEB NewsMichael Seed is alleged to be the raider known as “Basil” \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPolice who raided the final Hatton Garden suspect’s home found stolen jewellery and gold worth pound,, a court heard yesterday.

There are fears the famous animals that roam the Hampshire National Park could be ingesting dangerous plastics and poisonous foods on a regular basis. The local council does not operate a wheelie bin system and so homeowners have to leave out bin bags for collection. But the flimsy black sacks attract the wild ponies who devour the contents. The troubling photographs, taken in the picturesque village of Bransgore, show the creatures feasting on the contents of the black bags.   In one image, a pony is seen nose-deep in a pile of rubbish, with a number of Carlsberg beer cans strewn across the ground. In another four of the animals are depicted munching on nine bin bags left against a garden fence. Villagers have accused New Forest District Council of putting the ponies at risk by not issuing wheelie bins. Local resident Kate White: Its really sad that this carries on week after week. I regularly come across ponies and donkeys eating rubbish at the side of the road.   I have notied the council about it three times already and they say they will pass it on to the refuse team. But its disappointing because the council doesnt do anything about it. I dont know why residents dont have wheelie bins. Ponies have roamed the New Forest for thousands of years, pre-dating the last ice age. Today they are owned by commoners - landowners who have ancient rights to allow animals to graze on the forest - and have free rein around the woodland.  The current population stands at about , and continue to be a major attraction to tourists. New Forest District Council said that keeping rubbish away from the ponies was the responsibility of homeowners, not them. On its website, the council states: Your rubbish is your responsibility before it has been collectedanimals do split the bags then you are responsible for clearing it up. A council spokesperson added: We are aware that this is sometimes an issue in this area. We are clearing the rubbish and will be reminding residents to keep their sacks inside their gates, as they live where there are free-roaming animals, and not to put rubbish out before pm the evening before collection.

In , up to , children aged  and  did not get their first choice as they moved up to secondary school. Its a scenario that thousands of students will face when offers are emailed out, with a recent study finding one in five children will not be able to attend their preferred school. A majority do get their first choice, but what should you doyour child doesnt and you are unhappy about it    Parents can file an appeal to have the decision overturned. Here is some advice on how to do that. How to appeal Parents can challenge the decision through a formal appeal process with the admission authority - the local council or the school itself. The first step is to accept the place their child has been given, eventhey dont want it. Parents who dont accept the spot and appeal could leave their child without a school when the new year starts in September, as local authorities do not have to offer an alternative.Appeals can be filed with each school named on the preference form. So,a child is given their third choice, his or her parents orcan appeal to their first and second choice schools. Details on the appeal process are supposed to be included in the letter with the decision. They can also be obtained from the admission authority, usually on the local council or schools website.Parents can also check the Governments School Admission Appeals Code.Provide strong evidence   Parents who appeal the decision must provide strong evidence in writing explaining why their child should be given a spot at their preferred school. In recent years, only a quarter of appeals were successful. Potential grounds for appeal can include admission procedures being wrongly applied or potential harm to a child. Families must appeal against each rejection separately and can only appeal once against each rejection. What is the timeline  The admission authority for the school must allow at least  school days to appeal from when they send the decision letter, the Government says. It adds: The admission authority will set a deadline for submitting information and evidence to support your appeal. If you submit anything after the deadline, it might not be considered and may result in delays to your hearing. Families must be given at least  school days notice of the hearing. Appeals must be heard within  school days of the deadline for making an appeal. What happens at the appeal hearing   Appeal hearings are overseen by a  of three or more people. The  must be independent and follow the School Admission Appeals Code. At the hearing, the admission authority will explain why the application was turned down, and the parent will be given a chance to explain why their child should be admitted. Its up to the  to decide whether the school’s admission criteria were properly followed and comply with the code. If the criteria were not properly followed or do not comply with the school admissions code your appeal must be upheld, the Government says. It adds: If your reasons for your child to be admitted outweigh the school’s reasons for not admitting any more children at all, your appeal will be upheld. The decision is usually sent within five school days. Join waiting lists Parents who are advised to get on waiting lists for schools that they prefer, in case a place opens up between National Offer Day and the first day of term in September. To do that, contact the local authority or the school. The Government advises: If your child is on a waiting list and the school offers you a place, the admission authority will send you a formal offer. You can still accept the offer evenyour child has already started at another school. There is a shortage of places in some places. A  survey found a third of pupils in London did not get their first choice.

Fi, a male Shih-Tzu, was also found to have eye and skin problems when checked on by an RSPCA inspector at his home in Grisby.The dog may have been infested with the flees for up to two years in what his his vet said was the worst flee infection he had ever seen, Grimsby Live reports.Fi ultimately had to be put down due to an unrelated issue. David Morris, , and his we, Susan Morris, , of Southland Court, Grimsby, denied three offences of causing unnecessary suffering to a dog but were convicted after a trialNo veterinary help was called in - this could have been because the couple who owned the dog could not afford the cost of it, a court heard. In a tragic twist, he later had to be put down due to another problem. Gordon Holt, prosecuting for the RSPCA, told Grimsby magistrates that an inspector visited the couples home on January  last year and examined the dog, a Shih-Tzu aged nine or ten. Despite being male, it was called Fi.  The dogs fur was badly matted, it had a fleas infection and it had a dry eye problem. Those conditions were causing suffering to the dog, said Mr Holt. The owners should have taken the dog to a vet based on what they could see of its condition. There was clear evidence that there was suffering to this animal and it had been going on for some time, said Mr Holt. There were thousands and thousands of fleas and the infestation would have been there for about two years.  This dog was riddled with fleas, added Mr Holt.Police seized the dog and it was taken to the Blue Cross Animal Hospital, Grimsby , where a vet clipped it from head to toe to get rid of the matting.The dog would have been unable to scratch itches because of the matting and the flea bites would have been painful. The vet believed Fi had been caused unnecessary suffering, said Mr Holt. The vet said: I have never seen a flea infection that was so bad. Fleas were visible on every part of his body. Twenty fleas escaped from a square inch of the dogs skin and there were fleas around the eyes and neck.  The dog was put down six months later, in June, because of a suspected central nervous problem. David Morris later said of the dog: I rescued him off the street. I have had him six or seven years. I feel we have rescued Fi from certain death on the day I rescued him. I have not been cruel but possibly I have been stupid. I am bereftmy dog has suffered.Susan Morris claimed she did not notice the skin and eye conditions but bathed the dog sometimes for fleas.Defence barrister Hywel Davies claimed: There were no signs of discomfort or suffering. They were not to know. Nothing there warrants a trip to the vets. Ex-window cleaner David Morris, a trained nurse for  years, told the court that he found the stray dog on the streets.Part of the reason he did not alert a vet was that he feared that it would turn out to be microchipped and would be taken back to that awful place where he believed it had been cruelly treated. The prosecution claimed that the real reason was that the couple could not afford vets bills. He claimed that he did not see any eye or skin problems. I never noticed any problems, he said. I didnt think it was causing him any discomfort. It didnt seem to bother him. We knew there were fleas. We must have used every flea shampoo, flea powder that was available. If a new flea product came out, we used it. It seemed to reduce them to some extent. He didnt seem to be bothered by having them. He didnt whine and didnt scratch unduly. He just seemed a happy little dog. There was no cause for them to have concern about the dog suffering at any time. If he had, he would have been taken to a vet immediately, claimed Morris. I didnt think he was suffering in any way. Susan Morris told the court: He was just fine. I used to give him baths. I saw a few fleas on him but I was treating it, sometimes two, three times a week. It got better. He was just like a normal dog. He wasnt suffering at all. Sentence on the couple was adjourned for reports and they were allowed bail.

Bearded ft in giant Terry Waite is better placed than most to discuss forgiving someone groomed at  who ran away to join Islamic State in Syria. Hezbollah militants blindfolded, chained, beat and tortured him for nearly five years in neighbouring Lebanon. Despite never knowinghe’d live to see tomorrow between January  and November  – and enduring mock executions – Waite’s absence of malice towards his captors is how this former envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury treats most people.  And that includes the teenager from Bethnal Green, East London, enticed into a medieval theocratic death cult, then unfazed by the sight of severed heads. Waite is highly critical of the Home Secretary for banning Begum, removing the right to a passport of a young woman now a -year-old mother languishing in a Syrian refugee camp. “It was not a good or wise decision to revoke her UK citizenship,” asserts Waite. “This seems to me like a typical kneejerk reaction which is all too commonly followed by Government these days. “To declare the young woman stateless is, I believe, an action that is declared illegal in international law which we endorsed. This action is almost certain to be overturned and Britain will once again have lost credibility on the international stage. “It is my view that she ought to be subject to the law andit is found that she has broken that law then she should be subject to due process of the law.   “Thereafter she ought to be treated with compassion with regard to the fact that she is a young person who may well have been pressured into behaving as she did. “It goes without saying that I believe all iniduals who are convicted ought to be treated with compassion and understanding.” Sajid Javid’s gamble has backfired that Bangladesh, a country Begum has never visited or had a passport from, would take the marooned figure because of her parents’ links. The depth of public hostility towards her led to a Merseyside shooting range in Wallasey using a picture of the teenager’s shrouded head for target practice.  Yet Waite’s faith in the possibilities of redemption extend to the Islamic State teenager. But her crimes,any – Begum insists she was a housewe not a fighter – aren’t in the league of another woman who found a friend in Waite. The prison reformer befriended Myra Hindley, the notorious Moors Murderer. She was serial killer Ian Brady’s accomplice in the grisly slayings of five youngsters in the first half of the s. Hindley, often visited in jail by Waite before her death behind bars in , was, he believes, genuinely remorseful about her role in the horric crimes.  Her release, he thinks, was blocked because she’d been turned into an “icon of evil” by a haunting photograph and folk demanding vengeance. “I met with Myra Hindley,” recalls Waite, “who, as an emotional young woman, fell under the spell of a psychopath and then had the solitude of having to live with those terrible events. “She was demonised, definitely, and never freed for, I think, that simple reason.” Waite, reflective as he prepares to celebrate his th birthday in May, is speaking to me by video call from New Zealand. He stresses he offers “no excuses. Explanations, yes, but definitely no excuses” for Hindley’s involvement in the sexual abuse, torture and deaths of the five, then adds: “There have been people in prison who did equally terrible things and were released. “She had been made into an icon of evil. She used to say ‘I would like to get out and try again in le’ and I used to say ‘Myra, you would be in great danger because you have been made this icon of evil and someone will try to have a go’. “She said that was a chance she was willing to take.”  Waite first met jailed Hindley in Durham where she was held in the same block as serial killer Rose West, sentenced to the rest of her le in prison after she and husband Fred sexually assaulted and murdered at least  young women in their Gloucester home. He also talked to Hindley in Suffolk’s Highpoint Prison, visiting many times.In his book Solitude he noted she was sallow skinned, overweight, smoked heavily and suffered high blood pressure and osteoporosis.“I visited her many times across the years and, without in any way minimising her crimes, I am fairly confident the remorse she expressed on more than one occasion was genuine,” wrote Waite. “She had become a convert to Roman Catholicism in her youth and it was clear she had received considerable help from the RC prison chaplains, of whom she spoke most highly.” Waite never read the details of Brady and Hindley’s sadistic murders and intends never to do so. Theirs, he recognises, will go down in history as among the most terrible crimes in British history.  The parole she desired, he added, was never possible because infamy guaranteed no Home Secretary would ever sign papers to release her and she would’ve been a magnet for vigilantes. Conceding Hindley triggered hostility not sympathy, controversy doesn’t deter Waite. He rejects the “walking saint” tag when he displays considerable sympathy for people judged by the public, or found guilty by courts, of heinous offences. During his own captivity he’d try to cheer himself up by remembering travels with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie. The journeys are revived in a republished, whimsical memoir, Travels with a Primate, projecting the good natured humour of a now elderly man who would have every right to resent his imprisonment but prefers to seek positives in everything and the goodness in everyone. “We need to look for the best in people and try to bring it out,” he says. The son of a Cheshire policeman, who ed to Beirut to forgive those who inflicted , days of hell, he has a house in Suffolk and collects clocks. At an age when many people put their feet up, he remains involved in a campaign against homelessness, advises iniduals and families who, like himself, find themselves in hostage situations and prison reform.  Waite maintains most people behaving badly, often incredibly badly, can and will be transformedwe put the emphasis on rehabilitation instead of locking them up in nightmare prisons. Quoting official figures warning nine in every  inmates suffer psychosis, depression, alcoholism, drug addiction and other problems, he’s convinced stopping men and women offending then reoffending would be beneficial for society as a whole. “Simply to put them in an institution where they have no hope is dreadful,” says Waite. “I can sympathise, I really can,you’re broken into and your house is trashed you’re going to be fed up. “Locking people up without hope isn’t helpful. I have experience of that, five years, I know how dficult it is not being able to do anything.” Demanding radical reform of prisons, ending degrading treatment in crumbling buildings, Waite is insistent he isn’t ignoring the impact burglaries, robberies, violence and murders have on victims and families. “I’m not being soft on crime. I must emphasise that,” he says. “I don’t like crime and I think it’s really something we must combat but having said that I believe in rehabilitation.” Terry Waite’s Travels with a Primate – Around the World with Robert Runcie is republished by SPCK. pound.

Anya Behl suffers from Alternative Hemiplegia of Childhood , a neurological condition which is said to affect one in a million people. Her family are raising funds for groundbreaking gene therapy in the US. The -month-old tot experienced her first episode of AHC at  weeks old in October  and those with the lelong condition can be described as human timebombs.   Her parents Abhishek and Katherine say their lives changed forever when Anya let out a terrible scream as her eyes started to flicker - during her first episode of the condition. The couple, from Edinburgh, rushed Anya - who looked like she was having a stroke - to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. Katherine, a hospital doctor, said they thought their daughter was going to die.   She said she knew what was going on medically - but as a mother, she felt helpless. After four months of tests and thinking that Anya was suffering from epilepsy, Katherine was told her daughter had the ATPA gene. The gene is responsible for around  per cent of AHC cases. Anya is one of only two children in Scotland with the condition and there are around  families in the UK living with it and only  worldwide.  According to the Alternative Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation, the incidence of AHC is estimated at roughly one in ,, births. But they say the true incidence may be higher since the disorder is commonly misdiagnosed due to the lack of awareness about AHC. Katherine said her daughters condition has taken an emotional toll on the family, with her husband quitting his job as a travel consultant to look after Anya full time.   She said: We just have to live truly in the moment and enjoy a good hour or good day or even enjoy her being able to eat breakfast without paralysis or distress rather than think of the whole picture. At first we used to get anxious waiting for the next episode to hit not knowing what might come but we realised it wasnt sustainable to live like that. We are grateful for the moments she is well and her happy self and try not to focus on it changing in a second. We know how fragile le can be. She added: It doesnt ever leave you though and it influences every single thing we do. Even days out with their young daughter involve stringent preparation in case a seizure takes place. Katherine said: We dont leave home without her emergency medications. Our nappy bag includes her emergency meds and a paediatric face mask should we need to help support her airwayit affects her breathing.   When shes paralysed down one side, but not in her worst case, its heartbreaking to see her try to crawl when she cant balance unable to move one side or support herself. In  months at least one of us - my husband or I - have been with her   except for one hour when my mum looked after her and constantly watching her as her condition can change in a second. Now the couple is hoping to raise funds for a groundbreaking gene therapy project in the US. The pair have launched an Anya is a One in a Million fundraising campaign on their JustGiving page which has raised over pound, of a pound, target.  The money will go towards a pre-clinical, non-human trial to be conducted with the support of several AHC foundations in the US. The trial is essential before ethical approval can be sought with a view to testing the gene therapy in humans. Katherine said: Despite starting  with Anya in and out of paralysis, distress and a host of neurological symptoms, we now have real hope for advancements in AHC research.

There are some inidual MPs who work hard for their constituents and try to use their time in Parliament to improve people’s lives. But collectively they have hardly covered themselves in glory at the moment with their failure to resolve the biggest challenge facing this country in decades. If their wages were based on performance, then on Brexit alone they should have their pay docked.   We realise MPs’ pay is now set independently following the expenses scandal but it is sickening that Tories are pocketing a .% pay rise having voted to freeze the benefits of the poor, sick and vulnerable.

The region has become the deadliest place for young people in the UK, with nearly  kne crimes so far this year. MPs in Birmingham are now warning there could be civil disorder on the streets because of a perfect storm of rising youth unemployment, fewer police and cuts to council services.

Maria Gonzalez Roesch and her newlywed husband were on the Royal Caribbean cruise holiday on February  when they literally missed the boat. The Symphony of the Seas ship was docked at Nassau port, and passengers had been given an all-aboard time of .pm. At .pm, the gangway was removed and doors were closed – the couple arrived five minutes later. Footage of the couple running desperately for the ship was then shared across the world.  The video, taken from the neighbouring Norwegian Bliss cruise liner, shows them arrive, run to the front of the ship and converse with workers onboard, who presumably told them it was too late. The clip shows the pair waving their arms in hopes the ship would stop, and desperate screams of “No!” can be heard from as the vessel moves away. After three minutes, the ship starts blaring its departure horn signalling a final goodbye to the port — and the helpless couple are left behind. Maria, , explained on her Instagram that the cruise on the trip had always left at .pm but that day the ship left earlier.   The honeymooning couple had been given a new itinerary but didnt read it and assumed - wrongly - that the ship would leave on the same schedule as at other ports.

The four-year-old brother and sister, from Brisbane, share all of their mothers DNA but only a proportion of their fathers, according to a report in The New England Journal of Medicine.They were first identied as semi-identical, or sesquizygotic, using genetic testing while still in the womb. Professor Nicholas Fisk, who led the team that cared for the mother and twins at the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital in , said it was an exceptional case. It is likely the mothers egg was fertilised simultaneously by two of the fathers sperm before iding, he said.   The mothers ultrasound at six weeks showed a single placenta and positioning of amniotic sacs that indicated she was expecting identical twins. However, an ultrasound at  weeks showed the twins were male and female, which is not possible for identical twins. Identical twins develop when cells from a single egg, fertilised by a single sperm, ide into two. This means they share identical DNA and are the same sex. Non-identical twins occur when the two babies develop at the same time from separate eggs and separate sperm. Semi-identical twins come from one egg, fertilised by two sperm, which then split.   This type of fertilisation results in three sets of chromosomes. Dr Michael Gabbett, from Queensland University of Technology, said: Three sets of chromosomes are typically incompatible with le and embryos do not usually survive. In the case of the Brisbane sesquizygotic twins, the fertilised egg appears to have equally ided up the three sets of chromosomes into groups of cells which then split into two, creating the twins. Some of the cells contain the chromosomes from the first sperm while the remaining cells contain chromosomes from the second sperm, resulting in the twins sharing only a proportion rather % of the same paternal DNA. Semi-identical twins were first reported in the US in , but only came to the attention of doctors during their infancy.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray accordion and fiddle club rings in the new year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club got the New Year off to a great start at the Inveraray Inn on January .Supporting players were Fyne Folk, with Sally Hall, Alex John MacLeod, Jake MacKay on fiddles, Agnes Liddell on keyboard and were joined by Calum Satchel on fiddle.

One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency glasgow prestwick airport cessna","story":"NewsEmergency at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as Cessna plane overshoots runway after engine failureThe incident saw a Cessna  overshoot the runway following the loss of engine power.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn emergency was declared at Prestwick Airport this afternoon after a light aircraft overshot the runway.

And absolutely everything that could earn a pound was sold – including old mannequins , fashion stands and even store room shelving. The massive clear-out included giving away box loads of coat hangers. The building closes after  years of trading after current multi-millionaire owners the Jebreel family pulled the rug. As stock was snapped up in the sale, staff turned to fixtures and fittings to sell. Eight mannequins at pound each were snapped up - and some will remain gracing town windows.

The pound million screw will be positioned right on the old mill weir on the River Ayr opposite Ayrshire College. The weir originally drove an old cornmill on the site. Now tens of thousands of pounds a year will be generated by the flow of the river. Updated plans are now being considered by South Ayrshire Council, which is behind the scheme through the local Energy Agency. They show a single archimedes screw turbine at the old Nethermills Weir. Consultants Mann Power Hydro say: “Completion of this project will create a supply of renewable energy into the local distribution network, proposing firstly to sell the majority of output locally to meet the electricity demands of Ayrshire College, where the grid connection will be made. “In mitigation, the project includes a historic improvement to the passage of eels, lampreys and salmon smolts at the weir by the provision of new specialised passes for these species, and also improves upstream and downstream migration for salmon and other fish species. “It will moderate the flows into the existing passes in some conditions, which will make these less challenging. “This will help ameliorate a general problem whereby a weir is a barrier to migration of fish.” It is predicted the turbine - more than  feet in diameter and  feet long - will generate up to  kilowatts per year. The blade will turn at a maximum  revolutions per minute The Energy Agency carried out a study last year to estimate the energy potential passing over the weirs at Nethermills. It is expected the council will pocket pound, a year from selling the power and the scheme would receive a pound, feed-in-tarf. The single four-bladed screw is enough to power  homes. A report said: “With proper maintenance the scheme should continue to generate clean power for many decades after its capital cost has been repaid. “The scheme would provide an eye-catching and interesting landmark in the middle of the town, an emblem of the community’s dedication to the principle of sustainable development. A decision on approval is expected shortly.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr NewsEnvironmentScottish rivers"},{"url":null,"title":"new public park 40m leisure","story":"NewsNew public park and £m leisure centre for Ayr town centre as South Ayrshire Council announce tax hikes and teacher cutsThe plans were unveiled as part of the councils latest budget, rubber stamped at County Buildings this morning.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe park will be built on the vacant site at the bottom of the High Street \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailResidents will be hit with a maximum . per cent increase in council tax from April.

Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Mundellrsquos wan smiles and empty words about doing the best for Scotland as the Government he is a member of readies itself to push us off the no-deal Brexit clf, is as astonishing as it is appalling. He, too, should have gone months ago, not least over the manner in which his party has arrogantly steamrollered over the views and interests of the country he supposedly represents.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitRemarkably still in post, Mr Mundell now has one last chance to make a meaningful contribution to the ridiculous and dangerous situation the Westminster parliament has created for itself. The SNP is right to call for Mr Mundell to show some mettle and make clear that he will not serve in a Government that is willing to take us out of the European Union without a deal, a situation that would put the already fragile Scottish economy on the road to ruin. As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities. And despite not being a proper party - yet - or having any actual policiesit seems many voters quite like what they see.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitMomentum has grown over the weekend, with polls already putting the group on  per cent, just one behind the increasingly irrelevant Lib Dems.Many are asking whether TIG has a future. Surely, however, whatrsquos most important is the future of the country, andthis new movement serves only to facilitate the halting of Article , so that a new road out of the current mess can be found, then it will already have done more for the UK than Mr Corbyn.

Whatever they have spent the money on, it is not the set. With its purple chairs and faux art it looked like the business class lounge of a cheapo airline. The audience were in cinema-style banked seating which made the audience look tiny. Worse, some of the seats were empty.But never mind the standard of the seating, what about the quality of the debate  The audience, Jardine informed us, came from all across Scotland, ldquofrom Ayrshire to Paisley, Perth and Edinburgh.

No Greens or LibDems will it be their turn next week Marks out of  for The Nine The job of the new show, Jardine said in his introduction, was not just to get answers from politicians but to raise the standard of debate, no less. Within a minute, however, Murdo Fraser was talking over Monica Lennon and she was raising her own voice in response. So much for new standards of discourse. It was not long, either, before the politicians on the  began answering the questions that suited them rather than the ones they had been asked. Jardine pulled a Paxman now and then, possibly to shake himself awake. ldquoWhat does any of this mean, what are you going to do about it  he asked Lennon at one point.Half an hour was spent on Brexit, far too long. The next questions, on sectarianism and a possible teachersrsquo pay strike, were not matters that would have been raised on a QT from London, so in that respect Debate Night showed its worth, evennothing new emerged in the discussion.I would like to say the hour was packed with penetrating questions and illuminating answers, a show that showed QT how such programmes should be done.

Leaving the EU would represent an historic change and it is natural that some people will feel apprehensive.The MP for Camborne and Redruth said he had been open to the idea of using the UKrsquos existing membership of the European Economic Area as an exit mechanism and pointed out how he had supported Mrs Mayrsquos approach outlined at Chequers when others did not.ldquoI have stuck with the Government through a series of rather undignied retreats, he declared but noted: ldquoHowever, I fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country.Read more:Brexit deal within our grasp, claims Theresa May as she sets her face against extending Article ldquoI appreciate that you have been terribly undermined by those in Parliament who refuse to respect the referendum result.

They have deliberately made progress slow and dficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave.ldquoIf the position of Parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement, then we are somewhat stuck.

We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of lsquono-deal the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window.Mr Eustace added: ldquoI will do what I can from the back benches to try to salvage this sorry situation and I hope that, when the moment comes, Parliament will not let our country down.In response, Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, tweeted: \"Another day another resignation from the UK Government.

And yet, he told a meeting of his ruling board, he was surprised by what he had seen at Scottish grounds.Will Kerr when still in Northern IrelandSpeaking at a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority in Greenock, he said: ldquoThe vast majority of fans who go to these football matches do so entirely peacefully and just want to enjoy the wonderful spectacle that is Scottish football.ldquoBut what Irsquove been surprised at over the last six months, particularly when it comes to behaviour at football matches, has been two things.ldquoOne has been that level of sectarianism on display and I say that having policed in Northern Ireland for nearly  years.ldquoIrsquove been surprised at how much it is seen as normal... It feels almost visceral in a way I havenrsquot experienced for quite a while.Mr Kerr added: ldquoIrsquove also been surprised just at the level of disorder on display at the some of the football matches and we have been concerned, particularly over the last  months, that there has been a rise in both disorder, that type of offensive behaviour and the levels of aggression to police officers.ldquoWersquove had officers pulled off horses, spat at, attacked - very aggressive behaviour towards them.ldquoWe had a police horse which had pyrotechnic flare thrown at it a couple of weeks ago and was injured to the extent it had to go to the vet.ldquoAgain, Irsquove been surprised that the consistently thuggish behaviour of a very small number of fans is considered normal.

His remarks, he explained were based on feelings of officers policing the matches.The issue, he said, should not be left to the police. Mr Kerr said clubs, fans, and councils all need to look at what can be done dferently to change this behaviour ldquofrom being normal to being unacceptable.He said part of that will be enforcement but ldquowersquore certainly not going to arrest our way out of this.Scotland is getting outside help.

It is a work of artistic furniture sculpture, which Aberfeldy designer craftsman Angus Ross says was inspired by all that the river stands for, from its flow to the fishing.The Spey Bench which has been created from steam bent olive ash, and is priced at pound, was unveiled at the Saatchi Gallery in London for Collect, the craft sectors premier showcase, bringing together galleries, artists and collectors from around the world to present a fresh array of established and new talent.Speaking from Collect, Mr Ross said: \"Our workshop and woodland are on the banks of the River Tay and rivers are a great source of inspiration.\"Historically and psychologically rivers connect rural places to the wider world and they have a unique energy, movement and light. For this bench I turned my thoughts to the River Spey ndash famous across the globe for whisky and salmon fishing.\"Mr Ross, who is one of  makers showcased by Craft Scotland from yesterday in an exhibition running to Sunday, has built his reputation on shaping and folding timber in the same way that an artist will create a sculpture from stone.\"The Spey Bench started with the physical process of steam-bending ndash literally coaxing and pushing planks of steamed wood over formers to create the desired line,\" he explained.\"The elements were then traditionally jointed but this process was quite complex due to the angles involved. The form of the bench evokes the flowing river, the angle of the rod and the loops of line formed during fly casting.\"The creation along with those of the Craft Scotland makers received a rave review from Dr Mhairi Maxwell, assistant curator at Scotlands first design museum, the VA Dundee.He said in an article for Craft Scotland: ldquoThe makers in the Craft Scotland showcase at Collect  are the alchemists of our time carving, casting and creating new traditions, ideas of value and material possibilities across all disciplines. This showcase is craft and design at the boundaries and should not be missed!\"Drawing on a range of dferent influences and fusing together very dferent techniques, all  makers represented are working to create striking new forms and materialities which deliberately defy definition, including furniture maker Angus Ross and his super-natural use of folding and steam bendinghelliphellipIt is not the first time Mr Ross has been inspired by rivers to create new benches. The award-winning Tay Bench is a flowing ribbon of steam-bent Perthshire oak forming an arm-rest for what is a love-seat, while the Forth Bench is similarly styled from an Old Castle Wood oak and features hand-turned stretchers.After a background in product design for mass manufactured products for the British High Street - often in plastic- Mr Ross re-trained in woodwork and furniture-making to find greater job satisfaction.Based in a studio-workshop in Aberfeldy, Perthshire and a co-owner of a beautul mixed broadleaf woodland there is a now a close relationship between the two.Mr Ross says the woodland is actively managed to provide sustainable wood for furniture making, whilst improving native bio-ersity while allowing rights to roam for the public.A small section of overcrowded oak trees - generally unsuitable for traditional furniture making - led to his \"deep exploration\" of the ancient art of steam-bending.He said that each year a few trees are selectively felled \"allowing in more light to improve the growth of the remaining trees and increase ersity on the woodland floor\".He said: \"The butts are carefully assessed and selectively milled. The timber is either air-dried for steam bending or kiln dried for traditional cabinetmaking. The previously neglected veteran trees provide richly coloured characterful oak.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-set-to-call-for-power-to-hold-indyref2","story":"With the UKstill mired in negotiating a way through Brexit, sources claim there is an expectation at Westminster that the First Minister will soon request a section  order, granting the Scottish Parliament the right to hold another referendum.But it is widely expected that the answer would be no, with a member of the UK Government telling the BBC: ldquoThere is no answer to this, other than now is not the time.Some commentators believe Ms Sturgeon may even be expecting a firm rejection from Downing Street to stir the pot.But a national broadcaster has reported that, based on internal polling for the Conservatives, opposition to another referendum is hardening and one minister said: \"Once youve hit the iceberg, youre all on it together.In response, Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ldquoThe justication here from a UK Minister for trying to block Scotlandrsquos right to choose independence is quite something - lsquoonce youve hit the iceberg, youre all on it togetherrsquo.\"Well, actually, no, Scotland does not have to sink with the Brexit ship.Ms Sturgeon indicated in January that details of the timetable for a second referendum would be revealed within ldquoweeks.Opposition leaders were quick to attack the prospect of a second independence referendum.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoThere is no mandate for another isive independence referendum.

Designed to stand in Parliament Square, it was rejected due to fears it would become a target for protestors.In rejecting the effigy, Westminster councillors said the administration has a -year principle of waiting a decade after a persons death before erecting a statue, which seems far too liberal. A century would be wiser, and never wiser still.Having wholeheartedly rejected Maggies statue, the borough has re-gted it to the former prime ministers home town of Grantham.Initially, it was recommended the statue be placed on a plinth three feet high to protect it. Now, though, the ft work will sit on a granite block the same height to keep it well out of the way of politically-motivated vandals.In the interim, the statue is being held in a secret location and Im quite sure there are many who would like it to remain there, as would I. Not because its Maggie, but because its a statue.The day after the death of George Mendonsa, the US sailor famously photographed kissing a stranger at the end of World War Two, a statue depicting the moment was vandalised with #MeToo graffiti. Is vandalism ever legitimate political protest  Who cares  This is the type of trouble statues cause.The natives of Dublin have gone absolutely nuts and are erecting not only one but two statues to Luke Kelly,  years after the death of the frontman of The Dubliners. Im sure the social activist son of the city is a fine, decent man without a single metatarsal in his closet, never mind complete skeleton - but whathes not Galashiels weaver Robert Coltart is to have a statue constructed in his home town in the Scottish Borders, a monument in commemoration of the song he penned, Coulters Candy - better known as Ally Bally Bee.Isnt this a monument to capitalism  Isnt the song only about selling more of his tooth rotting product And lets not overlook another negative element of the statue... its final appearance. Pity poor Victoria Wood, whose statue has been panned for looking more like Tory MP Michael Fabricant. Your les work immortalised with a statue looking more like the passable likeness of a passport photo than a flattering commemoration.The sculptor behind a bronze bust of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo had to have a second crack at it, it bore such an appalling resemblance to the man.In Glasgow, a campaign is underway to build a statue to Benny Lynch, Gorbals boxing sweetheart, one of the best boxers Scotland has ever produced.Lynch, born in , died at the age of  from alcohol-related malnutrition, but prior to that had had an astounding career that included winning the British, European and world flyweight titles.Lynch was also a convicted child abuser and domestic abuser. He assaulted two young girls of seven and  in a Glasgow cinema, and he was convicted of assaulting his we and his -year-old sister-in-law. A charge of trying to gas his baby son over a kitchen stove was found not proven.As a society, we take the bizarre view that offences of real gravity can be overlookedthe perpetrator has sporting prowess. A talent for sport is repeatedly held up as a mitigating factor when a sportsman has been found guilty of, in particular, domestic violence or sexual assault.Bennys case is further complicated by his alcoholism. He made real efforts at rehabilitation but these all failed, not least because in the s and s we did not have the same understanding of addiction as we do now. And yet, not all alcoholics beat their wives and assault children. The drink is an excuse, not absolution.There is no nuance to a statue. A statue is unequivocal praise. Here stands Benny Lynch, proudly and with glory, a bold and brave son of Glasgow. Respected, revered. Not everyone will respect and revere him. With a museum exhibition theres the chance to give historical context and a balanced take on the man.What does one do about a statue  Install a plaque alongside  Doesnt quite cover it, does it The Hungarians have a neat solution in Budapests Memento Park. The open air museum houses monumental statues from Hungarys Communist period. Lenin, Marx, and Engels nestle in safety, remembered but removed.I dont propose an end to statue commemorations, only an alternative display area. Scotlands Memento Park.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

Further meetings are scheduled over the coming weeks.\"Regarding widespread concern about the future of the museum collection, Mr Brown said it \"remains complete and in the same safe condition while the next steps are discussed\" with the local authority.Mr Stone, the MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, described Horizons ndash which closed unexpectedly last week ndash as part of \"a string of pearls\" to entice visitors to the area, the others being the Castle of Mey and Dunrobin Castle.He urged the First Minister to help identy a way \"to keep this vital facility open\".Mr Stone said: \"I was appalled to hear of this closure ndash not least because it doesnrsquot seem that long since it was first opened. Caithness Horizons has been a great success in interpreting the geology, wildle and history of the far north for local people and visitors alike. It is up to date, visually striking, full of information and everyone who has been has come away much enthused.\"The closure of Caithness Horizons is precisely what we cannot allow to happen and it is for this reason that the Scottish Government should play its part in securing a future for the facility.\"Councillor Struan Mackie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, is concerned about public statements on dispersing the collection and says that is \"contrary to the founding principles of Horizons\".He said any part of the permanent collection not on loan \"must remain in Caithness, regardless of the future of the Horizons facility. And in the event of closure the permanent collection would revert to the Highland Council.\"Councillor Mackie says the local authority should explore alternative operating models and wants \"a cast iron commitment to ensure our countys heritage stays in Caithness for future generations.\"Ian Leith, chairman of the Wick Society, which runs Wick Heritage Museum in the townrsquos Bank Row, described the closure of Caithness Horizons as \"a great loss\".\"From a heritage point of view it is certainly important, particularly its collection which should not be broken up and dispersed,\" he said.Mr Leith emphasised that the heritage groups in Caithness are not in competition \"but telling parts of the same story\". He said: Caithness Horizons had its part to play. Now its gone it is a great loss, but hopefully it can be retrieved.\"He said the Thurso museum and gallery had \"very dedicated and very experienced staff\".Mr Leith added: \"It is too important to lose, particularly its heritage collection which has a national signicance. If it was broken up it would dilute the story.

It is shameful that it has taken a fiasco like this for the Scottish Government to sit up and take notice.\"Thankfully, the mother and both babies are healthy and we must thank the local NHS staff for their excellent work.\"However, this is a situation that neither the mother nor the staff should have been put in and we desperately need action from the Scottish Government.\"Geography and distance should not be something expectant mothers have to deal with and the government must accept that no-one should lack access to health services simply because of where they live.\"He spoke out after the womans ordeal was made public. She went to Caithness General Hospital in Wick in November after her waters broke when she was  weeks pregnant.It was decided she should go by ambulance to Raigmore in Inverness, over  miles away, to have her babies.But as she was near Golspie, her contractions became stronger and she was taken to the local community hospital, the Lawson Memorial, where she gave birth to a boy.A helicopter was then to take the woman to the Highland capital but was unable to land due to frost on its propellers so she made the rest of the journey by ambulance and gave birth to the second twin.Labours Rhoda Grant raised the case in parliament and claimed the air ambulance should have been called when the woman went into labour.She asked: \"It begs the question why was the air ambulance or emergency retrieval team not tasked initially to airlt the mum from Caithness \"Will the First Minister investigate this and will she make sure that the air ambulance treats situations like this as a priority \"Nicola Sturgeon promised to investigate and asked Scotlands health secretary, Jeane Freeman, to look into it.Bill Fernie, the chairman of Chat, said the case highlighted the groups concerns about mothers having to travel to Inverness to give birth.\"Fortunately, we have not had a tragedy yet and hopefully we never will ndash but this underlines the fears we have had since the changes were made to the local maternity unit.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupFriday  Mar  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible. Savings have to be made, but sticking rigidly to a timetable leaves little time to form development groups.Friday  Mar  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery. If that help was not there when I needed it, the outcome could have been very dferent.The other said: ldquoHearing a voice that was willing to listen to me was a relief on one of the darkest days of my le.Friday  Mar  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It’s harder to do things by halves, in a way... You’re not fully invested, so you get bogged down by the self-doubt and not knowing why you’re doing it and what choices you’re making.”He continues: “I wanted to have an authentic experience, but that meant shooting in Malawi was going to be really important. Andshooting in Malawi was going to be really important, then it felt like shooting it in a Malawian language was going to be very important.“Trying to find the right people to play the parts, and people and actors who are going to be engaged with all the complications of Chichewa and doing it in that way, felt a natural part of the process.”Ejiofor has worked with some incredibly successful directors throughout his career – Steve McQueen for  Years A Slave, Alfonso Cuaron for Children of Men, Stephen Frears for what was arguably his breakout role, in thriller Dirty Pretty Things, and, as mentioned earlier, Spielberg right at the start of his career.But while they have all been “deeply inspirational”, he stresses there must be a balance on set of trying to find your own voice with a film too.“If you are trying to borrow somebody , then the film is going to feel like you’re trying to borrow somebody ,” he elaborates.“In the end it is about trying to be honest, and to be honest to yourself and whatever \u2028your strengths are but also to what your weaknesses are, and to ‘fess up to them and \u2028try and navigate them, because all of it is very raw on screen.“It’s a very transparent medium and it really does expose the director, it exposes the writer, it exposes the actor. It’s very brutal as a format. So, you’ve just got to be as truthful to yourself as you can be.”The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind is available on Netflix from tomorrow©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s 1979 devolution plans 40 years on from the yes vote that wasn t","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...FORTY years ago devolution split the country. Scotland#s first referendum on the issue, held on March, , saw  per cent vote in favour and  per cent against - the same margin as in the UK#s  Brexit referendum.But despite the narrow win for the Yes camp, devolution did not go ahead.Scots-born London Labour MP George Cunningham had successfully proposed an amendment to the legislation saying thatless than  per cent of the whole electorate voted in favour the plans should be abandoned.The final result was Yes ,, and No ,,.The turnout was . per cent, but the Yes vote amounted to just . per cent of the total electorate.Out of Scotland’s  regions and island areas, six voted Yes and six No.Lothian had the closest result of, split almost - with , Yes and , No.Central, Fe, Highland, Strathclyde and the Western Isles also went Yes, while Borders, Dumfries  Galloway, Grampian, Tayside, Orkney and Shetland all voted No.The  devolution plans did not go as far as those which eventually became reality in the Scottish Parliament.The new Scottish Assembly would have taken charge of education, health, the environment, home affairs, legal matters and social services. It would have passed “measures” rather than “acts” but would not have had any tax powers.There would have been a Scottish Executive headed by a First Secretary and the Assembly would have met in the Old Royal High School, which had been converted and stood ready and waiting, complete with chamber.The Labour Government had been prompted to bring forward a devolution scheme by the steady advance of the Nationalists during the s.And although the proposals fell well short of independence, the SNP backed the creation of an Assembly as a step on the way.George Reid, then an SNP MP and years later Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, said in an interview with the Evening News at the time: “I have always thought you go as far as the Scots people want and I have always been against great loups forward.“It is good as it stands because it allows Scots’ decisions to be taken in accordance with Scots’ priorities and we again get a forum to decide where we are going.”The interview noted that Mr Reid believed the Assembly would be a place of “civilised legislative debate between moderate men of goodwill dedicated to Scotland’s best interests”, which might include himself and the likes of David Steel and Donald Dewar.All three were eventually leading members of the Scottish Parliament elected in .Labour’s Robin Cook, later a strong advocate of devolution, was one of the most prominent No campaigners in . He claimed that with the economic dficulties which then prevailed, the devolution debate was like fiddling while Rome burned. “Increasingly, ordinary voters find the whole business totally irrelevant to the real problems which we face in the industrial and economic field.”Regional councillor Eric Milligan, later to be Edinburgh’s Lord Provost, was another Labour politician opposed to devolution.“An Assembly is bound to take over many of the important s presently carried out by local government,” he declared. “This will simply lead to more and more centralisation of local govt and take decisions even further away from the people.“He claimed  of the  Lothian regional councillors were opposed to an Assembly. But he failed in a bid to get the council to recommend a No vote after George Foulkes - then a fellow councillor, later a Lothian MSP - persuaded the council to remain neutral.However Edinburgh District Council, as it then was, did vote : to urge people to vote No.Margo MacDonald, later one of the best-known characters in the Scottish Parliament and at that time the SNP’s senior vice-chairman, resigned as Westminster candidate for Hamilton and said she wanted to get elected to the new Assembly instead. She said the move was an act of faith and proof of her confidence of a Yes vote in the referendum.“The Scots must realise that the Assembly is not a plaything. It is essential for reform in Scotland.”The cost of the devolution project inevitably featured heavily in the No campaign.The vehemently anti-devolution West Lothian Labour MP Tam Dalyell said in a debate at the Howden Centre in Livingston: “The brutal fact is that money for paying Assembleymen, clerks, secretaries, officials, supporting staff and indeed the whole parallel civil service comes out of the same kitty as paying for the health service. Do we want more money for politicians and less money to pay hospital staff ”But SNP MP Margaret Bain - later Margaret Ewing - rebutted claims that devolution would be too expensive. She calculated the Assembly would cost p per person per week - “the price of a stick ofchewing gum”.And she added: “We reckon that over £ million of taxpayers cash has been wasted by Westminster in the past few weeks alone. This would run the assembly at current costs for more than a century.” Malcolm Rkind, who had resigned from Tory front bench in  over the party’s retreat from devolution, announced he would vote Yes - but said it was a “major flaw” that while Scotland and Wales were offered assemblies there was no change for England.A letter to the Evening News complained the proposed Assembly would be “lopsided” - “dominated by Strathclyde members and loaded against the interests of those staying in the East of Scotland”.And the Monthly Record of the Free Church of Scotland came out against devolution. “We cannot be convinced that a new public building, a new debating chamber, a new breed of politicians and a new rash of civil servants are going to make our winters one whit more bearable.”But Stephen Maxwell, director of the SNP’s referendum campaign - argued a Yes vote was crucial for Scotland’s place in the world.He said: “A No vote would confirm the suspicion of many foreigners, including potential investors, that Scotland is a country of loud boasts and little action.“A Yes vote will signal to the rest of the world that Scotland is a go-ahead society with high ambitions for the future and the self-confidence to realise them.”Towards the end of the campaign former Tory Prime Minister Lord Home announced to the Edinburgh University Conservative Association he would be voting No despite supporting devolution.He listed “defects” with the proposals, including that the Assembly would have no power to raise revenue, it would be too large with a danger of “over-government” and it was not being elected by proportional representation.And he argued it was better to wait for an improved scheme. “I think that more and more people are concerned to get the matter right, evenit means more time,” he said. A No vote need not imply any disloyalty to the principle of devolution, he claimed.As referendum day loomed closer, the Evening News reported how Gordon Brown, Labour’s devolution chairman, was due to speak in support of Yes at  meetings over three days in a “whirlwind weekend”.The future Prime Minister declared: “To be swayed now by the scaremongering and  fears peddled by the money men of the No campaign would be like scoring an own goal in the last few seconds of a big match.”As it turned out the match ended in a draw and it would be almost another two decades before Scotland got its parliament.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp set to back creation of new currency for an independent scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP is poised to adopt a new policy for an independent Scotland to establish its own currency.SNP depute leader Keith Brown revealed he and Finance Secretary Derek Mackay will put forward a motion to the party’s conference in Edinburgh next month that “it should now be party policy that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would establish an independent currency”.While Scotland would continue to use the pound in a transition period after a vote to leave the UK, Mr Brown said the use of sterling would not be “an open-ended commitment”.• : Independence would help us stop burning ‘Scotland’s oil’ – Joyce McMillanIt marks a major sht on the SNP’s stance in the run-up to the  independence referendum - when then-first minister Alex Salmond argued Scotland would continue to use the pound in a currency union with the rest of the UK.This was strongly rejected by all of the UK parties, with uncertainty over currency arrangements regarded as being one of the reasons why Scots voted against leaving the UK.Writing in The National newspaper, Mr Brown said he believed having plans for the county to move to its own currency would “maximise support for an independent Scotland”.The SNP depute leader stated: “We will propose that it should now be party policy that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would establish an independent currency.”He added until this “can be done safely and securely, our currency would continue to be the pound sterling”.It comes after a major report on the economics of an independent Scotland last year concluded a separate Scottish currency could be set upsix tests are met.• : Senior MEP says independent Scotland could ‘easily’ enter the EUAfter the  referendum, Nicola Sturgeon established the Scottish Growth Commission to produce a fresh economic blueprint for a separate ScotlandIts report, published in May , recommended Scotland should keep the pound during a transition period after any vote to leave the UK, before moving to its own currency.Mr Brown added: “The process of moving to a new currency must be managed robustly and be guided by the best interests of the Scottish people and economy - in short, it must be done at the right time, in a way that affords necessary protection for our nation’s economy and for people’s personal finances.“We propose that necessary preparations, including the work of building the institutions that we need, such as an independent central bank, would begin during the transition period.“And the aim of an SNP government would be to complete preparations in time for the newly independent Scottish Parliament, informed by assessments and information from the central bank, to take a decision on establishing a new currency by the end of its first term. “Mr Brown concluded: “I believe this approach will maximise support for an independent Scotland.“And it goes to the heart of the case for independence - providing a democratically elected independent Parliament with the means to take the best decisions for Scotland.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp accused of betrayal over new delay to devolution of welfare benefits","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The devolution in full of welfare benefits to Scotland promised after the independence referendum have been delayed until  amid claims the Scottish Government has #betrayed# Scots.Social security secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville told MSPs the delay to the Scottish successor to personal independence paymentswas to make sure the transfer of cases happens “effectively and securely”.The SNP government had pledged the benefits would be fully devolved by the end of this Parliament in . Opponents last night hit out at the delay, claiming the eight-year wait for the Smith Commission benefits to be devolved made a mockery of SNP pledges during the referendum to deliver independence in  months.Tory social security spokeswoman Michelle Ballantyne said the delay exposed the “utter hypocrisy” of SNP ministers on the issue.“For two years the SNP has slammed the Department of Work and Pensions ,” she said. “The SNP has used highly charged language on the UK government’s administration of benefits. The SNP has raised expectations and promised the earth to some of Scotland’s most vulnerable people.“After repeated promises that the new system would be up and running by the end of this Parliament, we now learn that this will just not happen – and it will be  before PIP’s successor is in place.“That is nine years since the Scotland Act that introduced the devolution of social security, from the party that claimed they could set up an independent country within  months.”Holyrood is to take control of  benefits as part of the post-referendum deal on new powers for Holyrood. This accounts for about  per cent of social security spend – roughly £ million in total.Aspects of Universal Credit, carers’ allowance, funeral expense assistance and the Young Carer Grant are among those being devolved to Holyrood as part of powers set out in the Smith Commission. This was established after the independence referendum to devolve greater to powers to Holyrood to counter demands from Nationalists.Scottish Labour social security spokesman Mark Grfin described the delay as a “betrayal”.“The SNP government has left vulnerable people at the mercy of the callous DWP and the Tories for far too long already,” he said.“Ministers must apologise to everyone in Scotland entitled to social security who is being left at the hands of the Tories.”Ms Somerville told MSPs at Holyrood that work will start on transferring people from DWP to Social Security Scotland next year.“This involves moving more than half a million cases–  per cent of people in Scotland,” she said. “Such transfers have in the past caused huge problems when DWP has migrated people within its own benefits systems.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LOVAT-V-SKYE-9.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now. Those responsible would be handed their Ps."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/whfp-mod-and-retrospective-150x150.jpg","title":"new skye gallery to bring celebrated artists studio back into","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe former studio of the late, much-loved and acclaimed artist Tommy MacKenzie was reopened as a new gallery space in Skye this week by a local businessman.Robert MacAskill, owner of the Relish Deli in Wentworth Street, Portree took on the studio following the passing of Mr MacKenzie in March last year and has decided to open it as the ‘Isle of Skye Gallery’, maintaining the space’s connection to the rich arts legacy set in place by the former Glasgow Print Studio member.Born in Shetland in , Tommy MacKenzie moved to Portree a year later and, after attending the local high school, he went on to study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee.

I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer.

Alan Murray thanked them for their generosity and emphasised the importance of the new venture.“Last year in Northern Ireland there were almost  out of hospital cardiac arrests: an average of four a day. Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillation within  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Braid Valley Community First Responders aims to train and organise local people to respond to cardiac arrests in their own community while the ambulance is on its way and improve survival rates in Broughshane and Ballymena and the surrounding rural areas. This generous donation will be of great help to us in achieving our aim.”Stephen Lamont issued an appeal for local residents to ensure that their addresses were identiable.“Clear signage is vitalwe are to get to you quickly in a le threatening emergency. “Our plea is that you identy your house number or name clearly so that it can be read from the road. “ If you live up a shared drive, please talk to your neighbours and label the end of the drive with all the house numbers and ensure that each inidual house is numbered. “This will help us to help youyou are having an emergency.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1462209.jpg--.jpg?1550660974000\n","title":"moy park general manager shines a light on factory life","story":" AARON Whiteman has been with Moy Park for almost  years, working his way up from weekend sht worker to front line manager, to his current role as General Manager at the Ballymena site. As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lagmore bus service has been partially reinstated","story":"A vital bus service that was pulled from the Colin area last Tuesday night – due to a spate of anti-social behaviour and attacks on Translink drivers – was reinstated last night.The Andersonstown News reported last week how Sinn Féin Councillor Danny Baker was “fighting” to save the much needed d feeder service to Mount Eagles after it was taken off around pm last Tuesday night after five youths smashed a rear window of a bus inspector’s car and tried to pull at the doors of passing buses.

We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again.

The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm.

And, it was just before his arrival in Derry for the visit that he learned of the surfacing of the British document in question.In August,  Martin Galvin led a group of  Americans on a fact-finding tour of the North organised by Sinn Fein. The tour included a two-day tour of Derry.The arrival of the U.S. delegation attracted major press coverage in Ireland and America. The visit also coincided with the annual anti-internment rallies after which British Minister Nicholas Scott, a close associate of Margaret Thatcher, issued a public statement saying he regretted not being given the opportunity to speak to the U.S. contingent and set them straight.Martin Galvin said: \"We immediately replied that were still in the north and were willing and available to meet with the British official.\"But, Scott was immediately recalled back to London from Belfast and a statement was released that British officials did not speak to anyone affiliated with Irish Northern Aid, or who believed that IRA resistance to British rule at the time and in those circumstances was morally legitimate.\"However, Unioinist MP Martyn Smyth appeared with me on a UTV program and said our tour represented a blinkered view of the conflict because the delegation hadnt met with British officials or unionists.\"The following year, Martin Galvin, by then editor of an Irish-American newspaper in New York, organised a second tour which this time consisted of  Americans. It was again planned to coincide with an anti-interment rally on August , .Martin Galvin continued: \"On July ,  I wrote a letter from my office at the Irish People, offering the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and unionist leaders an opportunity to speak to us at a mutually agreed time and venue. It was a genuine offer made in response to both Nicholas Scotts and Rev Smyths public comments the year before.\"However, the British response to the offer to talk was to have then Home Secretary Leon Brittan issue an Exclusion Order against Martin Galvin at Cabinet level on the eve of the American delegations arrival in Ireland.\"Its been speculated that the ban was payback because I was in charge of American support for the hunger strikers in . But, a pretext was also added that months before at the rededication of the United Irishmen Roddy McCorley monument in Toome I had made a fairly commonplace remark that I was glad there were still men and women who carried on in the spirit of Roddy McCorley to be free,\" Martin Galvin said.However, the recent emergence of a previously classied Northern Ireland Officememo dated July ,  makes no reference to an exclusion order nor any concerns about allegedly inflammatory remarks in support of the IRA campaign from Galvin.The Exclusion Order against the American was however issued the next day-July , .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe NIO memo, signed by a JM Lyon, states: \"You may have seen that Martin Galvin had secured some publicity for his request to the Secretary of State and the Unionist parties for a meeting with the NORAID party when they visit Northern Ireland next month.\"I suggest the letter receive a short Private Secretary reply.\"I suggest Mr Barriemight inform Washington of this correspondence and let them know the terms of our reply when it has been sent.\"I suggest we do not ourselves issue the text to the press either here or in America, but should make it availableasked with the thought that this is a propaganda ploy at its most transparent.\"In view of the imminence of the visit, it would be helpfulcolleagues could let me have any comments, by telephone inconvenient, by close of business on  July.\"Martin Galvin said: \"Instead of intimidating or silencing the delegation the ban had the opposite reaction. Sinn Fein leaders had learned of the ban and told me it was important that I defied it because it would highlight censorship.\"I agreed to defy the ban and I was photographed in Derry beside Martin McGuinness to prove Id been in the North.\"When we went onto Belfast on August , the RUC had planned a brutal retaliation. Gerry Adams called me onto the  to speak at the anti-internment rally the RUC immediately fired plastic bullets and baton charged a peaceful crowd. They murdered Sean Downes and injured many more.\"But, like Bloody Sunday, the number of cameras, journalists and witnesses meant that British violence couldnt be covered up.\"The following year, , Galvin again defied the ban and appeared in Derry once more carrying the coffin of an IRA member.And, in August  on the th anniversary of the arrival of British troops in Derry, Martin Galvin was arrested at Free Derry Corner whilst accompanied by Martin McGuinness.After being held at Strand Road RUC barracks he was shipped to a military base in England before being deported to Washington on a British military aircraft.\"It after this incident that the British Government announced that the Exclusion Order was being withdrawn. Ironically, I was told of this by Denis Donaldson who had been sent to America and who was obviously targeting me.\"Speaking of the -year-old episode, Martin Galvin told the Derry News: \"The ban against me was simply one more of the countless examples of British officials imposing petty and arrogant policies behind some noble cover story and then being surprised that anyone would refuse to bow to their edicts.\"We were trying to show Americans what British rule was like for nationalists in the six counties.\"I think its ironic that I was made aware of this British document just as I was traveling to Derry with another American delegation. When we met in the Guildhall with eight councillors and Deputy Mayor Derek Hussey, I referred to the memo and noted that the last time I brought an American delegation to the north and requested a meeting with the British and unionists I had been sent an Exclusion Order in reply.\"CAPTION: Martin Galvin being arrested by the RUC at Free Derry Corner in . The late Martin McGuinness can be seen on the fringe of the left handside of the phoptograph."},{"url":null,"title":"mobuoy toxic dump clean dependent funding says government department","story":"A government department has said that remediation works at the Mobuoy Road “toxic super dump” in Derry will not commence unless funding is secured.The comments made by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairscome ahead of a scheduled community meeting at Drumahoe Primary School on March  at which people have been encouraged to demand answers and a clean-up of the site after years of inaction.The Mobuoy Road waste site consists of two distinct parcels of land, namely the City Industrial WasteSite and the Campsie Sands and Gravelssite – situated .km east of Derry and occupying a signicant  hectares of land – the equivalent of  rugby pitches.It has been acknowledged by environmental experts that the illegal dump poses serious risks to the River Faughan, which runs alongside it, and supplies % of the city’s drinking water.Eamonn McCann has been vocal about the urgent need for a clean-up operation over the years and raised Mobuoy in his first speech at Stormont as an MLA.  He also said that people were aware of illegal activities at the site.Yesterday, Mark H.

Its time to get Justice for Mobuoy!”‘Subject to funding’When asked what would need to be done to make the area safe and prevent any risk of contaminating the DAERA said would be dependent on funding.A spokesperson explained: “The Northern Environment Agency has agreed an integrated approach for remediating the Mobuoy illegal waste sites that takes full account of the need to protect the River Faughan.“At this stage DAERA through the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, is seeking to enforce the former operators to remediate. In parallel to this, DAERA is developing a signicant business case to support remediation of the site.“The solution is not a simple one. The protection of the River Faughan needs to be managed through a remediation programme that comprises of several complementary phases in which there are a number of treatments on site within each phase of works. All elements of this programme will need to be supported by an extensive environmental monitoring programme.“At this stage, the remediation programme is subject to DAERA securing funding for the preparatory works required prior to remediation commencing on site.”Further detail will be presented by NIEA to the local community at an event on Wednesday th March at .pm in Drumahoe Primary School.Photo: Environmental Campaigners Paul Hughes  Eamonn ODonnell at the Environmental Gathering rally in Derry last October."},{"url":null,"title":"people profit accuses sinn fein touch reality welfare reforms","story":"People Before Profit has accused Sinn Féin of being out of touch with the reality of welfare reforms.People Before Profit candidate for Foyleside Shaun Harkin said Universal Credit has left people in debt and poverty, while denying thousands disability benefits.He commented: \"Sinn Féin MLA Karen Mullan has called for the Department of Communities to ensure welfare mitigations continue.

As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier.

He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Long Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch

The current EA consultation needs to cease with immediate effect.. A temporary solution needs put in place consisting of modular buildings on the Lurgan Junior High School site with the Senior High continuing to run causing no change in teaching contracts and transition but a reduction in running costs. . A strategic group be formed consisting of an impartial chair, principals , parents, community, businesses, politicians and any other key stakeholders to look at implementing a long term Lurgan

other solution that fundamentally retains the children in Lurgan, retains the Dickson Plan with selection at aged  and ultimately provides high quality educational opportunities for vocational and academic young people.“Each of these options needs looked at primarily with the educational opportunities for the children being to the fore, the out-workings of change to teaching posts with avoidance of any disruption to teaching staff and transition of children and cannot undermine the Dickson Plan. “There needs to be clear head space and unity to resolve this matter and to that end I

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
