She’s in the business, and she’s very, very mean. I stay away from her at all costs.I never say hello to her. ‘Her siblings are not mean like she is. It’s just her.

This trend is being driven by older workers, says Jake Finney, economist at PwC, with the 50-64 group accounting for more than half of this increase since the pandemic started. Resolution Foundation agrees, saying ‘Covid retirees’ are leaving their jobs. This chart shows the rise in long-term sickness (the lime-green columns). Stephen Evans, chief executive of Learning and Work Institute, says some people are leaving to care for others, as well as retiring or being ill themselves. But, Pat McFadden MP, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, highlights that last month’s spring statement failed to give as much support as hoped for strugging households. That reflects the jump in banker bonuses, after business boomed in 2021. Here’s his summary on the jobs report: That suggests that firms have been raising wages to attract and retain staff, as workers are hit by rising prices. The UK’s unemployment rate has dropped further below its pre-pandemic levels as employers struggle to hire staff, and more people drop out of the labour force. This increase was driven by those who are economically inactive because they are looking after family or home, retired, or long-term sick, the ONS explains. Companies did add more staff, with 35,000 more people in payrolled employment in March than in February. But while the number of full-time employees increased during the latest three-month period, this was offset by a decrease in part-time employees, as this chart shows: Job vacancies hit a new record over the quarter, jumping to 1,288,000. But the rate of growth in vacancies continued to slow down. There were 50,200 new openings added in January to March 2022 compared with the previous quarter, the slowest rise in almost a year. The largest increase was in human health and social work, which increased by 13,100 to a new record of 215,500 vacancies. More details to follow.... That would be the fastest pace since 1981, and probably spur the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates aggressively over the coming months.

Photograph: Tom HonanDún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is facing a Government intervention over its contentious move to block new homes being built in the south Dublin suburbs of Killiney and Dalkey, as a row intensifies over the future of some of the most valuable lands in the State.Planning regulators objected to the ban, arguing it was “an unnecessary restriction” on sustainable development. But councillors refused to remove the measure from their 2022-28 development plan, in defiance of the regulator’s statutory recommendations to overturn it. Now regulator Niall Cussen has asked Minister of State for local government Peter Burke to issue formal directions to the council compelling it to take action over breaches of such recommendations. The development plan says “significant parts” of Dalkey and Killiney are characterised by low density development, adding that “no increase in the number of residential buildings will normally be permitted” in some areas. In correspondence to the Minister late last week, Mr Cussen has also asked him to issue directions over new restrictions on buy-to-let apartments in the development plan. The regulator opposed measures that require three-bedroom apartments to be built in 40 per cent of the units in build-to-rent schemes in “new residential communities”.Mr Burke is understood to be preparing to issue draft directions on both counts in coming days, meaning the matter will go back to the council. That move essentially means the council will have to reopen the development plan it adopted last month, after 18 months of debate.The Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) was established in 2019 to provide independent oversight of the planning process. One of its functions is to assess development plans to ensure they properly apply national policies.City and county councils around the State are in the process of adopting a new wave of development plans, which sets the framework for housing and other developments for the rest of the decade.Mr Cussen’s call for a ministerial direction in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown plan is his sixth. He previously asked the Minister to intervene in the plans of Cork County Council and the councils in Kilkenny, Laois, Meath and Westmeath. Asked about the regulator’s decision on its plan, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council said any notification seeking a ministerial direction goes to the Minister and not it as the planning authority. “The Minister then has two weeks in which to issue notice of any intention to issue a direction to the planning authority. That further two-week period has not yet passed,” the council said.The regulator’s office had no comment on its decision, which follows a four-week review of the development plan. Any ministerial direction “commences a process by the local authority, including public consultation, after which the OPR further considers the matter with a view to recommending, or not, that the Minister issue a final direction” on the plan.“The OPR works proactively with local authorities in the deliberations on their plans to ensure the best outcomes for communities which are consistent with regional and national planning policies.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"An Irishman and a local joined forces to build a surfing community at the beach in Bureh\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"frances populist revolt coming","story":"What did they mean by that? The French public has delivered a first-round result in their presidential election that leaves political nerds unable to reach a consensus about where events are likely to go from here.On the one hand, a four-point margin for the incumbent Emmanuel Macron over Marine Le Pen was bigger than some polls had predicted. The Western world’s “centrist dad” brigade might have been inclined to breathe a sigh of relief and claim there is no discernible path to victory for Madame Le Pen in the second-round run-off in a fortnight’s time.But the centrist dads have been wrong before – about Brexit, about Donald Trump and about Britain’s 2019 general election, to cite just a few recent examples. There is at least as strong a case for looking at yesterday’s result and concluding that the establishment-minded centre cannot hold and that it is now not a question of whether there will be a populist Right takeover of the apparatus of government in France, but merely of when.For a start, there is a simple comparison to be made with the first-round vote of five years ago. Back then the charismatic insurgent Macron won 24 per cent, to Le Pen’s 21 per cent. Half a decade has added an unspectacular two or three percentage points to the vote shares of both and the same to Jean-Luc Melenchon, the far-Left populist who scored 19.5 per cent five years ago and 22 per cent last night.But look at what has happened to the traditional establishment parties of centre-Left and centre-Right, the Socialists and the Republicans. Five years ago the former was thought to be at its lowest possible ebb when its candidate won just six per cent, while the latter was deeply disappointed with a 20 per cent share. Last night those scores slumped to two per cent and five per cent respectively.So France is in a vigorously anti-establishment mood and it is hard to see how five years of incumbency and presidential peacocking will enable Macron to harness that as well as he did in 2017. There is a widespread feeling that he is a “president of the rich” with an entourage dominated by privileged young Parisians swanning around in made-to-measure suits and harbouring luxury liberal beliefs.Le Pen, by contrast, has sought out the populist sweet spot of being to the Right on cultural issues and to the Left on economic ones. Her campaign has taken her around the market towns of France, speaking to the common people who formed the bulk of the “Gilet Jaune” protestors and who care more about the price of petrol than the high politics of EU summits or even the suffering of Ukraine.In the first round this time, Le Pen has not only established a strong lead among working class voters but also among the young, with a radical plan to scrap income tax for the under-30s being the core of of her economic offering.Macron himself appears to understand that he will not win the run-off as a conventional capital city centrist given the current public mood and last night pledged to represent the aspirations of those who voted for Le Pen and her fellow Right populist Eric Zemmour, the bulk of whose seven per cent vote share is surely currently heading her way.The decisive factor now will be where the voters of Melenchon end up. Many despise the values of the Paris-based elites just as much as Le Pen’s supporters do and many also are firmly traditionalist on social and cultural matters. Last night Melenchon did Macron a favour by urging them not to vote for Le Pen, though he could not bring himself to endorse the French president.The next two weeks will see French elites attempt to kill Le Pen’s ambitions in the usual way – using her surname and previous leadership of the Front National against her, as well as her unwise past praise for Vladimir Putin, in a bid to persuade voters that she is simply not a respectable choice.But Macron himself seems to understand that, barring Le Pen malfunctioning disastrously again in a televised debate as she did last time, this will not be enough. During his first term Macron has tried hard to keep onboard voters who are anxious about the state of French society and has made a series of speeches about enforcing integration into the French way of life for migrant communities.If he holds on in two weeks’ time – as he is just about favourite to do – it will surely be because he remains a sufficiently canny campaigner to keep one foot in the populist camp himself rather than because the French public are gravitating back towards establishment norms.Nobody expects anything like the crushing two-to-one drubbing he gave Le Pen in the run-off last time. Even if they beat her this time, how the French establishment would fend her off again in 2027 is very difficult to see.More from NewsPrincess Anne greeted by traditional performances at Papua New Guinea schoolPolitics latest news: Crispin Blunt under pressure to withdraw claimRussia-Ukraine latest news: All options on table if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, minister warnsBritons facing \u0026#3912 months\u0026#39 of travel delays due to staff shortagesLondon local elections 2022: When are they, why is this year significant and how to vote?Local Elections 2022: What is up for election, where, and how to voteMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gallery highlights male gaze manet masterpiece woke attempt","story":"The “male gaze” in a Manet masterpiece has been highlighted by the Courtauld Gallery after curators introduced new labels addressing “misogyny” in art.The London gallery, which holds the UK’s foremost Impressionist collection, reviewed the labelling of all of its paintings as part of a three-year, £57 million refurbishment. Some information panels now address issues like artists’ racism and sexism.Manet\u0027s masterpiece, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, has been reinterpreted with a new label which suggests that the painting has an “unsettling” quality, because of the presence of a man on the canvas.The 1882 work depicts a barmaid staring out at the viewer of the painting and - in a mirrored image - towards a male patron of the eponymous Folies-Bergère (a Parisian cabaret club) who returns her gaze.The female subject’s “enigmatic expression is unsettling”, a new information panel states, “especially as she appears to be interacting with a male customer”.The suggestion that an “unsettling” quality of the painting is enhanced because the woman talking to a man has been criticised for unwitting “misogyny”, because it diminishes the position of the female model in the work.Ruth Millington, a historian whose book Muse chronicles the female inspirations for great art, said: “It completely shifts the viewer’s attention away from her and onto the man in the picture.“This interpretation, in a woke attempt to call out misogyny, unwittingly centres the male gaze. The writer implies that the woman is unsettled by the man’s presence, framing her as a passive victim of her circumstances.“Curators must stop trapping female muses and models with male-centred interpretations such as this.“In a painting of multiple gazes, it’s unfair and misogynistic to emphasise the male perspective. I’d rather read a fresh new label which invites viewers to imagine what the woman is thinking.”The model Manet used for the painting was a real-life woman called Suzon who worked at the Folies-Bergère, a venue frequented where prostitutes plied their trade, and it has been suggested that a subtext of the painting is the exploited barmaid’s availability to male customers, along with the alcohol she is selling.The Courtauld holds the UK’s leading collection of Gauguin works, but the French painter known for his time in Tahitian subjects - and teenage brides -  has now been reappraised by curators for “taking advantage of his position as a European coloniser”.A label on his Post-Impressionist work Nevermore states the painting depicts “one of several teenagers that he took on as ‘wives’”, adding that “the widespread racist fantasy of Tahitian girls as sexually precocious led to their unabashed exploitation”.An information panel for his 1897 painting Te Rerioa now informs visitors that its subject matter was intended to “appeal to a white European audience” by “exoticising” Polynesians.Further information on Gauguin’s memoir Avant et Apres - recently acquired by the Courtauld - states that the 213-page manuscript is “peppered with examples of his own racism and misogyny”.The treatment of other cultures as “primitive” has also been addressed in a new label for the self-portrait of Roger Fry, the Bloomsbury group painter, known for his advancement of Gauguin-inspired “Primitivism” in Western art.Updated information on the portrait states: “For modernist artists and writers, African art belonged to an earlier stage of civilisation known as “primitivism ““This reveals the reactive ideas of the time, which underpinned even the views of progressives like Fry.”The Courtauld’s relabelling comes following widespread reassessment of problematic artists, with the Picasso Museum in Paris recently inviting artists to critique the painter’s personal life, and the National Gallery highlighting Gauguin’s sexual proclivities in a 2019 show.Manet has also faced reappraisal over works like Olympia, a bold nude that scandalised the Paris Salon in 1865, and which has invited more recent criticism at the Musée d’Orsay for its sidelining of a black woman in the painting.The Courtauld has been contacted for comment.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: All options on table if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, minister warnsPrincess Anne greeted by traditional performances at Papua New Guinea schoolPolitics latest news: Crispin Blunt under pressure to withdraw claimBritons facing \u0026#3912 months\u0026#39 of travel delays due to staff shortagesLondon local elections 2022: When are they, why is this year significant and how to vote?Local Elections 2022: What is up for election, where, and how to voteMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"spare easter motorists misery issuing national injunction oil","story":"Injunction applications are being prepared by ministers to halt environmental protesters targeting oil supplies in an attempt to head off Easter travel chaos.Suella Braverman, the Attorney General, is understood to have held a meeting with ministers on Monday night as they drew up plans with local councils for a series of injunctions to target the key activists.It is expected inidual injunctions will be served within days on the key protesters who have been holding up fuel supplies by targeting three crucial depots in Warwickshire, Hertfordshire and Essex. They also blocked two central London bridges on Sunday in a series of “dangerous” stunts.Holidaymakers fleeing London for the Easter weekend face a double-whammy of environmental protests and rail upgrade works. After a week of delays and cancellations at airports and ferry ports, Extinction Rebellion is planning to bring parts of central London to a standstill over the weekend. Emergency plans are being drawn up for UK airports, with border guards from Scotland and Northern Ireland offered bonuses to work at Heathrow security desks. Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Service Union, said backroom staff who normally check prohibited items will be on the front lines to prevent disruption. She told The Daily Mail: “They get expenses and overtime and they’re being offered a cash bonus for each shift they cover at Heathrow. Some passengers will sail through, but others could be looking at several hours in a queue. It won’t be chaos universally but there will be patches.”Labour on Monday called for immediate nationwide injunctions, similar to those that brought a halt to Insulate Britain protests on motorways and roads across England.Steve Reed, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, said the Government needed “to stop standing idly by and put an end to this disruption that is causing misery for motorists.”Some 1,200 out of 8,378 pumps are shut, with one in three petrol stations in southern England forced to close, according to Campaign for Fair Fuel.The chaos by activists from Just Stop Oil comes ahead of a record 21.5 million motorists preparing to take to the roads this coming Easter weekend.Downing Street signalled the crackdown on Monday morning when the Prime Minister’s deputy spokesman said: “Protest is a cornerstone of our democracy but we will not tolerate guerilla tactics that disrupt people going about their day-to-day business.”The spokesman added: “We fully support the police who are putting significant resources into their response to the demonstrations.”Essex Police has arrested more than 350 protesters since the disruption started on April 1 but the campaign group said some of its activists were still locked on to pipework at an oil terminal in Grays on Monday.Warwickshire Police said there had been 34 arrests over the weekend linked to protests at the Kingsbury oil terminal, where protesters have tunnelled under a major access route.Two of the eco-activists – Nathan McGovern, 22, and Louis McKechnie, 21 – posted a video in which they talk about having been chained to pipes at the Grays oil depot for more than a day and breathing in asbestos as a result.“We’ve been up here over 30 hours, haven’t slept, haven’t felt safe, had a panic attack a while back, it’s really uncomfortable,” said McKechnie.Ministers hope to emulate their eventual success against Insulate Britain, which saw protesters jailed for breaching the nationwide injunction introduced by the Government.Rachel Nolan, Essex’s assistant chief constable, said: “Anyone who attends any location and wants to conduct a peaceful protest in a public area will be allowed to do so in a responsible, respectful and meaningful way.“But we have been dealing with people who are trespassing into restricted areas holding flammable chemicals, posing dangers to themselves and others and it’s totally unacceptable.”The force said that policing protests in Thurrock has cost Essex Police “in excess of £1 million”.At the same time, campaigners have also urged Network Rail and Transport for London to “get real” over their “crackers” plan to upgrade parts of the network during the busiest weekend for travel since the start of the pandemic.Network Rail is carrying out 530 upgrade projects over the bank holiday weekend, including HS2 works at London Euston.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: All options on table if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, minister warnsPrincess Anne greeted by traditional performances at Papua New Guinea schoolPolitics latest news: Crispin Blunt under pressure to withdraw claimBritons facing \u0026#3912 months\u0026#39 of travel delays due to staff shortagesLondon local elections 2022: When are they, why is this year significant and how to vote?Local Elections 2022: What is up for election, where, and how to voteMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britons facing 12 months travel delays due staff shortages","story":"Travellers are facing up to 12 months of delays at Britain’s airports and ports as the travel industry struggles to recruit enough people to fill vacancies, industry experts have warned.Kully Sandhu, the managing director of the Aviation Recruitment Network, told the BBC’s Today Programme that it will take “at least the next 12 months for the industry, vacancy wise, to settle down.”Thousands of people heading abroad for the Easter holidays have been warned they face long queues, delays and cancellations.Manchester Airport, along with others, has warned that long waits at security could continue as it struggles with staff shortages, with some passengers facing queues of 60 to 90 minutes over the next few weeks.Industry leaders have said the lack of staff is the primary cause of the issue, the both the pandemic and Brexit leading to a shortage of workers.“Brexit has not helped because we had a natural attraction of iniduals from the European market who would apply for vacancies in UK airports. We no longer have that talent pool, and we are relying on iniduals in the UK,” Mr Sandhu told the BBC. “It makes it very difficult for recruiters to recruit these iniduals because we are all fighting for the same type of candidates.”Those returning to the UK this week will also face the misery of long queues as Border Force have warned they too have a lack of staff available to check inbound passengers.Lucy Moreton, the General Secretary of the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that the agency was struggling with a chronic shortage of officers.“For the first time in living memory, Border Force isn’t attracting the number of candidates to fill the vacancies they’ve got,” she said.Ms Moreton warned that this, combined with the particularly large numbers of people travelling over the school holidays, would mean “the queues will move from security based outbound, to Border Force based coming in.”Last month, Heathrow Airport recorded its busiest month since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with 4.2 million passengers passing through the terminal, an eight-fold increase from the same month in 2021. That figure is expected to rise again this month owing to the Easter holidays as well as the government’s removal of all pandemic-era travel restrictions.However, both Mr Sandhu and Ms Moreton rejected calls for security checks to be loosened during the hiring process, saying the checks were vital to protect the UK’s national security.“You don’t expect your police officer to be incompletely trained or not security cleared and we certainly wouldn’t want anything else for Border Force.” “More resources would enable those checks to get through quicker, but we can’t cut corners on the training so we are looking at a very difficult summer.”More from NewsPrincess Anne greeted by traditional performances at Papua New Guinea schoolPolitics latest news: Crispin Blunt under pressure to withdraw claimRussia-Ukraine latest news: All options on table if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, minister warnsLondon local elections 2022: When are they, why is this year significant and how to vote?Local Elections 2022: What is up for election, where, and how to votePink Moon 2022: when it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"river oxford becomes second england achieve bathing water status","story":"A stretch of the Thames will become the second designated river bathing spot in England after record levels of support. The Wolvercote Mill Stream in north Oxford will be regularly monitored for harmful bacterial levels during the swimming season between May and September. The decision came after a campaign by locals who want the monitoring to lead to cleaner water at the spot. The consultation had 1,267 responses, with just seven not in favour of designating the site, a record level. The river has an average of 46 swimmers a day during the peak season, but tests have found levels of e-coli bacteria exceeding the threshold level for safe bathing water quality.The designation does not guarantee clean water, but is expected to put pressure on Thames Water and local landowners to stop pollutants entering the area and will enable locals to know when it is safe to swim. A 2021 study of local river water quality found no stretch of water in Oxford would be classified as fit for bathing, with the main cause being raw sewage overflows. Raw sewage was discharged for over 1,500 hours from five overflow locations in Oxford, according to data from the Environment Agency. England has only one other river with designated bathing status, a stretch of the River Wharfe at Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which was rated “poor” for water quality after tests in January found evidence of human and animal bacteria. Claire Robertson, Oxford Rivers Project Officer at Thames21, said: “I’m overjoyed this designation is going ahead. This stretch of river is a regularly used and treasured place for hundreds of people - families, swimmers, kayakers, rowers, anglers, birdwatchers - and a home for many other creatures, and this is the very least it deserves.“I’m looking forward to working locally with Thames Water and other partners to ensure the water quality improves, and nationally to help other groups protect their local rivers.”The East Cowes Esplanade on the Isle of Wight will be added to the list of designated bathing spots, which includes coastal waters. MPs have called for water companies to ensure that at least one stretch of river in each of their areas is monitored by 2025.Polling for The  earlier this year found that more than 80 per cent of people expect to be able to safely swim in a local river, despite officials from the Environment Agency insisting they are not intended for human use.“While bathing water quality has improved in recent years and England now has the cleanest bathing waters since records began, we know that water quality at these sites won’t change overnight. “It will take time and all those with a role to play must commit to achieve the necessary improvements,” said Rebecca Pow, Environment Minister.“We are continuing to drive up the quality of lakes, rivers and seas for the public to enjoy through the measures in our Environment Act, and I would encourage more applications for popular bathing areas, both inland and coastal, that may also be suitable for designation.”More from NewsPrincess Anne greeted by traditional performances at Papua New Guinea schoolPolitics latest news: Crispin Blunt under pressure to withdraw claimRussia-Ukraine latest news: All options on table if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, minister warnsBritons facing \u0026#3912 months\u0026#39 of travel delays due to staff shortagesLondon local elections 2022: When are they, why is this year significant and how to vote?Local Elections 2022: What is up for election, where, and how to voteMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"5 questions rishi sunak must","story":" questions Rishi Sunak must answer as he demands probe into his own conductMr Sunaks family finances have been in the spotlight since it emerged his we Akshata Murty had non-domicile tax status, allowing her to legally avoid paying UK taxes on overseas incomethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video rishi-sunak-faces-whole-list-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:XFaEYxXv,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Downing Street confirmed that Boris Johnson had ordered his ethics adviser Lord Geidt to probe the Chancelloraposs conduct after a request from Mr Sunak himself.Mr Sunakaposs family finances have been in the spotlight after it emerged that his we Akshata Murty had non-domicile tax status, allowing her to legally avoid paying UK taxes on overseas income. She U-turned on Friday to save her husbandaposs job by vowing to pay UK tax on herforeign income, which includes an estimated £. million-a-year in shares from the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her billionaire father Narayana Murty. Mr Sunak attempted to defuse the row by asking Lord Geidt to investigate, as he said he was confident he had declared everything properly. The Prime Ministeraposs deputy spokeswoman said: Iaposm not aware of whether Lord Geidt himself has begun his work. But I can confirm that the Prime Minister has agreed to the request from the Chancellor for Lord Geidt to undertake this work. Here are some of the questions the Chancellor needs to clear up. How much has his we saved in UK tax through non-dom status  Mr Sunakaposs nightmare week began when it emerged that his we held non-dom status, potentially saving her millions of pounds in tax. The arrangement, which is legal, allows people who are domiciled abroad to avoid paying UK tax on their overseas income. Her spokeswoman initially tried to claim it was because she was an Indian citizen but she then admitted that Ms Murty paid the British Government £,-a-year to keep the status.Ms Murty was forced to into a U-turn on Friday and said she would now pay UK tax on her foreign income. This includes a .% stake in Indian IT giant Infosys, founded by her billionaire father Naranya Murty. Her share is worth an estimated £ million and provides around £. million in idends per year. Under non-dom rules, Ms Murty was not obliged to pay UK tax on this income - and it is unclear how big her tax bill could have been.The BBC estimated she would have saved £. million in UK tax based on these figures.Ms Murty remains domiciled in India where she eventually wants to . What did Rishi Sunak declare about it  Mr Sunak is understood to have declared his weaposs tax status to the Cabinet Office when he first became a minister in . Sources said the Treasury was also aware, so as to manage any potential conflicts of interest. However, what happened after he made the declaration is not clear, because her status is not on his public declaration of ministerial interests.  Mr Sunak has asked for Lord Geidt to review all his declarations of interest since he became a minister in  to ensure they had been properly stated. He said he was confident he had acted appropriately at all times, but his overriding concern was that the public should have confidence in the answers. Guidance to ministers says the list is not an account of all the interests or financial arrangements held by a Minister or members of their close family, adding: Rather it is a list of any such interests, which are, or might reasonably be perceived to be, directly relevant to that particular minister’s public duties. Why did he hold a US green card until last year  Mr Sunak confirmed on Friday that he held a US green card for more than a year while he was Chancellor. A spokeswoman said he sought guidance ahead of his first US trip in a Government capacity in October - despite taking on the top Treasury job in February . People with green cards are treated as lawful permanent residents by US tax authorities, and it is seen as a step towards full citizenship.  Mr Sunakaposs spokeswoman said he filed US tax s, but specically as a non-resident, in full compliance with the law. The Sunaks met at Stanford University and worked in the US before moving to the UK to pursue Mr Sunakaposs political career. They are understood to have a holiday home in Calornia.At a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson said he was unaware of Mr Sunak holding a US green card, but stressed that the Chancellor had done absolutely everything he was required to do. Is he a beneficiary in tax havens  The Independent reported on Friday that Mr Sunak was listed as the beneficiary of trusts set up in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands to help manage the tax and business affairs of Ms Murtyaposs family interests. But a spokeswoman close to the Sunak family said: No-one in Akshataaposs family is aware of this alleged trust. Labour called on Mr Sunak to explain the situation.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: We need full disclosure now. Has he broken the ministerial code  Labour has accused the Chancellor of breaking the ministerial code, the set of guidelines that top politicians must follow.It states that outside interests must be reported to the Permanent Secretary of their department. It is understood Mr Sunak did report his weaposs status to the Cabinet Office and the Treasury was also aware. The ministerial code says the register of interests should also cover interests of the ministeraposs spouse or partner and close family which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. Lord Geidt will examine this as part of his investigation. Politicians who break the ministerial code are traditionally expected to resign.

Fishy Rishi is a beached Chancellor without credibility, struggling to survive and contemplating resignation over the Rishi Notax scandal. The nets trawling the sordid financial affairs of his incredibly wealthy family may yet produce another jaw-dropper that will force the Tory moneybags to resign in disgrace. And the morally corrupt Prime Minister he’s now unlikely ever to succeed – charlatan Boris Johnson, who presided over widespread law-breaking during Covid, his head on the chopping block until Putin spared him – remains a rotten man. Downing Street’s decaying neighbours represent a Conservative government decomposing rapidly, with ministers mocked for regurgitating on the airwaves pathetic excuses for indefensible behaviour.  Draw a Venn diagram and the fools spouting drivel to shield slippery Sunak and an heiress we, Akshata Murty, who’d pay £, to avoid millions of pounds in British tax, overlap with idiots who ly claimed Johnson didn’t hold parties and is innocent of all charges. Whether what non-dom Murty and Green Card Sunak did was legal misses the point that it is unacceptable for a Chancellor to put up taxes for the little people while his family lawfully dodge them. Sleaze taking the Tories back to the John Major era is a glorious opportunity for Labour – and a challenge. Leader Keir Starmer is receiving conflicting advice. Either he sticks with Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals to end the non-dom scam, or he listens to those who say it would be seen as anti-business. Championing fairness could draw a thick red line between Labour and the Tories at the election. The Conservative fish is rotting... Labour needs to use its head.

Fair enough. We are all agreed that you can’t go around slapping people, even though this column remains of the opinion that we are in a weird place with so-called comedians at awards nights: Dead set against violence but prepared to normalise the kind of bullying and humiliation of iniduals at these types of events that would probably earn you a trip to HR in the workplace. Again, shame on Rock who made Smith’s we Jada the butt of his jokes because of her shaven head. It is well known she suffers from alopecia. Would she have been fair gameshe’d had breast cancer  Reading Smith’s autobiography on holiday last week , I was also struck by this in the second chapter. “When I was nine years old, I watched my father punch my mother in the side of her head so hard that she collapsed. I saw her spit blood. That moment in that bedroom, probably more than any other in my le, has defined who I am today. “Within everything that I have done since then – the awards, the accolades, the spotlights and the attention, the characters and the laughs – there has been a subtle string of apologies to my mother for my inaction that day. “For failing her in that moment. For failing to stand up to my father. For being a coward.” None of that excuses his actions two weeks ago. But it does explain why he snapped on that night. His book also details a string of examples he would come to recognise as double standards in his negative treatment over the years. A furious debate is understood to have raged within the Academy’s , members in Whats App groups in the fortnight after Smith’s slap.It would be fascinating to see a Venn diagram of which members were dead set on Smith’s suspension and which ones signed a  petition calling for Polanski – who admitted raping a child four decades ago – to be released from detention in Zurich.It took  years for the Academy to take a stand over Polanski, only expelling him in . Before then he’d won a Best Director Oscar in  to a standing ovation. No statement from the Academy back then blasting his “unacceptable” and “harmful” conduct, as there was last week over Smith. Allegations over the conduct of a string of other big names, including Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen and Mel Gibson have not seen any of them exiled over the last few decades either, even temporarily. But consistency doesn’t appear to be paramount in the minds of the Academy or its members – only appeasing the social media mob.

The under-fire Chancellor was accused of hiding from the cameras at Darlington College on Monday, following days of criticism after it emerged billionaire we Akshata Murty had been avoiding paying UK tax as a non-dom.It also emerged that, while advisers denied access to the BBC and other broadcasters, the Chancellor was accompanied by his £,-a-year taxpayer-funded photographer.The Tory minister denied that he was out of touch with the British public, however, and insisted he understood that many ordinary families were struggling with the high cost of living.  Reporters who were allowed in were instructed in advance not to ask about the saga threatening to derail his career in an apparent bid to avoid embarrassing the under-fire minister. During questions, Mr Sunak refused to be drawn on his billionaire weaposs tax status - or claims that he held a US green card while Chancellor - and images of a smiling Chancellor, taken by his own vanity snapper, were distributed to outlets and shared on social media. A Labour source said: “Hard-working families across the country face spiralling energy bills, rising prices at the petrol pumps and crippling Tory tax rises.  “It beggars belief that Rishi Sunak is carrying on with his taxpayer-funded vanity photoshoots without a care in the world. For this out of touch Chancellor it’s a case of ‘cost of living crisis  What cost of living crisis ’” Sources at the event also said the Chancelloraposs PR advisers tried to shield the Chancellor from dficult questions when he appeared on stage with Tory mayor for Tees Valley Ben Houchen.They said: “Usually you can’t move for cameras when the mayor has ministers in town but this time the news media seemed about as welcome as a letter from HMRC on Rishi Sunak ’s doormat.They clearly wanted maximum control as the Chancellor even chaired the . During the QA, the Treasury events team with microphones didn’t even wait for the Chancellor to point out who would ask the next question asthey had been vetted in advance. Boris Johnson has ordered his sleaze advisor to look into Mr Sunakaposs financial declarations to make sure all the rules had been followed.Mr Sunakaposs political career is at risk of being derailed by the row over his weaposs non-domiciled status and his own former holding of a US green card.  Mr Sunak also asked for all three press questions to be submitted together to avoid giving detailed answers, or the opportunity for follow-ups. But asked whether he was out of touch with the British public, the Chancellor said: On cost of living, I know itaposs dficult for people. Of course I know itaposs dficult. I want to make sure that we can do, and I can do, everything we can to get through what are some challenging months ahead. People are looking at what is happening around them and seeing prices go up and of course people are worried by that. I want them to be reassured that me and the Government are on their side and doing what we can to ease the burdens that we are facing. Yet aides have briefed that Mr Sunak ordered an aggressive Whitehall inquiry into how his weaposs tax details were leaked, rather than focusing on the cost of living crisis.  Labour leader Keir Starmer said all Cabinet ministers should declare whether they have ever used schemes like non dom status to reduce their tax.I donapost have any non doms in the shadow cabinet because I understand the fairness of the issue, he said. He called for the PM to guarantee that no other members of the Cabinet have been using these schemes to reduce their tax. I think on behalf of everybody who is now paying more tax we are entitled to an answer to that question.Health Secretary Sajid Javid has admitted he was previously a non dom for tax purposes.But No  refused to say whether the PM was taking any steps to find outany other ministers, or their spouses, have green cards or non dom status. A government spokesman said: All MPs and sitting peers are automatically deemed to be resident in the UK for tax purposes, by law. Ms Murtyaposs non dom status could have saved her an estimated £ million in taxes on idends from her shares in Infosys, an Indian IT company founded by her father.

Her contracting the virus at the age of  was downplayed by Buckingham Palace. Understandably, the monarch was unable to fulfil a number of engagements and wider poor health caused her to miss ceremonies at which her attendance was once a given. Like many vulnerable and older citizens, even a head of state must look after herself and be cared for carefully because age doesn’t travel alone, as Labour MP Dennis Skinner once observed.

Nine-year-old Middlesbrough fan Theo Baverstock was intending to watch his hometown club with his dad Graeme against Fulham on Wednesday evening.However, he suffered second degree on his foot after a fellow supporter dropped a freshly poured cup of Bovril on his foot, which left him in AE, TeessideLive reports.His dad Graeme said: We went to the Boro game and we were stood in the queue and a gentleman turned around with a cup of bovril. He dropped it by accident and it went straight onto Theoaposs foot. Straight away he started screaming so itaposs gone through his shoe and his sock. First aid got involved as did the club doctor and he got taken straight to hospital where they found he had second degree burns. I felt really sorry for the gentleman who dropped it, he didnapost mean to do it and it was a total accident.Theo is quite shook up, heaposs just had it rebandaged. Heaposs had to go every two days to the hospital for checks on it. I just wanted to say that it could happen to anyone. Itaposs not against them butit is being served so hot it can so easily be dropped on anyoneaposs foot like it has done. Heaposs got a bit of an infection in it and he has to go onto antibiotics. It looks quite bad at the moment. The extent of Theoaposs burns are visible in the graphic picture which show how badly his foot was injured after the accident at the Riverside. The liquid soaked through his trainers and sock before scalding him. Although Theo is now recovering at home, he is struggling to sit and rest as heaposs a bit of a live wire. Graeme, , said: Heaposs getting there. Heaposs quite a livewire so heaposs not use to laying up. With the school holidays now he canapost go swimming or playing football - he missed his last game of the season today. It has upset him a little but in himself heaposs happy, heaposs chirpy heaposs still fine. Itaposs just harder to get him to realise how bad it could gethe doesnapost look after it and rest. It was an absolute total accident, no one is to blame for it. Graeme has praised the amazing staff at the Riverside stadium where first aiders were on the scene in minutes and police allowed him to pull his car right up to the ground so he could take Theo to hospital. He said: Iaposve got nothing but praise for the staff, the club have been great and theyaposve contacted me as well to see how he is. They didnapost have to do that. Itaposs one of those unfortunate things but I do think to myself, itaposs that hot itaposs gone through his shoe, sock and heaposs still getting second degree burns from a drink that served within a crowd. When youaposre in the queue youaposre touching shoulders, it could have landed on his chest - it could have been so much worse. Itaposs more why is it being served so hot. Iaposm not wanting to blame anyone but I donapost see how it can be so hot. Someone could knock it over anyone and itaposs going to affect them like it did Theo. I want to thank everyone with how much theyaposve helped but I wanted to get the awareness out that this can happen to people.

His mum says his massive growth is thanks to his hearty breakfasts of porridge. Alpha was born via C-section on October  last year, weighing in at a chunky lbs oz, making him Britainaposs third largest newborn.Despite not yet being six months old, big boy Alpha - who now weighs st lbs, is already wearing clothing designed for nine to -month-olds. Mum Cherral Mitchell, , told the Sun she has had to wean her hungry little man off milk.Now Alpha loves to chow down on porridge and rusk biscuits, even though most babies donapost do so until at least  weeks. Cherral said: We knew he was going to be a big boy as my bump was huge, but we didnapost realise quite how big he would be until he was here. Iaposd had three babies before and with Alpha it felt like we skipped the newborn stage altogether and went straight to him being three months old.” People often mistake Alpha and his sister Twyla-Bay for twins, despite her being more than three times his age, Cherral said, because Alpha is already almost the same height as her.Alpha starts the day with baby porridge, followed by a oz bottle of baby milk every three hours and a baby rusk biscuit in the evening. Cherral who is also mum to Rouge-Angel, five, Lyon, three, and Twyla-Bay, one, with electrical engineer husband Tyson, , said none of her other children were anywhere near Alpha’s size at the same age. When he was born at John Radclfe Hospital in  Cherral and Tyson were shocked at his size, despite doctors’ predictions that their baby would be a whopper. Cherral added: “When we first saw him, my first thought was he was not going to fit into any of the clothes I’d brought in the hospital bag. Tyson even had to go home to bring back some three to six-month clothes for him.” Hospital staff measured Alpha and began to google records for the largest babies born in the UK right there in the delivery room. They excitedly informed Cherral that her newborn was the third-largest in the UK.

The airline offered the pair an alternative flight but it would not have got them to Dubai in time for their scheduled New Years Eve celebrations. Instead David and Lotte made a mad dash over to Terminal  to catch a last-minute Emirates Air flight at their own expense. David said: The whole point of the holiday was to go for the New Year celebrations. At best after the cancelled flight with British Airways, their rescheduled one would have got us there the day after. After an enjoyable five-day getaway, David and Lotte ed home to Heathrow, in what was a less eventful leg of the journey with only a few hours delay. After months of continuously attempting to contact British Airways, however, David has still not been compensated for the majority of his trip.  The £, sum which he says he was originally owed includes the price of two business class flights from London Heathrow to Dubai, a one night stay at the Wardlow Hotel and a £ airport transfer. Of that huge sum, he has only received £, compensation, which is the industry standard for cancelled flights of that nature. David, who recently ed from a trip to Thailand, was hoping to use some of the money that is owed to him from British Airways in order to fund that. However, his holiday has been and gone, and there are still no signs of getting a full refund any time soon. He insists that he would not be content with a voucher, and has vowed never to fly with the airline again. He added: After hours on hold and countless phone calls over a period of months, the customer relations department got back to me and paid out £, compensation with is the standard aviation compensation for cancelled flights. But British Airways holidays still have not contacted me to pay back my cancelled flight, hotel and transfer costs. Despite continuously trying I still canapost get hold of them.  I recently flew with Emirates Air to Thailand and I had absolutely no problems. Even when I had a slight issue with myflight, I was able to phone someone and they actually picked up. Iaposve even had cancelled flights with Ryanair in recent years - but even with them, I was able to get a refund no problem. Their telephone systems are rigged so you can never get hold of anyone and eventually it hangs up. I have tried for hours and hours. I have sent numerous e-mails to their complains department, you eventually get a response and a case number but nothing happens, it’s a scam. As I see it British Airways have purposely set their systems up so they hold onto customersapos money - and then you can’t get hold of them to sort it out. As time goes on, I try less and less to sort it out because Iaposm in their hands. No one picks up and I just feel hopeless. I am truly at a loss. The whole system is rigged, there is nothing I can do. British Airways has been contacted for a response. It comes as British Airways CEO Sean Doyle was forced to send an apology email to tens of thousands of flyers in response to the barrage of complaints that the airline has received recently - particularly in response to people who have struggled to speak to call handlers about urgent matters.

The couple, who live in Melksham, Wiltshire, have been forced to give up their social lives as cash is so tight and have even stopped using their oven to keep bills down. Gerald served in the Royal Air Force for  years and feels the country he devoted his le to is letting him down. He tells The Mirror: “I don’t want to complain really because I‘ve had a good le, but it comes as a huge disappointment.In the quiet hours when you sit and think, well we did all that and we’ve ended up with all this worry. You’re sort of living on the edge really. “I don’t knowit’s a matter of age but you think, what did we do all that for  Le has changed completely. Before, we would go out lunching and that sort of thing, meeting friends - but we don’t do that anymore. We can’t afford it, every penny has got to be watched. For years, I’ve contributed to causes like the Salvation Army or UNICEF. I give them maybe £ or £ a month - not much - but that’s all stopped. I just can’t afford it. It grieves me to do it, but there you go, I just can’t do anything about it.” Since their bills jumped from £ to £, Gerald and Mair have started setting strict budgets for their daily gas and electricity usage, which means giving up the use of their central heating altogether. Gerald has worked out that it costs him p to boil his kettle - a cheaper solution that allows both him and Mair to surround themselves with multiple hot water bottles to stay warm while at home.They’ve also stopped using the oven to keep costs low, relying instead on their microwave. He said: “We’re on a fixed income so there’s nothing we can do about it. I can put it on and go into debt but I just want somebody to do something. “I can’t imagine a time that I can turn the heating on again, there’s nothing in sight and there’s nothing  I can do” “The dference between £ and £ - it’s a chasm that I can’t cross. I’m not putting the heating on because I refuse to go into into debt.” Gerald added: At night, we cover the bed in coats and use an extra blanket because Mair is particularly susceptible to the cold. We wear coats indoors now. They’re like long jackets lined with synthetic wool. We’re having to use those in bed too just to make sure we keep warm. As you get older, the extremes of heat and cold affect you more. “We’ve got an Aga, but we have no plans to use that. Putting it on would be absolutely catastrophic. We just use it for storage - it’s just a nice piece of furniture now, nothing .And yet this isnapost the only dficulty that the couple are facing, as the cost increase came shortly after -year-old Mair was diagnosed with vascular dementia. Gerald added:I’m trying to take it in my stride. It’s unavoidable, but just another thing to worry about really. Iaposm afraid with my weaposs illness, they sort of retreat within themselves. She doesnapost have opinions now. She has very basic feelings like aposI’m too coldapos or aposI’m too hot.aposGerald went viral on Twitter last month after sharing a message about how the price hikes are impacting their lives. He said: “Our heating is the biggest expense we’ve got. We live on very average pensions, and the reason why I put the tweet out wasnapost an appeal for help or anything, it was anger. I was so angry. When I worked the figures out I thought, my God, what am I doing  I had loads of people come back to me and say, aposweaposll give you some moneyapos. I even had a young woman say, Iaposm a single mum but Iaposve got some money put away and you’re welcome to half of it. He added: From a large point of view, there is help. I’ve also got my family.

It’d cover bills full stop, says Gerald. But Gerald believes that he shouldnapost have to rely on others to support him financially, and that the government should be held responsible for the effects that the cost of living crisis are having on regular people like himself.  I detest the thought of relying on benefits. The kindness of strangers. I really hate that. People are generous. I know that from the tweet. That really surprised me.

The pair have acknowledged that while the cost of living crisis has forced them to live frugally, they could have been much worse off.

She believes another criminal snuck into her car, a few yards away, and stole her card.According to CCTV taken inside the supermarket, a third criminal was loitering behind her, and watched her insert her PIN at the checkout. She thinks the trio worked as a team to fleece her in the shocking broad daylight theft.  Since the incident Lola, who is a widow, has struggled to sleep and has become wary of leaving her home in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire.The mother of four told Express : I have been told this activity is re, particularly in some supermarket car parks in and around London.Itaposs affected me very much. I have been struggling to sleep because I think about it all the time. It is just so clear in my mind. I have felt sad and worried, and stupid to be honest. It is just very upsetting. I have been very very upset and I no longer trust people. It was absolutely disgusting.  The money is yet to be reimbursed into Ms Sledmereaposs account although police are investigating the theft. Ms Sledmere, who worked in psychology, added: Of course, it has impacted me financially too. I am a pensioner. I have a state pension but Iaposm not well off at all. I live alone, so of course it is going to affect me financially. I have seven grandchildren who all need money and it is upsetting I canapost help them at the moment. After Ms Sledmere paid for her shopping, itaposs thought she was followed out of the supermarket and to her car by the man who saw her PIN.  She put her shopping and handbag in her vehicle, left it unlocked as she turned to push the trolley to the bay just yards away. But another man spoke to her at the bay, asking for directions to Chesham, which is less than three miles away. Ms Sledmere said: I thought this was strange. I thought he was being a bit stupid actually as there are plenty of signs for Chesham and itaposs only around the corner. But I offered help. Someone previously must have looked over my shoulder and got my PIN number when I was paying at the checkout. The checkout was the very one closest to the enclosure where people pay for their own groceries so it is pretty open and easy just for someone to stand there and not to be noticed.

Charlene Brown was with her two daughters while taking out cash from a Tesco Express in Peckham Rye to buy them all a Chinese takeaway on March .But to Charleneaposs horror, her two girls Azariah, eight, and six-year-old Kimoire were thrown to the floor while two men were tussling with each other outside the supermarket, reports MyLondon.The mum-of-two claims the attacker, a -year-old man who is non-verbal and has disabilities, hit both of the youngsters as his signicantly shorter carer struggled to restrain him. After calling  the police rushed to the shop on Rye Lane and got there very quickly, Charlene said. Speaking to MyLondon, Charlene, who lives in Brockley, said: My girls ran to me and screamed aposhe pushed meapos while crying hysterically. I went up to the men and screamed aposwhat’s going on  You’ve hurt my childrenapos. He kicked Kimoire, then I realised that Azariah was crying and her nose was bleeding. A Tesco security guard asked us to come in the store so they could attend to my eldest daughters bleeding nose. The police arrived within seconds and eventually, they explained that because the attacker is autistic and non-verbal, that meant that an arrest could not be made. Charlene, who works in a mental health inpatient ward at Lambeth Hospital, claims that both her daughters are emotionally scarred following the incident and that they are now too scared to leave the house.She added: I’m in the process of trying to arrange counselling as they’re having struggles with social spaces now. The worst part is nothing can be done. I think accountability should be taken somewhere. My children have been hurt and no one is responsible, which I think disgraceful.  Azariah and Kimoire are currently staying at their grandmotheraposs house in Bedfordshire over the Easter break - and mum Charlene is glad that they are able to enjoy some downtime in a quieter area following the unprovoked attack.Now, the NHS worker is concerned that the same thing could happen to a pregnant woman, or a baby, or another vulnerable person.Charlene says she felt disheartened that no one stopped to check that her daughters were alright, other than two local schoolboys, even though plenty of people witnessed the incident. She added: I just want to make the streets safe andpeople are hurt someone needs to take accountability. A politan Police spokesperson confirmed the incident took place. They said: Police were called at around .pm on Thursday, March , to a shop on Peckham Ryefollowing reports that a child had been pushed by a man. The girl fell to the ground and suffered minor injuries.Officers attended and detained a -year-old man who was with his carer. Due to his vulnerabilities, the man was not arrested.

And the topic of debate would be whether to toast it or simply eat it fresh, obviously with lashings of butter. But now, the supermarkets have decided that the traditional flavour was not enough. From every angle, youaposre bombarded with dferent flavours - from salted caramel to triple cheese. If youaposre a purist like me, itaposs enough to make you weep. In my opinion, the humble hot cross bun needs nothing more than plenty of fruit, a hint of spice and a glazed topping. But this isnapost enough for the modern world, so, I sampled some of the unusual offerings on sale this year. We sampled a range of hot cross buns from Waitrose, MS, Co-op, Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury’s and Tesco and gave each one a score out of five. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereMS  Extremely Cheesy Hot Cross Buns Blurb: Loaded with Extra Mature Barberaposs Farmhouse Cheddar  Smooth Red Leicester.What I thought: It’s a delicious cheese bun. But I just can’t get on board with the idea it’s a hot cross bun. It has none of the elements that turn it into one- except that it’s mockingly marked with a pastry cross. I would give this a ⅖ and only because there was cheese involved. Co-op Spiced Masala  Chilli Hot Cross BunsBlurb: Hot cross buns with caramelised onions, sultanas, ground spices and dried jalapeño chillies.What I thought: Surprisingly good. This is an elevated hot cross bun - the sweet caramelised onion pairs well with the spiced bun, while the jalapenos give a little kick. A delightful savoury treat.   Sainsburyaposs Chocolate  Caramel Hot Cross BunsBlurb: Hot cross buns made with salted caramel pieces, dark chocolate chunks and caramel fudge piecesWhat I thought: Adults should have no more than seven teaspoons of sugar per day, but this feels like that would exceed it. It is a sugary nightmare, but the caramel fudge pieces offer something dferent. Overall itaposs quite stodgy and at times, it tastes a bit synthetic.   Lidl Deluxe Triple Chocolate Hot Cross BunsBlurb: Delightfully soft, triple chocolate buns filled with indulgent milk, dark and white chocolate piecesWhat I thought: Iaposm a big fan of chocolate, so I really wanted to like these, but while they look pretty good, the first bite was dry and stale - as was the next and the next. The taste was slightly improved when the chocolate melted as it gave a little more sweetness, but it wasnapost enough to make me want to eat a whole one.  MS Salted Caramel  Blond Chocolate Hot Cross BunsBlurb: Delicately spiced hot cross buns enriched with golden blond and milk chocolate, salted caramel fudge and toffee pieces.What I thought: Hard to see how these are ‘delicately spiced’ when all you can taste is chocolate and caramel. These pack a serious sugar punch, rather than the more delicate flavours you’d normally expect from a traditional bun. If you’d like to eat a sweet pick-me-up, this is perfect, but book a visit to the dentist afterwards.   Aldi Rhubarb and Custard Hot Cross BunsBlurb : Packed full of delicious candied rhubarb with custard flavouring.What I thought : Definitely the sweetest hot cross bun I have ever tasted. The bun itself was quite light in colour and the actual taste was quite similar to that of brioche. They did not have as much fruit in them compared to a traditional hot cross bun but the candied rhubarb was a welcome sugar fix.  These are a very sweet treat and the flavours in their work really well together. Maybe they arenapost that traditional but they are certainly inventive. MS Blueberry Hot Cross Buns Blurb: Four butter enriched hot cross buns with juicy Vostizza currants and sweetened dried blueberries. Best served toasted with a spread of butter.What I thought: These were a total disappointment. Similarly to Dr Ashenden, I brand these an outrage. Itaposs basically a brioche bun with blueberries on it, and a white cross draped on top as an afterthought. The fruit is lovely and juicy, and they smell great, but I wonapost be buying another pack. ⅖The winner: Frankly, only Co-op stood a chance here, the rest were far too sweet and stodgy. I’d recommend sticking to a traditional hot cross bun.

Paige Rice, , was a passenger in an Audi S when it was involved in a fatal smash with a a Mercedes taxi in the Queensway Tunnel in October last year.Her ex-partner Callum Miller, , a labourer from Stockport, was clocking speeds of mph as he drove the Audi through the tunnel - which connects Liverpool and Birkenhead.An inquest into their deaths, held at Gerard Majella Courthouse in Kirkdale on January , heard Merseyside Police initially launched a criminal investigation into a potential offence of causing death by dangerous driving.But the probe was dropped when it became clear Callum would not survive.Dashcam footage of the crash, which also left the taxi driver with le-changing injuries to his leg and hip, has now emerged on social media, the Liverpool Echo reports. Clare Rice, Paigeaposs mum said she has not been able sleep since finding out that the video was circulating online as she asked people to remove any posts containing the footage. Ms Rice wrote: Yesterday, I found out there’s a video circulating on social media, a video of the crash that killed my daughter. Now I have no idea who has this video and how it’s got online but I want you to know, I’ve not slept since and I feel sick to the stomach. After we lost Paige I was askedI wanted to view the footage, I chose not to for my own sanity. When you grieve someone who’s died and in such a tragic way, Your mind chooses what to think about and what to block out.Finding out the video was online has been really triggering for me, moments which I’d been blocking out to survive my days were now at the forefront of my mind. Why would you want to watch my daughteraposs last moments  I’m heartbroken, the thought of strangers, people who don’t know Paige or me watching something so traumatic and distressing. When people post such personal pictures or videos without consent, it can have a serious impact on people’s lives. Ms Rice said her le has been turned upside down by the death of her daughter as she shared a series of photos of herself with Paige growing up. She continued: I’m still Paige’s mum and I still have that protective instinct. I know Paige would hate that this video is online. Look at these pictures, this is my beautul baby girl Paige.  She was taken from us in October, only  years old. No matter how old your child gets, they’re still our babies. I had Paige at a young age and it’s Pretty much always been us three. My le has revolved around my children and making sure they never went without. I can’t tell you how much my le has been turned upside down since loosing my daughter. When you lose a child, just getting through an hour is an accomplishment.  The last five months has been a blur when it comes to time and I don’t know how I’m surviving each day with this heartache, a pain you will never know, unless you’ve lived it. To cause added stress and upset is disrespectful and thoughtless. My le will never be the same again. I’ve lost my daughter and my friend and my son has lost his sister and we’ve all lost a massive piece of our lives. Paige left behind many broken hearts, she is loved and now missed by so many people, someone’s daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin and friend. We don’t deserve any more upset. I hope the posts are removed, I’d be extremely thankful.

Sabina Nessa, , was murdered by Koci Selamaj in a park in South East London last September. He has been jailed for le after pleading guilty to the horric crime and had refused to attend sentencing proceedings in court last week, with Mr Justice Sweeney calling this decision cowardly - a video link was made available to him, but he turned it down. Sister Jebina Yasmin Islam told BBC Radio aposs Today programme this morning she didnapost feel her sisteraposs murder received enough press coverage. She said: My sister didn’t get as much headlines, I feel, at the start. Maybe was it down to her ethnicity  “She didn’t get the front pages on some of the papers and, in Sarah Everard’s case, she did. I think it’s just down to our ethnicity, to be honest. And I feel likewe were a normal British white family we would have been treated equally, I guess.” She also said that there has been no support from the Government, describing people in senior positions as useless. She added: Theyaposve not said nothing.  Priti Patel has done a tweet on Friday and I was not happy about it because all of a sudden sheaposs using my sisteraposs name for publicity reasons. And to be honest she has no right.Afterwards, Jebina appeared on ITV to speak about her sister.Speaking about the huge loss, Jebina explained: Itaposs all surreal, it feels like a bad dream that weaposre all going through. Itaposs just heartbreaking, you would never have thought that your young -year-old sister was brutally taken away.  If she was like ill, we could have had some time to spend time with her, make memories. But her le was taken away without a second thought and out of nowhere. Itaposs impacted us a lot, itaposs impacted myself, my sisters, weaposre scared to walk the streets alone now, and also given the time of day as well. It was also revealed that Sabina had plans to one day become a headteacher. On Frida, Selamaj was jailed for le and must serve a minimum of  years. Sabina was strangled after being struck on the head  times with a hazard triangle. Following Koci’s sentencing, Sabina’s sister Jebina Islam hit out at Home Secretary Priti Patel for her “lack of support”.She responded to a tweet from Ms Patel, who insisted she was doing “everything in her power” to tackle violence against women and girls.Jebina wrote: Yes @pritipatel you don’t know what we as a family are going through and to be honest you haven’t even bothered to ask since the death of my sister. Lack of support from yourself and @BorisJohnson just shows how ‘important’ it is to tackle male violence to you guys.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Murder\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The NHS Confederation has accused the Government of abandoning any interest in Covid whatsoever and says hospitals are set to deal with a brutal Easter as bad as any winterapos.Last week Covid cases hit the highest since February  at , infections. That is despite official tallies having plunged because of Noaposs decision to axe the £billion-a-month mass-swabbing regime. The NHS Confederation, which acts as a representative for hospitals and ambulance trusts, called for mitigating actions such as not meeting people indoors and mask-wearing in crowded spaces. This would help prevent the spread of the virus, the health and wellbeing organisation told The Times.It also said the Government needs to introduce a public information campaign in England to ask people to stay away from AE unless they have an emergency.The so-called coronavirus dashboard shows casesdecreasing, however hospitalisations and deaths are still rising although both statistics usually lag behind infections.It is estimated a record one in  people currently have coronavirus in England.  Confederation boss Matthew Taylor said: NHS leaders report a clear disconnect between the Governmentaposs Living with Covid plan and the realities at the NHS front line. We have a Government that seems to want to wash its hands of responsibility for what is occurring in plain sight up and down the country. No  has seemingly abandoned any interest in Covid whatsoever.It comes after Boris Johnson said he canapost rule out another Covid lockdown after previously promising the route to normality was irreversible following two years of draconian restrictions. Mr Johnsonaposs plan has been for us to learn to live with Covid, and the lack of panic from rising cases appears to be due to reports that the latest strain doesnapost cause any more severe illness. Free Covid tests have now ended for the majority of people in England. Only the vulnerable, including those with health conditions and high-risk jobs, will be eligible to pick up swabs without paying. Health bosses still say that vaccines are the best line of defence and spring booster jabs are being rolled out for certain groups.

However, the North West will also experience some lingering cloud, making eastern areas the best destination for sunseekers over the Easter weekend.  Met Office meteorologist Annie Shuttleworth said: If people are travelling for sunshine, then further eastern areas are more likely to see that brighter weather.I think in the main for the bank holiday weekend, weaposll see temperatures quite widely above average across the UK and hopefully they could be very warm in the South East in particular. Warmer than average certainly, but nowhere near heatwave criteria.

Growing up in Italy, Claudia Serra knew something was dferent about her voice. She realised that she couldnapost scream in the playground like other children and singing in school plays was hard as well.Even just talking in a noisy environment or with a group was exhausting,My London reports. When Claudia was , she decided to see a doctor, and was diagnosed with left vocal cord paralysis, a rare condition which causes the voice to sound breathy, quiet and weak, and can affect the breathing.If both cords are affected, the voice can disappear altogether.In Claudiaaposs case, the condition was caused at birth as she was been born prematurely at just six months old. The -year-old said: Despite the pathology, it was a relief to know what was happening. It was the answer I had been waiting for for a long time, especially in adolescence...I was ready to do what I could to find my voice. Once she had finished school, Claudia started speech therapy, which aimed to move the working cord towards the paralysed one. After nine months of twice-weekly sessions and daily breathing and vocal exercises, she found out that, despite some nodules on her vocal cords being removed, her voice still sounded the same.In , Claudia opted for a surgical intervention, known as an Injection Laryngoplasty. The surgery works by injecting fat into the vocal cords to increase their volume - and means that Claudia lost her voice entirely for a week, communicating with a pen and paper. When it re-emerged, it had increased in strength - but only temporarily. The following year, Claudia says she re-attempted the same surgery, only to find that the results were similar: a brief period of improvement, before her voice ed to its previous state. For the next six years, Claudia tried dferent forms of speech therapy, to little success.  Eventually, she says her doctors in Italy told her that there was nothing more that they could do for her. She said: This brought me a lot of sadness...I have never been able to enjoy a nice evening in the pub, or go out for dinner with a group because it is dficult to be heard in noisy environments. Otherwise at the end of the day, vocal fatigue assaults you and you no longer want to talk to anyone. A vocal problem affects everyday le. Itaposs not just about having a hoarse or lower tone - the voice is a delicate communication tool. [We use it to]communicate, to work, have social relationships and to express our feelings. The voice is the mirror of the soul.In October , having moved to London two years earlier, Claudia had her third surgery: a thyroplasty, where an implant was inserted through the cartilage into her voice box. She was optimistic, and at first pleased with the results. She said: After surgery in November my voice was much louder, as was my laughter and coughing. I had less respiratory fatigue while walking, for example, and in noisier environments it seemed easier to raise my voice and speak. But in December, Claudia felt disappointed again, as her voice began to strain in loud environments. [Itaposs like] I miss the air, asI were climbing a mountain. I have to rest, plus [I have] neck and throat pain. At the time, Claudia says she was working at a dog grooming salon. With the sound of dogs barking, pets being washed and people talking, Claudia says it became dficult for her to communicate - leading to fatigue and severe neck pain - and she left the job. It was a real blow that Claudiaaposs third surgery hadnapost altered her voice. She said: I was hoping that with the last intervention I would finally be able to get my voice, to get more vocal stability, but it didnapost happen. Of course, there are those very dficult and despondent moments, but then I look inside myself and I see that there is still that strength and courage to go on and keep fighting.

In terms of her work, she is having a hard time finding a job which will accommodate her needs. She enjoyed her role at the grooming salon, and loves cooking, flowers and photography, but requires a quiet working environment where she does not have to strain or raise her voice. All this has made me a very empathetic, sensitive person who knows how to listen, said Claudia. I would also like to expand my knowledge on the voice - and maybe one day help someone like me.  And, despite her long struggle to be heard, Claudia is finally speaking out: she runs a YouTube channel and Instagram account where she shares her experiences, and intends to write a book about her vocal journey.She said: Despite the ups and downs, these years in search of my voice have given me the strength not to give up. There are many people with dferent vocal problems, who do not feel understood, who feel alone, who do not know how to treat their pathology, or who give up. I want them to know that they are not alone and that they donapost have to give up...I know how hard it can be, but one day you will find your voice!

Sculptor Bob Cassilly had the idea for Cementland, which was a -acre attraction that was once a thriving factory outside of St. Louis, Missouri but when the factory closed down, the area became a dumping ground for construction companies.The theme park was herald as one of the strangest theme parks in America for its niche theme and troubles over the years, the Daily Star reports.The original cement buildings had been neglected and decaying- but Cassilly had a vision to spruce up the landscape to a wide range of dferent ideas.  Mr Cassilly had a vision which ran more than just cement and ruins as he saw an idea for art and history, architecture, and evolution. Bob said back in : “They talk about historic districts and stuff like that but one of the main things is, our architecture is basically copying stuff from Europe. But our industry, it’s kind of like jazz, it’s an American, original thing.  Why not look at it for what it is  It’s impressive. It might be threatening, but you can’t help but be impressed by it.” The attraction has been photographed by Paul Sableman, where you can see glimpses of Mr Cassillyaposs vision for the amusement park were slowly taking place. His dream was to create an art amusements park but it never got off the ground after a horrying incident where Cassilly was tragically run down by a bulldozer and killed on the building site of Cementland on September , . He was  years old.  However, his widow and several medical experts didn’t believe that Bob’s cause of death was a bulldozer accident. In , physician Dr Arthur Combs reexamined the autopsy reports and said he believes the sculptor was beaten to death before the murder scene was staged to look like an accident.Over the last six years, the ruins have fallen into further disrepair after a warehouse fire caused a roof to fall in. There was an attempt to put security in who were hired to keep vandals and trespassers away in  but in  there is no evidence that this arrangement remains in place, according to the latest photographs. And over the last last six years, the land has been neglected after a warehouse fire caused a roof to fall in. In order to honour Cassilly’s le, memorials have been held at Cementland but the attraction remains incomplete.

Chlamydia, she revealed. Apparently, the mum-to-be has been obsessed with the name ever since reading The Odyssey in school and always liked her Greek Mythology stories. Realising that her friend was referring to the character Clytemnestra, she corrected her, but this only annoyed the mum.

Right apos And sheaposs all, aposNo, I meant Chlamydia.aposAfter a quick Google search proved that she was right, the friend backed down - but she was noticeably annoyed for the rest of the night.When the Reddit poster went home that night, she received a long text from the mum, calling her a bad friend for embarrassing her in front of everyone. She says I could have brought it up in private and didnapost need to be so condescending about it.She was just talking about a name she liked and I made her feel like an idiot. The woman said she ignored the text, as she thought her friend was being an idiot, for basing her childaposs name on a book she hadnapost read in years and mixing it up with an STI. A simple google search before getting so attached to the name would have solved the problem before there was one, she said. But then she started getting texts from the other girls in the group telling her how upset the mum was and how she should apologise.I donapost think I have anything to apologise for, and besides, they were perfectly happy to sit there and let her think her std baby name would be a good choice, she continued. Imagine how embarrassed she would have been after she found the mistake later and realised that none of her friends had the decency to tell her the truth. She concluded her post by asking Reddit users whether she was in the wrong but the majority said she did the right thing. One person said: You didn’t embarrass her - every single person within earshot already clocked her mistake - you were the only person decent enough to correct her. Another wrote: If sheaposs old enough to be pregnant, she should be old enough to know what chlamydia is. She embarrassed herself.

John West, , has toured the country to compile a catalogue of chilling experiences for his new book, Britainaposs Haunted Heritage.In the tome he writes of mountain beasts, a fleet of phantom Viking longships and the spirit armies from each side of the English Civil War battling even after death. The folklore expert has compiled two books on ghosts after visiting Edinburgh and its spooky surrounds. He said Scotland is particularly re with the supernatural and spectres, calling it the most-haunted part of the UK, due to its history of war and plagues. John told The Sun : “Scotland is a country steeped in history. It’s endured invasion, war and plagues.It’s no wonder it must be the most-haunted part of the UK. I believe Celts are much more in tune with the paranormal. But even now, there are places which make my blood run cold. “The atmosphere becomes oppressive in these places and you just need to get out of there. Scotland has them in abundance.” The folklore expert revealed one particularly blood-curdling sighting is of a ft grey man which is said to haunt the hills of Ben Macdui in the Cairngorms. Reports about the humanoid monster go back  years, with climbers saying they were terrorised by the monster. Another story involves the ghost of a wizard stalking the grounds of a medieval building in Edinburgh.  John also wrote of the chilling case of Major Thomas Weir and his sister Jane- who were both accused of witchcraft before being executed in . But a part of their home is still standing in the city - and visitors claim to hear laughter and chanting ringing out from its rooms. John, who says heaposs been interested in haunted sights since he was a boy, has been ghost hunting for  years. He said he became fascinated by the paranormal realm after sneaking away to read his mumaposs books of ghost stories. John would be transfixed by the phantoms on the covers, he added. The ghost hunter, who lives in London, says that rural communities and Scottish islands are just as haunted as the big cities like Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.  He says Iona - which is situated in the Outer Hebrides - is haunted by a fleet of ghostly Viking longships. Meanwhile, spectral armies have clashed at the Pass of Killiekrankie in Perthshire, John says. Earlier today, it emerged that a hotel dubbed the UKaposs most haunted terried the workmen tasked with its demolition after thinking they were trapped in rooms by unseen spirits. The former Birkdale Palace Hotel was once the talk of the town in Southport, attracting the likes of A-listers such as Frank Sinatra and Peter Sellers.

But due to him living overseas and restrictions in place because of the coronavirus pandemic, she has only met him a couple of times.This past weekend, her family was having a big reunion. My fiancé complained about the reunion and told me he could not attend, she said, despite her saying how much it would mean to herhe met more of her relatives. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. However, when the day rolled around, he told her that he would meet her there. While we were chatting with family members, my aunt asked him what he did for a living and he answered, and everything seemed to go well, she said. When I got home, I saw my fiancé sitting on the couch playing a video game. I askedhe had a good time at the reunion and he told me he did. But, having felt like something was off, she asked him to tell her what her cousinaposs name was - and he couldnapost answer. He thought about it for a long minute and then started laughing, she said.He told me that his twin brother attended the reunion and he was dropped off by a friend. I was so angry with him that I asked him to leave so I could think everything through. He went to stay with a friend and Iaposm still so devastated that he would pull this kind of prank on me. My parents are very upset with him and are being very supportive. He thinks Iaposm being dramatic and there was no harm in what he did. She concluded her post by asking users whether it was unreasonable of her to be angry with him, but people were quick to assure her he was in the wrong. One person said: This is gold! I have siblings that are twins. They pulled the olapos switcheroo in grade school. But by age  you should know better.Another wrote: That wasnapost a aposprankapos but a horrible stunt attempt for him to avoid a family reunion. I would evaluate this relationship and askpulling that aposprankapos was really worth upsetting his future in-laws. Not to mention how the extended family will feelthey find out about this stunt. A third commented: Itaposs honestly really weird, though. Itaposs like they watched way too many kidaposs shows where twins swap places and thought it would still be hilarious even though theyaposre grown men. Someone  wrote: Homie dropped these, along with a number of red flag emojis. And one person said: Really better rethink marrying this guy. What do you think  Was he wrong to prank her or is she overreacting  Let us know in the comments.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked. Always climb gates at the hinge end.On reaching large farm sheds take the small bridge over Killean burn and cut through the field to the shore.Your route once more wends its way down the beach, over an igneous dyke and Permian red sandstone, all the way back to A’Chleit. Allow an hour for this section when checking tides.If you finish early enough there may even be time to pop down to Glenbarr stores for a well-deserved cuppa."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 28 2021 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTaken just across Loch Fyne from Tarbert, this week#s featured photo was submitted by a reader from Cowal # too modest to be named, sadly # from the site of the controversial #ark# on the hills above Tighnabruaich.The sculpture of Noah#s Ark was built # without planning consent, though later permitted # to provoke thought about the climate crisis by local environmentalist and woodworker David Blair.The sculpture has been featured many times in this and other publications, but the site on which it sits is stunning, and the photographer was standing close to the ark for the photograph.To the left is the Isle of Bute, with Tighnabruaich and Kames on the opposite side of the Kyles of Bute.

As the country emerged from its second lockdown, football was one of the few after-school activities available. As a result, many more girls came along to try the sport for the first time with the existing mixed teams at the club.Sensing the enthusiasm, Ally Robb, LVSC chairman and one of the club’s coaches, saw the potential to develop an all-girls team for the first time. With the support of fellow coach Bob Campbell, he ran an initial training session for P-P girls. This was quickly followed by another mini milestone: a first ever LVSC U girls’ game in a friendly against Penicuik in June .“After a great first game, coaches and parents alike were keen to ensure this new chapter in the club’s history was given every opportunity to succeed,” said Ally.In the nine months since the inaugural game, the club has extended training to include girls from P to P. Three new coaches subsequently joined the team and, with the support of parent helpers, they organise weekly training sessions and games.The club and team are now affiliated with the Scottish Women’s Football Association and this year have attended tournaments in Lauder, Galashiels and Coldstream, playing a mix of three, four and seven-a-side games..removeAnd it’s fair to say that the girls are loving the experience.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve. He forgives you and remembers your sins no more."},{"url":null,"title":"west road overnight surfacing works rescheduled","story":"Due to operational reasons, the project will now begin on Sunday, April , for  nights.No works will take place on Fridays or Saturdays.

sunshine was breaking through the last remaining wisps of morning mist. Signs of spring, my favourite season, were visible all over our garden. The blackbird was perched on the fence and I opened the window so I could hear his song better.I watched him for a moment. He is a regular visitor but he seemed particularly vocal this morning. Then I noticed there was a female blackbird as well. I felt privileged that I could witness their visit to our small rewilded garden, which we have tried to make bird friendly.Then the singing stopped and they both seemed to be peering down at the patch of soil where we have recently planted wildflower seeds and vegetables. The male landed on the soil and began hopping in a zig-zag fashion, stopping every now and then. At first I wonderedthis was a dance to impress the female, but soon realised he was looking for breakfast.Blackbirds love earthworms and I supposed the overnight rain on the exposed soil of our newly seeded flowerbed meant it was a good moment to go hunting for his favourite food. He was looking for worms, but also listening for them, as blackbirds can hear the sound of them moving underground. I find that almost dficult to believe, but apparently it’s true. It was fascinating and joyous to watch.But I don’t knowhe caught any worms. My attention was taken by the sound of our kids getting up. School day morning routine beckoned. Time seems to vanish in the drama of it all, and so after I kissed my we goodbye as she headed for work, I quickly got busy making the kids’ breakfast.It was at this moment an emotion overtook me: guilt. I often feel a sense of guilt when I know others are suffering terribly. One solution could be to disconnect from it, not think about it, or even try not to care. After all, we have our own family worries and problems to sort out.But the guilt comes from the empathy I feel and I don’t want to disconnect from that. I don’t think I could stop caring evenI tried. The world needs more empathy, not less. But there is a downside to it: it can become overwhelming and even affect my mental health.Guilt in this context is such a useless emotion. It doesn’t help those who are suffering and it certainly doesn’t help the person feeling empathy. So as my guilt arrived at the breakfast table that morning, I gave it short shrt and became determined to replace it with two things.The first was to learn the lesson the blackbird had taught me moments before, to enjoy the moment and the gts around me. It put me in mind of a beautul short film of the artist David Hockney, made by Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. It’s titled The World is Beautul and he talks about the beauty around us and that when bad news is dominating our senses, the arrival of spring is good news. The important thing is to really notice the gts around us, which Hockney says he does with “intensity”.So I took up his advice and, on my walk to school with my son, I made sure I was fully present for him as he talked about monsters, Dr Who and his favourite scenes from Clash of the Titans. I savoured every moment of our connection and conversations.On myto the house, I made an extra effort to notice the beauty of spring’s arrival and other gts: the diamond-like sparkle of the dew drops on the grass, and the patterns made by the children running and playing amongst them, the dedication of George the lollipop man in keeping us all safe, the brief and faint rainbow in the sky above us, and the shimmer of the sea below the trees in bloom, and the yellow carpet of daffodils dancing in the breeze the birdsong, the smiles and greeting of people, the sense of community, the warmth of the sun the fact of being alive and having loved ones in my le.The walk was only four minutes, but when we notice the beauty and gts we have around us with the intensity that Hockney mentions, then we don’t measure with time.The second thing was to change my guilt into acts of compassion that can make a dference, no matter how small. Donate, write a letter, send a message of support, whatever. That way, empathy works for positive change for those in need.I already knew all this, but it seems I constantly need to relearn it. And that morning, the blackbird helped me to do so. His song was an awakening gt, his zig-zag hop across the soil a reminder that we should have moments when we pause to look and listen with “intensity.”Asto confirm this, he was still there on the fence when I ed home.

Unfortunately, I still have a job to do and won’t be holidaying for a few months, but it doesn’t stop me dreaming of sun and sea. I do love the south of France and hopefully I’ll be heading there soon.But what about my pets  When I’m away for a short spell, I like someone to look after my pets in their own home. They are relaxed in their own environment.However, when on a longer holiday, my pets are looked after extremely well by boarding kennels and cattery in East Lothian. Cats are not usually the best travellers but you can try using calming cat pheromones to relax them. Your vet can advise you on ‘Feliway’ cat calming products for any journey. My dog Lucy, on the other hand, loves travelling and adores going to the boarding kennel. She gets so excited when she knows she is on her way to the kennels.But whatyou want to take your pets with you on holiday  In Britain today, pets can travel by road, rail, sea or air. Each form of travel presents its own unique set of problems.The Highway Code is very specic about animals in cars. They should be under control in vehicles and unable to distract you while you are driving. If you want your dog to be loose in the car, he should be separated from you, and thus an estate vehicle, SUV or hatchback with a strong dog guard is ideal. Alternatively, a crate or cage can be used, the dimensions of which should be comfortable for the animal.Travel, or more correctly motion sickness, affects many dogs. It is due to the effect of the motion on the organs of balance located in the inner ear. Signs are usually excessive salivation, restlessness or excitement. Consult your veterinary surgeon as there are several prescription medicines that are extremely effective for this condition. Excitable dogs can be tranquilised but make sure you do not give too much, which may result in your pet becoming very drowsy, since the dose depends largely on the temperament and amount of excitement.Remember that even the most well-behaved dog can take fright at the sight and noise associated with a railway station and trains. Make sure that the collar and lead are strong and secure.Today, dferent railway companies have ying conditions regarding the transport of pets and therefore you should always enquire prior to your trip. Cats should be transported in secure carriers at all times. When travelling on the underground with your dog, remember it must be carried up and down any escalators. If you have a large dog, seek other means of access to the .Many ships and ferries today have permanent kennels into which your dog must be placed for the duration of the trip. The provision of a familiar blanket or toy helps to ease the tension of the journey for your pet.International Air Transport Associationregulations regarding carrier size apply to all international flights. Remember the container will be your pet’s home for theof the flight and also for an appreciable time prior to and after the flight after you have checked in and until he is collected after the flight. The carrier should be large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around freely. It is useful to use several thicknesses of newspaper, plus an acrylic dog bed of the VetBed type as bedding. A familiar article in the container helps to calm the animal. It is always worthwhile checking with the airline regarding their particular requirements.Not only has Covid- had a marked effect on travel, Brexit certainly has in respect of travelling overseas with your pets. Previously, for travel to EU countries, we vets could issue passports for your pet to travel with you to Europe. This is no longer the case.If you are considering travelling to an EU country with your pet, please start to plan long before your trip. Animals, specically dogs, cats and ferrets, require an Animal Health Certicateto travel to an EU country, including Northern Ireland. Any other pets require an Export Health Certicate or,you are travelling to non-EU countries, you will require a specic certicate issued in combination of DEFRA and the country you are travelling to.If you are travelling to an EU country, your pet needs to be microchipped and registered to you in the UK. This has to be read and confirmed by a vet prior to your pet being vaccinated against rabies.Recently, Mr Andrew Finlayson came to our Tranent surgery with his beautul greyhounds Celt and Lassie for their rabies vaccines. I checked their microchips and their paperwork prior to giving their vaccines. The AHC can only be issued more than three weeks after this rabies vaccination. The vet must be a registered official veterinary surgeonin order to be able to complete the certicate. The certicate cannot be issued until within  days of your travel from the UK date. Your vet needs to check your pet at this time.If you are travelling to Northern Ireland, Eire, Malta, Norway or Finland, your pet needs to be given medication against tapeworms between one and five days of you travelling. At Dunedin Vets, we combine this with the examination for the AHC.Each AHC is unique to your pet or pets. Up to five animals can travel on one certicate. The certicates are only valid for one journey from the UK. You have to state the country where you are entering the EU and there only certain designated ports or airports you can travel to. There is a specic AHC for each EU country and each one issued has its own unique certicate number, for your pet or pets. The AHC is valid for up to four months you mustto the UK before this time is up, but you can travel around EU countries during this time.These AHCs are long documents which have to be completed accurately with all the correct details, which owners have to provide in advance to the veterinary surgeon who completes them.If you are considering taking your pets to the EU this summer, contact your veterinary surgeon as soon as possible to ensure all the required paperwork is in order. We want to avoid disappointments at all costs.If you are wanting to travel further afield, contact DEFRA as soon as you know. A recent Export Health Certicate for dogs travelling to Dubai took almost six months to arrange.Plan in advance and hopefully everyone can have a lovely summer holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-park-new-home-french-sport-petanque","story":"Visitors to Lauderdale Park will be able to try their hand at the sport of petanque.The sport, which involves trying to score points by having boules closer to the target than the opponent, dates back more than  years.Now, after work between ious groups, a petanque piste has been created in the town, similar to that found in Haddington and North Berwick.Stuart McCombie, who has represented Scotland in petanque, is behind the idea to bring the sport to Dunbar.He said: “I used to play petanque many years ago at ious levels with ying degrees of success.“I retired to Dunbar three years ago and there are no petanque facilities within Dunbar.“For the last of couple of years, I have been playing in Haddington.“They have got a beautul piste set up beside the river and the church.“I play there with the UAand it was not until I moved here and joined that I was playing regularly again on a Wednesday.“They also play on a Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday and it is a long-established nice group of folk.“I looked round and North Berwick have got a small piste by the tennis courts but there’s nothing in Dunbar.”Dunbar already has its own French connection, having been twinned with the town of Lignieres for nearly  years.Discussions took place between Mr McCombie, Dunbar and District Twinning Association, Dunbar Community Council and Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership . An appeal was put out on social media to check levels of interest in the facility being created.Mr McCombie told the Courier he was “quite taken aback” by the feedback and decided to move forward with the plans.Funding was sourced from both the community council and DELAP, with work to create the piste in Lauderdale Park well under way.Mr McCombie said: “The building is near completion.“The piste is now almost up and running and I’ve had the first throw, just testing the surface.“It is a fantastic setting, a beautul setting. I did not think for a moment we would get inside the walled garden of Lauderdale Park.”Members of the public will be able to play the sport whenever there is not an organised event being held.Anyone without their own boules can hire them for £ – which covers everyone involved in the game – from the park’s cafe.Disabled access has also been created at the piste, with an official launch expected to coincide with Dunbar Civic Week, which runs from June  to  this year.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, was delighted to see the plans moving forward.She said: “Several dferent options were considered and the conclusion was Lauderdale Park was the best.“It is protected, it has a wall, a cafe, when children are playing in the garden the parents can play petanque.“The other big thing is that it is entirely accessible to anybody. Little kids can play, adults can play, disabled people can play and I just thought it was fun.”"},{"url":null,"title":"outlander-heading-east-lothian","story":"John Muir Country Park, near Dunbar, was converted into an -century battle camp on Sunday, with residents spotting rows of identical old-fashioned tents.Other period pieces were also spotted, including horse-drawn carts, cannons, old-fashioned woven bags for sand or grain and other smaller props.The area remains cordoned off to the public, with cast and crew not having arrived on the site as of yet.The period drama has become an international sensation, following the history of Scotland from the Highland clearances to the Jacobite rebellion and beyond.Actor Sam Heughan has been spotted filming already in Fe and Edinburgh, leading many to believe he will soon be visiting East Lothian as well.More details about what historical battle will be filmed in the county remain unknown, but locals will be hoping to get a glimpse of their favourite actors as they eagerly await the next instalment of the series."},{"url":null,"title":"met-office-easter-bank-holiday-scotland-weather-forecast","story":"It’s not all bad news though, the weather is set to clear up towards the weekend and it should certainly start to feel a little warmer than it has of late.While it might not be time to pack away your umbrella just yet, spring-like weather is on the way.If you havent already heard, its warming up in the run up to #Easter, but just how high will #temperatures climb  📈Find out in our updated weather for the week ahead 👇 pic EfHeVdpPIt is a rather wet and chilly start to the week rain is expected across most of Scotland today and tomorrow.

Like … this big.” I pulled a rolling pin out of the cutlery drawer.“Lucky! And was he generous ”This confirms all men’s worst nightmares of how women describe these occasions.The full account of the previous evening’s exertions are outrageously funny and gloriously manky.In all the spilling and leaking and splashing, though, there’s humanity and compassion as one girl struggles through shame and self-doubt to find what everyone is looking for: love and a little tenderness.“I was really touched by the messages I was getting from other women when I first started posting my blogs. They were telling me that they’d been waiting for years for someone to describe how it really is for them in real le.“There was a time when people tended to be judgmental about dating websites, as though it was for desperadoes. But it’s totally mainstream now.”I ask herit’s not fraught with a greater degree of peril for women than it is for men. Are they taking a bigger risk Several of my female friends have relayed tales of meeting blokes who think that the simple act of agreeing to go on a date is a contractual guarantee of sex.“I’ve never agreed to date someone with whom I haven’t had a prolonged period of chatting beforehand. Therefore, you can usually tell who the roasters are. Are they over-affectionate or too complimentary about the way you look “Andyou’re only agreeing to have a coffee then that sets its own boundaries.“When I was younger I was probably quite naive about all of this, but you learn from experience. I think you can get a sense of someone from the way they dress and their chatthey’re bad news.“My friends call this ‘The f***-boy vibes’.”This is one of several revelatory locutions with which Sophie acquaints me during our conversation. I strive to appear knowledgeable and seasoned about all of this and affect an insouciant man-of-the-world vibe that soon crumbles.I’m treated to some other new concepts. One of these is “dropping a pin”.Sophie explains this is a safety mechanism where her friends can electronically embed her location on their smartphones in case anything untoward unfolds.Another one is the “Tinder-walk”. This, Sophie explains, became one of the big features of Scotland in lockdown while people like me were watching old football videos and trying to decipher cookery books.Yet this Tinder-walk malarkey possesses a reassuringly vintage aesthetic. “Everyone got a dog and went on Tinder walks during lockdown,” she says. “It helped to ease us all through the social restrictions and was a way of keeping the flames of romance enkindled.”Heather Suttie, the Scottish events and PR specialist, was thrilled when she first read A Glasgow Kiss. “It just seemed to be what a lot of us had been waiting for,” she said. “I can’t remember laughing so much at a book – and crying too.“It’s just so honest and it could only have been written by a Glaswegian because it’s got that honesty and directness that’s usually missing from fiction that deals with sex and relationships.”Suttie is founder of BookFace, an international, online book club that holds monthly events in Glasgow with modern authors. “When Sophie appeared at one last month the response from women and men was overwhelmingly positive. Yes, some of the scenes are outrageously graphic, but they’re leavened with humour and honesty.”There are several astonishing aspects to A Glasgow Kiss. It’s been written by a first-time author who had not the remotest idea of how to break into the publishing world and yet has secured her a two-book deal featuring the further adventures of Zara.And as well as hitting top spot in the Erotic Fiction charts, Waterstone’s made it one of their books of the year. Yet, she’s still looking for a literary agent.Perhaps the most startling is that Sophie wrote the book while juggling the demands of being a full-time nurse in a busy Glasgow hospital during lockdown with the responsibilities of being a single mother to two children.“I didn’t really stop to think about that,” she said. “Writing the book probably helped me cope during the pandemic.”And while the majority of the responses to the book have been from women, quite a few blokes responded too.“I can honestly say that all the responses from men, including from some former internet dates, have been very positive. They all got the humour.“One messaged me last night and said: ‘F*** me, it was like reading an old scuddy mag when I was a lad. If you ever feel like ditching the halo just give me a shout and I’ll take you out’. I mean, where did he even get his hands on the book ”Any worries she may have harboured about the reactions of friends and family were ill founded.“I’d only initially told a few of them and they were all so supportive. I was a bit more anxious about my family’s reaction, to be honest.“They’re all pretty committed and traditional west of Scotland Catholics, but my mum says she’s very proud of me. She hasn’t read it and I don’t really want her to. But she knows what it’s about. And my family have also said that, of all of them, I was the one with no filters.“I recently bumped into one of my gran’s friends, a woman in her s. She waved over and said: ‘I bought your book. I sat down with it at  o’clock last week and I didn’t stop til am.’ And she’s the holiest wee woman ever. She’s lovely.“And then she said: ‘Your granny would have been so proud of you’. “I was also a bit worried about how it might be received at my workplace. And then I saw that some of my patients were reading it. One of them was sitting in our dialysis unit reading it and asked me to come over and sign it for her.”Recently, on the gogglebox, there have been some howlers posing as provocative television drama that are about as edgy as Classic FM.You find yourself unconsciously casting A Glasgow Kiss even as you’re reading it, as it’s perfect for a six-part comedy drama. The second book in the series will be published in August and by then Sophie hopes to have found an agent.There’s a message from the author at the front of the book. It says simply: “This book is for any girl who has ever wondered why she isn’t enough.“Just open your eyes and raise your standards. I see you.”l A Glasgow Kiss, by Sophie Gravia, is published in paperback by Orion Books, £..It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

The channel’s salad days are in the past. Being owned by the Gov is restrictive. Time for C to fly the nest towards a very exciting future.”Ms Dorries also apologised to Allsopp after spelling her name incorrectly.She said: “Apologies, I know your name is spelt Kirstie, @KirstieMAllsopp. My autocorrect disagreed, I should have double checked!”Plans for the sale will reportedly be set out in a White Paper later this month and will be included in a new Media Bill for next spring.A string of Tory MPs and peers, including Sir Peter Bottomley, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sportcommittee Julian Knight, and former cabinet ministers Damian Green and Jeremy Hunt have publicly questioned the plans.Sir Peter, who represents Worthing West, said he opposes the sale “because I am a Conservative”.On Monday, Lucy Powell, Labour’s shadow culture secretary, dismissed the suggestion the sale of Channel  would help the regions.She tweeted: “Selling off C to a foreign media giant is the opposite of levelling up. It will cost jobs in Yorkshire and across the North where C has been investing for years.“Apprenticeships, HQ and support for independent productions companies are all at risk.”It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

But those still trying to crack the -letter code, look away now.   The Wordle for April  is ROYAL.  The game was created by software engineer, Josh Wardle, who recently announced he had sold the popular word game to the New York Times.In a statement on Twitter he wrote: “Since launching Wordle, I have been in awe of the response of everyone that has played.“The game has gotten bigger than I ever imagined .“It has been incredible to watch the game bring so much joy to so many and I feel so grateful for the personal stories some of you have shared with me – from Wordle uniting distant family members, to provoking friendly rivalries, to supporting medical recoveries.“On the flip side, I’d be lyingI said this hasn’t been overwhelming.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4576362.jpg--.jpg?1649424097000\n","title":"education minister visits ballymena primary school","story":" EDUCATION Minister Michelle McIlveen paid a recent visit to Ballymena Primary School.During the visit on March  the Minister spoke to members of the student bodies active within the school which included the School Council, Eco-Council and Digital Leaders.

The families are bringing in their ious harvests and making preparations for next year. It’s October, and on the shores of Strangford Lough the Elliott family rear turkeys. The family have years of experience looking after the birds and yet Mark and Olive are still fascinated by their behaviour. Olive comments that they are ‘extremely inquisitive’. While Mark is making sure the turkeys are well fed, his mum Olive can’t help giving them an extra treat. She comments too, “I can’t do without my family, I have to be so nice to them at the minute!” Mark points out that they have been receiving orders for Christmas since August, which is ‘absolutely nuts.’ Near Kilcoo in the Mourne Mountains, Aine Devlin is preparing her flock for the most critical part of her farming year- breeding season. Aine is keeping an eye on her rams to make sure they’re doing their job. She coats their chests with paint to see which ewes they have been with. Aine laughs, “This is his cologne for the girls!” For her AI is not the way to go as the ewes would then all lamb on the same day on the mountain. She loves this time of year and is proud of the part she plays in the economy. “What’s better than buying produce from down the road from your neighbours and local communities ” she says. Outside Crossgar, Richard Orr is thinking ahead to next year’s wheat crop. It’s all about the planning and attention to detail to make sure the groundwork is done right. He’s conscious of the environment, saying, “The major thing in the world is carbon footprint. Chemicals have made farming easy, and modern machinery has damaged the structure of the soil - we need to rebuild that.” Meanwhile, just outside Portadown it’s all hands on deck for apple harvest at the McKeever family farm. There isn’t a high yield this year but sometimes things not going to plan can be a blessing. Pat talks about the seven to eight weeks of hell and this year pickers have been hard to get. Peter comments, “It’s half the battle when you have good people around.” On the Donegal   Londonderry border, potato farmer Jamie Rankin and his team are coming towards the end of their harvest. He enjoys the early starts and says, “What you do before dinner time’s your day’s work.” While it’s a job Jamie enjoys, it also comes with challenges as winter months close in. The bad weather has led to reduced yields and a late harvest, but he’s very proud to have produced a good crop. UTV’s Mark McFadden narrates the series.

Start by thinking how much water you are using each day. Whether you are washing your hands, cleaning endless amounts of dishes or getting through that mountain of washing, you start to realise just how important water is and the sheer amount we use. NI Water’s Environmental Outreach  Learning Officer, Anna Killen, explains how we can save water by looking at everyday habits, “It’s amazing to think that each day each person uses around  litres of water! However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money! Why not try the  minute shower challenge, put on your favourite  minute song and seeyou can finish before the end.” To help you embed with these new habits and ‘Get Water Fit’, complete our online water audit at https:www.getwaterfit or take part in water saving challenges and receive your free water saving items including  minute shower timer, toothy timers and swell gel bags for the garden. Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold.

I have decided I cannot support the candidate that the party Executive have imposed upon the people of South Down.”He shared the news with local newspaper the County Down Outlook after the Belfastrevealed the turn of events which led Mr Wells to support TUV candidate Harold McKee – which could have seen the veteran politician expelled from the DUP. On Tuesday morning, Mr Wells admitted he walked before he was pushed after late on Monday night, he made the decision to contact senior members of the DUP to resign. I feel very strongly about this and I feel that Harold McKee is the best candidate to represent the unionist community of South Down,” he said.

Make no mistake. If on the Saturday morning after the election, Sinn Fein is the largest party there will be no more talk of the health service or rising costs, the focus will be on getting a Border Poll.“Therefore nothing should be done which would split the unionist vote. Although we don’t believe unionism has anything to fear from a Border Poll, it would be destabilising and a distraction from the important business we need to get on with.”They added: “This election is much more important than mere personalities. The seat totals after the count will decide whether Northern Ireland goes in the right or wrong direction and our priorities for the next five years.“Diane Forsythe secured the DUP’s best ever result in South Down in . She is a young mother, rooted in the Mournes with a plan for South Down. Diane will focus on what matters to people.”Mr Wells, meanwhile, arranged a photo-call with Mr McKee and the TUV leader on Monday. Former Ulster Unionist Mr McKee said he was delighted and honoured to have Mr Wells’ support.“In the end he was abandoned by his own party but it is the mark of the man that he wishes the best for South Down going forward,” added Mr McKee who quit the UUP for the TUV last October over the more liberal approach of Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie and his party’s stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and support for a ban on gay conversion therapy.He added: “I am delighted to have Jim’s support and gratied that a broad swathe of unionism is uniting behind me as the standard bearer of principled unionism.” TUV leader Mr Allister also joined in welcoming Jim Wells’ support but there was no comment on the prospect of him joining Mr McKee in the TUV ranks.“At critical times in Stormont Jim Wells was often the only MLA prepared to join me in doing what was right,” Mr Allister said.“In December  we were the only MLAs to speak and vote against  EU regulations essential to bedding in the iniquitous Protocol.“Putting party advantage before principle would have been easy, but Jim did the right thing and likewise today in backing Harold he is putting principle before party.”Mr Allister insisted the Wells backing would bolster the chances of Mr McKee in the tightly-fought constituency where unionist isions could hand the last of the five seats to Alliance or the SDLP.“In strengthening Harold McKee’s hand he is laying the foundation for the continuance in Stormont of South Down representation based on conviction politics. We’ve seen enough of synthetic unionism it’s good to offer the real thing with Jim Wells’ backing,” Mr Allister added.Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartyJim WellsTraditional Unionist VoiceSir Jeffrey DonaldsonEdwin PootsSinn FéinJim AllisterMore On Democratic Unionist Party PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionPastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI Protocol PremiumJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateUnionist councillors brand good relations group ‘a waste of time’ PremiumRight to protest against NI Protocol must be recognised, insists DUP MP Sammy WilsonMost Read‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerBarry’s: New name but still all the fun of the fair as amusements open in PortrushVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraTop VideosPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM PlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayVideo: ATO carry out controlled explosion on WW bomb at Murlough beachLatest Northern IrelandBelfast Giants team-mates sing Kevin Raine’s praises after defenceman lays it all on the line to help them claim Elite League titleNew £m apartment complex in Belfast awaits approval from councilWells resigns from DUP as he urges voters to back TUV candidateNI labour market recovery continues as number of payrolled employees increasesDUP veteran Wells urges voters to back candidate from TUVLatestBelfast Giants team-mates sing Kevin Raine’s praises after defenceman lays it all on the line to help them claim Elite League titleNew £m apartment complex in Belfast awaits approval from councilWells resigns from DUP as he urges voters to back TUV candidateOne dead as blast rips through building in LebanonWellness lessons: Feeling the fear and how you can overcome it,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amenities are to include private balconies, shared courtyards and shared roof terraces. Some  units are to be social housing.Lacuna Developments, Titanic Quarter Ltd and Belfast Harbour have teamed up with Welsh firm Watkin Jones Group for the development, which will be called ‘Loft Lines’.It will be a mix of private rented and social apartments, alongside recreational spaces, gyms and children’s play area. Loft Lines will also include a public area with a sports park for outdoor events and exercise classes called South Yard Square, while there will also be space for a coffee shop, restaurant and creche.According to planning documents submitted on behalf of the applicants: “The proposals describe a new, contemporary and sustainable residential development that is rooted in the qualities and history of the place and declares its future as an iconic waterfront neighbourhood. We want to express the three blocks as a cluster of urban objects around a new square. We believe each should have its own distinct qualities, derived from how it responds to its specic site and programmatic conditions, but should also feel related to its neighbours.“Dferent but the same. This ‘urban assembly’ has the potential to rest confidently on a prime site within the city — a backdrop to the river. This will be arguably the first mixed use, mixed tenure residential development in this area of the city, providing much needed homes for people of all ages and backgrounds.“A mix of social and affordable housing , alongside build to rentis proposed delivering a choice by providing ,  and  bedroom apartments and studios for rent, alongside social and affordable accommodation to meet a range of needs.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up According to a briefing document prepared for members of Belfast City Council’s planning committee, consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and Belfast City Airport have no objection to the proposals, subject to conditions.The document states the development would cost around £m and generate an estimated  full-time equivalent construction jobs over three years.“The three buildings are referred to as Blocks ,  and a. Blocks  and a are proposed for Build to Rentblocks whilst Block  is proposed for social housingwith the remainder being managed by the Housing Association for private rental.

Credit: Chris Ison PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIt comes after the Belfastrevealed how some students here are leaving university with debts of up to £,.According to the Student Loans Company , student loan over-repayments happen because of the nature of the loan repayment scheme, known as Income Contingent Repayment .Up until April , the SLC received student loan repayment information each year from HMRC, and as a result of this process some borrowers nearing the end of their repayments might overpay, the SLC said.Since April , HMRC has sent SLC student loan repayment information as reported by employers on a weekly basis, known as More Frequent Data Sharing, which the SLC says has helped reduce overpayments, but they still might happen unless a borrower switches to the direct debit scheme when eligible to do so.According to the latest figures, in the   financial year, a total of , graduates from Northern Ireland overpaid in their student loan repayments to the tune of £.m. The average overpayment per graduate was £.Figures also show , graduates received refunds in   and , graduates were awaiting a refund, as of January  this year. Since  , overpayments from NI students have totalled £,,. The total amount of overpayments has been falling in recent years, from a high of just over £m in  .The SLC said: Over recent years, a number of initiatives have been introduced to reduce over-repayments and improve the repayment process for SLC customers including introduction of the Online Repayment Service, automatic refunds and encouraging uptake of the direct debit scheme.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The frequency of data received from HMRC has also increased from annually to weekly. Additionally, further campaigns have been run to contact customers who have over-repaid, advising them to claim their refund. Therefore, these changes have reduced over-repayments and the decrease reported reflects this.Ellen Fearon of the student body NUS-USI said the SLC needs to ensure it places as much emphasis on locating graduates who have over-repaid as it would tracking down those it believes owe it money”.“In many cases, the SLC will no longer have accurate contact information to alert people they are owed money, so we would encourage all those who have repaid their loans to consider getting in touch with SLC to seethey are eligible for a refund and ensure their details on record are correct, she said.“It is also important for graduates to check their payslips and student loan statements to understand when the loan expires, which can address any overpayment. Ultimately, the SLC must reduce the incidence of overpayments by updating its systems and how it works with HMRC.”Alliance Party economy spokesperson Stewart Dickson added: It is challenging enough for graduates to repay student loans without some people making overpayments. Better systems should be in place to prevent this from happening in the first place. Refunds should be made quickly and I would encourage former students to check repayment schedules once they begin.”The SLC said: “We want to make it as easy as possible for customers in repayment to manage their student loan accounts and over the last two years we have made a number of improvements to help customers avoid over repaying.Our Prevent Over Repaymentscheme enables customers to switch to Direct Debit in the final years of payment as over repaying is entirely avoidable. In addition, our new Online Repayment Servicegives customers much more control over their repayment journey.”The news comes after figures obtained by the Belfastshowed that the level of student debt for NI graduates is topping £, in some cases. One person from here has a student debt balance of more than £,, while over , others have debts of between £, and £,.Figures released via a Freedom of Information request show the top five highest student loan balances of students from Northern Ireland are £, £, £, £, and £,.Read MoreNorthern Ireland students ‘burdened with debts of almost £k’Related topicsStewart DicksonAlliance PartyMore On Stewart DicksonPO Ferries ‘trying to save face’ with £m package for dismissed workersEconomy Minister Gordon Lyons rules out financial support to help people working from homeChancellor must cut duty on fuel and ease burden of cost of living crisis, says Alliance MLA Stewart DicksonPO jobs cull leaves ferry users high and dry PremiumRevealed: % of Northern Ireland’s commercial property lies vacantMost Read‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerBarry’s: New name but still all the fun of the fair as amusements open in PortrushVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraTop VideosPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM PlayVideo: ATO carry out controlled explosion on WW bomb at Murlough beachPlayFootage of an attack on police in Killough Co DownLatest Northern IrelandNI labour market recovery continues as number of payrolled employees increasesDUP veteran Wells urges voters to back candidate from TUVTwo more rural schools to seek integrated statusSteven BeacomOpinionHave Mick McDermott#s Twitter rants erted Glentoran’s attention from a title race they once controlled Multi-million apartment complex in Belfast awaits approval from councilLatestWellness lessons: Feeling the fear and how you can overcome itTen steps to protecting your sexual healthRosie Tennyson on why she’s walking km for cancer research after rare diagnosis led to leg amputationNI labour market recovery continues as number of payrolled employees increasesUse of chemical weapons by Russia would be ‘beyond the pale’, minister warns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Press Eye FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDUP candidate Diane Forsythe. Credit: Press EyeLisa SmythTwitterApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe DUP has defended the low number of female candidates it is running in next month’s Assembly elections.With just a quarter of women making its list of candidates, the DUP has the lowest number of females in the running for election out of Northern Ireland’s five main political parties.By contrast, % of Sinn Fein candidates are women, followed by the Alliance Party, where half of its runners are female. The SDLP is next, with % of candidates women, while a third of the UUP’s runners are female.The DUP’s South Down candidate has rejected accusations of gender bias and said the party does not run females as a tick box exercise.Diane Forsythe, who has replaced Jim Wells as the DUP’s candidate after  years at Stormont, said: “I am an accountant and mother of three young children.“I am the only DUP candidate in this constituency.“A lot of parties field female candidates in seats where they have little chance of winning or they field women as a second candidate but then ide the area in way which makes it very dficult for the female candidate to win. This shouldn’t be about tokenism.

We need more role models and I hope that the exceptional candidates we are standing at this election will be future leaders in our party and society.“We are not yet there yet, but I am absolutely committed to taking us in the right direction.”Connie Egan, who is running for the Alliance Party in North Down, welcomed the gender make-up of her party’s candidates which she said had happened without a quota being set. However, she said more needs to be done to tackle sexism faced by female candidates: “We each have a role to play in ensuring we continue to encourage more women to participate.”Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartySDLPAlliance PartyNorthern Ireland AssemblyJim WellsDoug BeattieMore On Democratic Unionist Party PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionPastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI Protocol PremiumJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateUnionist councillors brand good relations group ‘a waste of time’ PremiumRight to protest against NI Protocol must be recognised, insists DUP MP Sammy WilsonMost Read‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerBarry’s: New name but still all the fun of the fair as amusements open in PortrushVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraTop VideosPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM PlayVideo: ATO carry out controlled explosion on WW bomb at Murlough beachPlayFootage of an attack on police in Killough Co DownLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Pastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI ProtocolJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From mysterious rally organisers and a problem in East Antrim to an SDLP sing-songColum Eastwood urges people to vote tactically and lend SDLP their vote, as he launches election campaignNorthern Ireland Assembly election: Who will top the poll in your constituency and whose seat is at risk LatestWellness lessons: Feeling the fear and how you can overcome itTen steps to protecting your sexual healthRosie Tennyson on why she’s walking km for cancer research after rare diagnosis led to leg amputationNI labour market recovery continues as number of payrolled employees increasesUse of chemical weapons by Russia would be ‘beyond the pale’, minister warns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is

on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway

as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside

figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide

Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility.

We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up. Congratulations to the lucky winners who snagged bottles of wine and Easter eggs.Patrick Smith even won a free entry to Comber K.

Gerard, who is a volunteer for the Glens Red Squirrel Group the second longest Red Squirrel conservation group in Northern Ireland, Gerard was nominated by the Glens group for the outstanding work he does with the the group across the Glens and beyond supporting and advising those interested in red squirrel conservation.During his years volunteering, Gerard has worked endlessly to conserve native red squirrels, he has played a key role in many projects including educational and habitat enhancement projects within Glenshek and across the nine Glens of Antrim. Mark Henderson from the Red Squirrel Survival Trust travelled to the Glens of Antrim to present the David Stapleford Award for Volunteer of the Year to Greard. It was Mark’s first time in Northern Ireland and he visited many of the Glens Red Squirrel Groups feeding sites and projects across the Glens. He visited Cregagh Wood Hide in Glendun where the hide is managed by the GRSG. While there along with Gerard, Mark was able to see two Red Squirrels feeding and playing together. Mark Henderson commented: “We’re delighted to present Gerard with the Volunteer of the Year award. Gerard and his team’s devotion to the protection of red squirrels is evident in the work he is doing in County Antrim. Red squirrels rely hugely on the support of volunteers, and we enjoy being able to celebrate the work they do.”Gerard said: “I was surprised to be nominated let alone win. I’m chuffed and embarrassed in equal measures. I think it’s a reflection of what we do as a group rather than what I do myself.”To find out more about the Glens Red Squirrel Group visit https:glensredsquirrelgroup  or go to Facebook and search ‘Glens Red Squirrel Group’.Read More Read MoreRed Arrows toto this year’s NI International Air Show  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularToome bypass tragedy: police release name of crash victim...NewsToome road tragedy: woman dies after crash and man is arrest...NewsLurgan stabbings: man arrested on two counts of attempted mu...NewsLarge turnout of mourners at funeral of Lee Usher...NewsMagherafelt motorist who hit another car was ‘blinded by gla...NewsMost PopularTaste test: we review the best and worst supermarket Easter ...RecommendedStylish armchairs UK: where to buy great living room chairs,...RecommendedBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep y...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...RecommendedBest home treadmills UK : stay fit with an at-home tread...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQHtVU sc-fvNpTx bzDFfj FgnDh\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"wit wisdom this too shall pass ","story":"Larne man banned from driving for three years   Toome bypass tragedy: police release name of crash victimNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsAdam Harbinson. WIT  WISDOM: This too shall passWith our recent fine weather I’ve been doing more than my usual five-to- miles a day walking, an activity that, with many of my countrymen, I developed during the lockdown, when there was little  to do, writes Adam Harbinson.By The NewsroomSunday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Last week was idyllic as I walked along the Donegal coast from Moville to Greencastle it was magical, and it struck me again, that while we all know the value of regular exercise, fresh air and social engagement, we might never really know just how beneficial such days are for our physical and mental health.But what perhaps, on the flipside, will our memories of - be in  years time  We’ll be asking ourselves, how on Earth did we remain sane  Brexit has wreaked havoc on our economy, piled on top of which was Covid-. I can still feel the cloud of gloom that settled on me when a radio announcer was suggesting that all over s would not be allowed outside the door of their homes for  weeks.Thankfully it didn’t quite come to that.Then came the murderous war in Ukraine, with pictures being flashed onto our screens of European families hiding in cellars in fear or their lives, not to mention the bloody carnage. But how does this bad news affect our mental health To further exacerbate my potential for anxiety I can tell you that five of my close friends and family members are suffering from le-threatening health problems one has even invited me to his rd birthday party, when he and I know full well that in reality it’s a ‘going away’ party. I’m in my mid-s and while I feel as mentally and physically fit as I was in my s, the thing I hate about my age is that so many of my contemporaries are dropping like flies.So, what can we do to protect ourselves  Firstly we must regulate our intake of deadly news regular exercise and getting out into the countryside is helpful too. Gratitude is of vital importance, so let’s get a pen and paper and make a list of the many aspects of our lives for which we can be truly grateful.But is that enough  You might say no, but since there might be little we can do to help our suffering brothers and sisters, we must recognise the need for serenity to accept the things we cannot change and thecourage to change the things we can.One thing’s for sure this too will pass.

The leguards carried out thousands of preventative actions over the summer period which saw an estimated , visitors.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Over the past few weeks, they have been training and practicing their skills so that they are ready to face what the upcoming season brings.The RNLI will carry out its usual leguard service this year across Northern Ireland in its standard phased approach. The first set of beaches will go on service from this Good Friday,  April, for the Easter holidays. Leguards will patrol beaches at Benone, Portrush East Strand, Portrush West Strand, Whiterocks and Ballycastle from am to pm and Portstewart from am-pm daily until Sunday  April.A weekend service on these beaches will commence on Saturday  April and will run until the peak daily season starts on Saturday  June. Meanwhile, a weekend service on Tyrella Beach in county Down will start from am to pm on Saturday  April.Speaking ahead of the Easter leguard service commencing, Karl O’Neill, RNLI Lead Leguard Supervisor said: “RNLI leguards are at the forefront of the charity’s lesaving work, as they keep beach visitors safe across the Causeway Coast and in county Down each year. Last year’s figures show the importance of our leguards and what they do for the public. We are expecting coastal areas to be just as busy in the summer season ahead.“The RNLI has been working closely with partners and local communities to ensure beaches and leguard units are ready and equipped, and that leguard training has been performed seamlessly.“Pre-season preparations have gone well, and our leguards are ready to get back on to the beaches and do what they do best offering preventative safety advice to visitors and rescuing those in dficulty in the water or on the beach itself.“However, it is important to remember that our leguards can’t be everywhere. Our leguards will be supported by the charity’s   leboat service and water safety work, but we urge anyone visiting the coast to take responsibility for themselves and their family.”Conard McCullough, RNLI Lead Leguard Supervisor added: “Heading to coastal waters is a great way to have fun and stay active, especially during the summer months. But weather conditions can change quickly and,you’re not careful, you can easily get caught out.“It is important that anyone visiting the coast understands the hazards of the environment. It can be an unpredictable environment, particularly during early summer when the risk of cold water shock signicantly increases, as air temperatures warm but water temperatures remain dangerously cold. We would remind anyone entering the water to take extra care and avoid unnecessary risks as early season conditions are more challenging.“Taking basic precautions can greatly reduce the risk of getting into dficulty and improve your chance of being found quickly should you need rescuing. With this in mind, we urge beach visitors to come dressed appropriately to ensure your visit is both safe and enjoyable. For activities like paddleboarding, we’d recommend you wear a wetsuit, as it will keep you warm in an emergency. Wearing an appropriate buoyancy aid or lejacket is also vital as is carrying a means of calling for help such as a mobile phone in a waterproof pouch.”The RNLI is urging anyone visiting the coast this Easter to make sure they keep themselves and their families safe by following beach safety advice:Visit a leguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flagsCheck the weather forecast, tide times and read local hazard signage to understand local risksKeep a close eye on your family – on the beach and in the water – don’t allow your family to swim aloneIf you fall into water unexpectedly, float to live. Fight your instinct to thrash around, lean back, extend your arms and legs, and float.In an emergency, dial  or  and ask for the Coastguard.Read more: New date for Raft Race RNLINorthern IrelandCauseway Coast  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularToome bypass tragedy: police release name of crash victim...NewsToome road tragedy: woman dies after crash and man is arrest...NewsLurgan stabbings: man arrested on two counts of attempted mu...NewsLarge turnout of mourners at funeral of Lee Usher...NewsMagherafelt motorist who hit another car was ‘blinded by gla...NewsMost PopularTaste test: we review the best and worst supermarket Easter ...RecommendedStylish armchairs UK: where to buy great living room chairs,...RecommendedBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep y...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...RecommendedBest home treadmills UK : stay fit with an at-home tread...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQHtVU sc-fvNpTx bzDFfj FgnDh\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The eagerly anticipated successor to the popular Barrys Amusements opened its doors for the first time on Saturday amid great excitement. Hundreds of people young and old filed through the doors all afternoon as the magic ed to Portmagic - and just in time for Easter. The good news is that Currys is now up and running, boasting all the old Barrys favourites and adding some new ones too. And for those with old Barrys tokens - no, you cant use them, but you can help the RNLI by dropping them into collection boxes dotted around the complex. The fun park has chosen the charity as its partner - a thoughtful gesture given the important work volunteers do in the waters off the north coast. But for now, after two years of zero craic because of the pandemic, all roads lead to the Port and what promises to be a fun-filled holiday period.

The families are bringing in their ious harvests and making preparations for next year. It’s October, and on the shores of Strangford Lough the Elliott family rear turkeys. The family have years of experience looking after the birds and yet Mark and Olive are still fascinated by their behaviour. Olive comments that they are ‘extremely inquisitive’. While Mark is making sure the turkeys are well fed, his mum Olive can’t help giving them an extra treat. She comments too, “I can’t do without my family, I have to be so nice to them at the minute!” Mark points out that they have been receiving orders for Christmas since August, which is ‘absolutely nuts.’ Near Kilcoo in the Mourne Mountains, Aine Devlin is preparing her flock for the most critical part of her farming year- breeding season. Aine is keeping an eye on her rams to make sure they’re doing their job. She coats their chests with paint to see which ewes they have been with. Aine laughs, “This is his cologne for the girls!” For her AI is not the way to go as the ewes would then all lamb on the same day on the mountain. She loves this time of year and is proud of the part she plays in the economy. “What’s better than buying produce from down the road from your neighbours and local communities ” she says. Outside Crossgar, Richard Orr is thinking ahead to next year’s wheat crop. It’s all about the planning and attention to detail to make sure the groundwork is done right. He’s conscious of the environment, saying, “The major thing in the world is carbon footprint. Chemicals have made farming easy, and modern machinery has damaged the structure of the soil - we need to rebuild that.” Meanwhile, just outside Portadown it’s all hands on deck for apple harvest at the McKeever family farm. There isn’t a high yield this year but sometimes things not going to plan can be a blessing. Pat talks about the seven to eight weeks of hell and this year pickers have been hard to get. Peter comments, “It’s half the battle when you have good people around.” On the Donegal   Londonderry border, potato farmer Jamie Rankin and his team are coming towards the end of their harvest. He enjoys the early starts and says, “What you do before dinner time’s your day’s work.” While it’s a job Jamie enjoys, it also comes with challenges as winter months close in. The bad weather has led to reduced yields and a late harvest, but he’s very proud to have produced a good crop. UTV’s Mark McFadden narrates the series. Sponsored by Moy Park, ‘Rare Breed – A Farming Year’ continues on Tuesday th April at pm on UTV.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cedefbbefdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dadbdaacafbad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649684275157.jpg--april_showers__keep_them_shorter_.jpg?164968427500","title":"april showers keep them shorter ","story":"Spring has finally sprung and with rising energy costs there is no better time to dust off old habits and create some new ones that are good for your pocket and the environment. Start by thinking how much water you are using each day. Whether you are washing your hands, cleaning endless amounts of dishes or getting through that mountain of washing, you start to realise just how important water is and the sheer amount we use. NI Water’s Environmental Outreach  Learning Officer, Anna Killen, explains how we can save water by looking at everyday habits, “It’s amazing to think that each day each person uses around  litres of water! However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money! Why not try the  minute shower challenge, put on your favourite  minute song and seeyou can finish before the end.” To help you embed with these new habits and ‘Get Water Fit’, complete our online water audit at https:www.getwaterfit or take part in water saving challenges and receive your free water saving items including  minute shower timer, toothy timers and swell gel bags for the garden. Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold.
