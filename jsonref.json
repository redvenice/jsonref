The brain registers the majority of information about flavour via millions of olfactory (smell) cells, so that is why the cider must be swirled in the glass to release aromas. A wine glass is best for doing this, but don’t fill it to the brim as the cider needs space to breathe so the aromas develop. Gently swirl the cider a couple of times and sniff it. Then take a sip and let the cider cover the tongue. More aromas will be released and travel to the nasal cavity through the back of the throat. Think about what you smell and taste, the cider’s body, the texture, the overall drinking experience. Then repeat. That’s how to taste cider! All-occasion quaffing: Thatchers Gold Thatchers’ flagship cider, Gold, is a blend of several apple varieties. Eating apples bestow Thatchers Gold fruitiness and a satisfying “bite”, while cider apples including two of the undisputed superstars – dabinett and Harry Masters Jersey – give body and depth to the flavour. Thatchers Gold is an eminently quaffable cider for all occasions with ripe and juicy green apple aromas and flavours bursting from the glass, a sherbet-like mouthfeel with gentle carbonation, and a refreshing tang. If you are a wine drinker looking for a cider to suit your palate then Thatchers Gold will appeal to fans of viognier. Pair with grilled sea bass, or satay vegetables if you’re veggie. Cheshire cheese is a great match too its slight saltiness will contract the cider’s underlying sweetness. Crisp and cloudy: Thatchers HazeThatchers Haze brims with fruitiness from a blend of fruit bowl favourites: discovery, falstaff, gala and jonagold. Cider made from eating apples tends to be light-bodied and crisp, and Thatchers Haze is no exception. A solid entry-level blend for those wishing to explore cider more deeply on the nose and palate it has green apples, pears, banana, a hint of lemon, an effervescent mouthfeel, and a sweet tangy finish. The cider’s distinct natural cloudiness is thanks to jonagold apple juice adding a sweetness that makes Thatchers Haze match especially well with spicy foods, such as falafel burgers, or spicy pork stir-fry. For wine drinkers, if you imagine riesling with that easy-drinking fruitiness and refreshing acidity, then Thatchers Haze will appeal to the same palate. The solo star: Thatchers KatyWhile most ciders are made from blending different apple varieties, Thatchers Katy is a single-variety cider. Made from the popular eating apple of the same name, it is fresh and fruity with a subtle sweetness, a refreshing acidity, tingling carbonation and crisp, tangy finish. Thatchers ferments Katy apples with a type of yeast that sparkling wine producers use, enhancing the flavour. However, there’s evidence to suggest it was 17th-century West Country cider makers who first experimented with secondary fermentation to add a natural sparkle to the drink, some time before champagne was invented – so you could say that cider was the original sparkling tipple. Take the flute challenge – pour a glass of Thatchers Katy and a glass of prosecco and blind taste them – which is the wine and which is the premium cider? Thatchers Katy is perfect as an aperitif and for dining. Food-wise, go for lighter textured food with delicate flavours, such as grilled cod and asparagus risotto. For a cheese match, the savoury salty flavours of parmesan are a contrast to the fruity sweetness of Thatchers Katy. Sweet explosion: Thatchers RoséWaves of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavours refresh the mouth. Thatchers Rosé cider is made exclusively from those dessert apple favourites cripps pink, gala and fuji. Sweet fruitiness pops and fizzes across your tongue, before the mouth is filled with a zingy texture. It’s a light and easy-drinking cider that suits being well chilled. Drink it for refreshment at a picnic, or treat it as a dessert cider to be enjoyed with Eton mess or summer pudding. Full-bodied and spiced: Thatchers Rascal Imagine if apple pie came in a glass. Rascal is the cider equivalent, with a scrumptious array of flavours including red apples, pears, demerara sugar and spice. Created with a blend of cider apple stalwarts – redstreak, dabinett and tremlett’s bitter – this bold cider contains tannins that give the cider a fuller mouthfeel than the ciders made with eating or dessert apples. Tannins attract fats and proteins, cut through the texture of dense and fatty food and refresh the mouth. So pair with hearty meals such as a Sunday roast or mac and cheese, followed by apple crumble and custard. Equally, this is an excellent sitting-in-your-favourite-pub-and-chatting with your friends type of cider.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

The terms of reference issued by the government signal the review will indeed examine the game’s finances, ownership and whether it now needs independent regulation. The Premier League itself is now so publicly split between the six and the other 14 who stood up so adamantly against the breakaway that it will struggle to present a united response to the government’s review. The league did that successfully in response to many previous inquiries, dazzling governments with the global reach of the English game and the clubs’ admirable community work, and fending off those who argued for fundamental reform. In the past year, however, after both Conservative and Labour politicians were already bewildered at the collapses of Bury and Wigan despite football’s greatest boom, the pandemic has spotlit the glaring financial inequalities very starkly. While the big clubs are apparently obsessing about their own losses and a desire for more control of future broadcasting revenues, including from streaming their matches to their global fanbases, ministers grew intensely frustrated at the Premier League’s delay in agreeing a Covid-19 rescue fund for EFL clubs that were seriously struggling. Then, with the return of normal life finally in sight after the pandemic’s horror and sacrifice, the rich clubs unleashed their Super League money-grab instead of a plan, as Uefa said, to rebuild the sport together. As well as spectacularly highlighting English football’s faultlines, all this has shone a light on the possible solutions – particularly the less corporate German model, given the non-participation of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in the Super League. With Boris Johnson having threatened a “legislative bomb” to stop the breakaway, a feeling is growing that – surprising as it is under a Conservative government – the combination of circumstances has produced a historic opportunity for genuine change. The Football Supporters’ Association, whose recommendations have often been indulged but not implemented, is now a central participant in the fan-led review. Ideas for reforming the game in its post-1992 Premier League era of mega-commercialisation have always been based on the yearning to protect its sporting heart and communal soul, and never very complicated for the famously simple, beautiful game. Shaped for today’s circumstances, just a few overarching proposals could fulfil that function and are likely to be considered by the fan-led review and its chair, the former sports minister Tracey Crouch. These five changes are ideas whose time may finally have come. One of the most exasperating elements of the Super League plan to almost everybody else was the repeated sense from Real Madrid, Liverpool, Arsenal and the other richest clubs in Europe that somehow the system isn’t working for them. While they nurse their losses from the Covid-19 shutdown and were wowed by projections from the merchant bank, JP Morgan, of how much money they could be making, the rest of the game argues the distribution needs to flow the other way – more equally. When a sport becomes so grossly unequal, dominated on and off the field by billionaire-owned corporations, it is betraying its heritage, as the fans’ outcry against the Super League has shown. Distribution of money is an essential component of competitive sport the sharing of gate receipts by home and away clubs was agreed at the Football League’s very founding in 1888. The US sports in which the owners of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal own “franchises” distribute TV and commercial revenues very equally, to ensure relatively even teams create genuine competition. During English football’s dash for cash, many local club owners made multimillions selling their shares to overseas investors, free of historic Football Association rules that had restrained the personal gains that could be made from owning clubs. The football corporations now dominating the Premier League, wholly owned by investors, are an outcome of this deregulation. As fans cannot afford to buy meaningful stakes in these club-corporations, an idea is a “golden share” structure, in which a properly constituted supporters association would have voting control over defined significant decisions. These would include any fundamental changes at their own club but can also include wider issues, including resisting any talk of breakaways. This was actively floated in this week’s fallout by Julian Knight, Conservative chair of the culture, media and sport select committee. He and fellow MPs have been schooled in football’s brutal realities by their inquiry into the 2019 wreck of Bury after 125 years of Football League membership, and their fury at the Premier League’s delay in agreeing a Covid-19 rescue fund. That has embedded a view that the clubs themselves need proper involvement of supporters to ground them in collective responsibility. Work remains to be done to develop a proposal, including how a supporter representative would be appointed, presumably involving some democratic election. Clubs may resist it but improved liaison with supporter groups currently has limited impact on boards’ decision-making, and clearly fans were not consulted before six clubs hurtled into the Super League dead end. The existing “fit and proper persons test” for owners and directors is itself an illustration of the football authorities being pushed by campaigners into reform for their own good. The Premier League resisted introducing such a test for years, arguing it could be illegal, until the Football League finally introduced some rules in June 2004 and the Premier League followed in August of that year. The current rule, which bars people who are insolvent or have unspent convictions, is a bare minimum safeguard. It needs widening to consider wider modern issues and more broadly to encourage owners who will be good custodians. A further idea is for the test to be ongoing, so that owners sign up to abiding by all agreed rules, structures and governance. If they consider breaching them – for example, by forming a breakaway Super League – they risk falling foul of the rule and being banned at least as directors of their own clubs. After so many years in which this idea has been floated but resisted by the FA and leagues, independent regulation is coming to seem like a reform whose time has come. The sense has hardened that while the game is flourishing more than ever but harbouring structural faults it cannot any longer regulate itself. The FA should have this role as the governing body but it has been sorely weakened by Premier League resistance and become largely absent from the biggest questions of money and power. An independent regulator could work by formally holding the game to abiding by its reformed structures, including the more equal sharing of money – and to agreed standards on fighting racism and other fundamental issues. These could also include the game’s “consumer” issues, including making tickets and televised matches more affordable after the years of hyper-inflated prices. It may seem far-fetched that a Conservative government could consider regulation in this way, but Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, recognised this week that football is a part of national heritage that needs protecting. Inadvertently, the richest clubs, with their extreme actions, have spectacularly made the case for this themselves."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Biden tells world leaders that no government can address climate threat on its ownStepped-up emissions goal announced by host provides tangible break from climate denialist presidency of Donald TrumpUS attempts to underline its climate credentials by committing to halving its emissions by 2030"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 state regulator reports serious clotting events linked to astrazeneca jab","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that he has real hope and confidence about the continued easing of Covid-19 restrictions, but has warned that the country is not yet where we need to be. Video: RTÉThe Health Protection Regulatory Authority says the vast majority of side effects are mild to moderate in nature, and the benefits of Covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the risks. Photograph: Gent ShkullakuAFPSerious blood clotting events in people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine have been reported by the State’s medicines regulator for the first time.The Health Protection Regulatory Authority says it has received “a small number” (under five) reports of blood clotting-type events combined with low platelets in people who received the jab.In a vaccine safety update, the authority said these were among a total 29 reports of blood clotting events of all types that it had received.“In these cases, the iniduals concerned sought medical attention, received specialist medical care and are reported to be responding well to treatment.”Of the report of clotting without low platelets, the authority says the vast majority describe clots typically seen in the general population, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and many of those affected had risk factors for clotting. Similar types of clotting – but without low platelets – have been observed with mRNA vaccines, it points out, with 41 such reports received.A total of 6,616 reports of suspected side effects have been notified so far, arising from the administration of more than 1.15 million vaccine doses. The authority says the vast majority of side effects are mild to moderate in nature, and that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the risks.Rare side effectTwo weeks after it concluded that unusual blood clots were a rare side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to publish updated European data on Friday.In Ireland, use of the AstraZeneca vaccine was restricted to over-60s following the EMA decision, thereby further disrupting the overall vaccine rollout.This was compounded when similar issues arose with the Johnson\u0026ampJohnson vaccine, a decision on the use of which is due from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).There was disappointment and some anger in Government circles that Niac did not respond to pressure to produce recommendations on the use of the vaccine, before the weekend. Ministers had hoped that the Health Service Executive would be cleared to begin use of Johnson\u0026ampJohnson shots early next week, but Niac indicated on Thursday that it would not be making any recommendations before next week.Sources said it was a clear rebuff to Government, with a number criticising Niac for a lack of urgency. One Minister described the delays as “madness”.Approval expectedGovernment sources still expect Niac to approve use of the vaccine, which Ireland expects to get 600,000 doses of before the end of June and 2.1 million before the end of the year.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, who last night returned to the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) press briefing for the first time in two months, said he expected Niac to provide its advice early next week and that there would not be unnecessary delays to the programme.HSE chief executive Paul Reid had earlier said that if Niac restricted the use of the Johnson\u0026ampJohnson vaccine it would “significantly” affect the rollout of the State programme.New Covid-19 cases on Thursday hit a three-week high of 617, but public health officials hope the increase – driven by school outbreaks, workplace clusters and infections linked to funerals and wakes – will be transient.Dr Holohan said he still thought “we’re moving in the right direction”. He said there are “reasons for real hope” that Ireland “can confidently move to a point” where an easing of restrictions can be recommended.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 240,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,800 people have died.Globally, over 140 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 88\u0026nbspdifferent vaccines in clinical development, with another 184 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine.

Photograph: EPAUS president Joe Biden’s commitment to halve that country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 has boosted Earth Day, ensuring Irish climate policy can no longer be considered an outrider, according to top Irish environmentalists and academics. Prof Diarmuid Torney, a climate policy expert at Dublin City University, said the announcement by the United States this week showed how society and business are now using Earth Day to showcase their endeavours. “On one hand you can say that is window dressing. On the other hand, announcements by the US and by companies provide an opportunity to hold them to account,” he said. Friends of the Earth director Oisín Coghlan said return of the US to the climate action fold was a “shot in the arm” for that movement.“The US commitment is significant, coming on the back of the EU also committing to reduce emissions. This is a real and substantial downpayment,” he said. For Mr Coghlan that move means Irish policy is no longer an outlier. “What Ireland is committing to do is in line with the EU and the US. We are no longer on a mad solo run.”However, he added it would be difficult for each sector to deliver its fair share. “We have seen that already in the opening position of the Department of Agriculture. It is giving a 10 per cent cut and in the context of an overall 50 per cent cut that is not adequate. If agriculture cuts by 10 per cent the other sectors will have to cut by 73 per cent,” he said. Prof Torney said the new Climate Bill is a huge improvement on the 2015 one as different sectors can no longer “pass the buck”.“Transport is going to be really challenging. Agriculture is obviously challenging. It’s not compatible with continued expansion of the beef and dairy sectors.”Irish politicians reactFor those who represent those sectors, it’s going be very difficult. Wexford Independent TD Verona Murphy has a background in road haulage and noted the EU policy on a move to rail freight.“Is it going to be possible to put rail freight on a small island of 700km when you have a road infrastructure that is almost 100 per cent connected? Our busiest port in the country now is Rosslare. It has no facility to take rail freight.”She also said technology to replace fossil fuels in large freight trucks was at least a decade away. Tipperary Fianna Fáil TD and former president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association Jackie Cahill said agriculture could meet many of its obligations by embracing new technology, in feed, silage, slurry spreading and fertilisers. Asked about cutting the national herd, which many believe is necessary in order to agriculture to meet its commitments, he replied: “I would not accept that. We are very sustainable producers of cattle. If we cut it here we have to import it from someone else which is less sustainable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"high street stroll reveals ravaged retail landscape","story":"Boarded-up  premises on Oxford Street: A report this week says more than 720,000 businesses in Britain are in “significant financial distress”. Photograph:  Leon NealGetty A week of fine days has filled the outdoor terraces of London’s bars and restaurants and brought shoppers back into the West End to spend their money in person for the first time in months. But a walk down Oxford Street reveals the extent of the damage to Britain’s retail landscape with one shopfront in eight boarded up.\u0026nbsp“Be the Future of a Global Flagship Opportunity,” reads an estate agent’s sign over the door of the huge, empty former Top Shop at Oxford Circus. Farther west towards Marble Arch, a boarded-up, neoclassical building vacated by Forever 21 two years ago looks across the street at a shop first opened by HMV in 1921, now also closed down.“Reinventing the Nation’s High Street”, boasts a hoarding hiding an empty site, advertising a plan for a greener, smarter future for “Oxford Street District” at the centre of a “world-leading, forward-facing urban district”. There are boarded-up shopfronts along Bond Street too but most of the luxury goods stores have reopened, waiting for international travel to come back, and with it the rich tourists who are their best customers.As Britain moves through the stages of its roadmap towards reopening the economy, there is growing evidence that it will come too late for many businesses. A report this week said that more than 720,000 businesses are in “significant financial distress”, with county court judgments against them for unpaid debts or a dramatic deterioration in their financial position.‘Zombie businesses’Julie Palmer from Begbies Traynor, the insolvency company that published the data, said a dam of “zombie businesses” could be about to break as government support proves inadequate to keep them afloat.“Opening the doors of consumer-facing businesses on April 12th may well seem like a big step in the right direction for many of these companies as they try to shake off the traumatic trading of the last 12 months. However, our experience shows that unmanageable levels of debts and subsequent overtrading are likely to be the hidden icebergs waiting to sink even the highest-profile businesses,” she said.The withdrawal of government support in the autumn will leave many companies exposed to the full scale of their debt and Britain’s insolvency rate is likely to rise by 50 per cent, the company said.It is not just businesses that have been taking on more debt during the pandemic but households too, according to the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on low and middle incomes. In a study comparing the financial resilience of households in Britain, France and Germany, the foundation discovered that 17 per cent of people in Britain whose incomes fell during the pandemic took on debt to cover living expenses, compared with 9 per cent in Germany and 8 per cent in France.The study cautions against the assumption that money saved during the pandemic because of restrictions on eating out, going to bars and other forms of social consumption will be available for a shopping spree now that the economy is reopening.Low-income households“While this pent-up consumption for some is reason for thinking that spending can recover quickly as lockdown restrictions are eased, this picture masks more worrying developments among those who have experienced an income shock,” it says.British households on low incomes entered the pandemic with more non-mortgage debt than their French and German counterparts and they will struggle more to overcome the impact of job losses or reduced wages. This is because welfare payments in Britain are less generous and more short-lived than in France and Germany.If those on low and middle incomes in Britain lack resilience, the poorest have been more vulnerable than ever during the pandemic. A record 2.5 million food parcels were given to people across Britain over the past year, with almost a million going to children.The Trussell Trust, which runs Britain’s biggest network of food banks, said it experienced a 33 per cent increase in need during the pandemic. It said the people who needed food parcels, including emergency parcels with enough food for one person for three days, were simply destitute.“Hunger in the UK isn’t about food, it’s about people not having enough money for the basics and, with high rates of unemployment and record redundancies, more people than ever need\u0026nbspthe social\u0026nbspsecurity system\u0026nbspto provide\u0026nbspa strong enough lifeline to stay\u0026nbspafloat,” the charity said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"us emissions move boosts efforts to keep global temperature rise to within 1 5 degrees","story":"The Biden administration has pledged to slash US greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, a new target it hopes will spur other big emitter countries to raise their ambition to combat climate change. Video: Reuters‘We need to care for nature, so that nature may care for us,’ said the pope. Photograph: Getty ImagesEfforts to contain the rise in global temperature to within 1.5 degrees have received a strong boost, with the United States declaring it is to halve its carbon emissions by 2030.The announcement was made in advance of a global summit on climate ambition hosted by President Joe Biden, which was addressed by 40 heads of state.The move by the world’s second-leading emitter after China is an attempt to prompt the adopting of more stringent targets in big carbon-emitting countries in advance of the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It coincided with Japan, Canada, the UK and the EU confirming they are to strengthen commitments under the Paris Agreement, though China and India – the third-largest emitter – are sticking with current plans. Mr Biden said no government could address the climate threat on its own, while collaboration would increase international and food security. “The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting,” he added.The US move will take the world closer to the reductions scientists say are necessary to hold global heating within scientifically-advised limits, according to analysis by Climate Action Tracker. To be in line with a 1.5 degree rise, however, the US would need to cut emissions by 57 per cent to 63 per cent below 2005 levels.US climate envoy John Kerry accepted it was not enough, stressing “it’s a beginning heading towards Glasgow”.Pope Francis said the world faced a challenge to care for nature in the post-pandemic era.“We know that one doesn’t come out of a crisis the same way we entered. We come out either better or worse. We need to ensure the environment is cleaner, more pure. It must be preserved.

Every diocese will need to appoint a “racial justice officer” who will report to the “racial justice unit”. It’s all beginning to sound a little creepy and authoritarian.Church of England schools – both primary and secondary – will need to promote “racial justice”. Theological colleges, meanwhile, will have to “ersify” their curricula, as well as the authors of the books they study. They will also need to introduce “black theology” modules, suggesting that even the study of God is not free of identity politics.Hopefully, even the wokest of Anglican won’t be encouraged to reach the ultimate conclusion that God Himself is racist, even if everything and everyone else is. But that’s the direction studying theology through a racial lens points one in.It’s all rather strange. The Church of England may not be the most erse body in the world, but “From Lament to Action” itself details how ethnic minority people make up 15 per cent of those who worship in the Church, which, if anything, is slightly more than the non-white proportion of the total population.Moreover, the Bible itself proclaims that “there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians 3:28).

The plea came after the Department for Education (DfE) confirmed that all remaining students in England will not be allowed to return to in-person lessons on campus until mid-May at the earliest.Most students in England, apart from those on critical courses, were told not to return to campus as part of the lockdown announced in January.It is estimated that around half of university students in England are not eligible to return to campus for in-person teaching until May 17 at the earliest.This year, students have been paying full tuition, despite most having lost key parts of their educational experience and many having been sold a promise of \u0027blended learning\u0027 that has not been delivered, the letter says.Hundreds of thousands of students have been left with no viable route to redress on any meaningful scale, and as far as we can make out the CMA has completely ignored the issue - despite multiple petitions to the Government which have gained hundreds of thousands of signatures.Almost all students have experienced a diminished experience in comparison to that which was originally promised and advertised to them. University students first saw their teaching moved online in the spring term last year when the national lockdown in March was announced.A CMA spokeswoman said: This letter raises some important issues and we are considering the points made by the unions carefully.We are sympathetic to the situation many students find themselves in, but this is a complex area legally and consumer enforcement action may not be the best or quickest solution for students\u0027 problems. The issues caused by lockdown can vary a lot between different cases. We have published our view on refunds, which explains how we think the law applies. We know that this is not straightforward but students can refer to this statement when talking to their accommodation providers or universities. In particular, it\u0027s important to check out how lockdown laws affect the contract, as well as T\u0026ampCs.A Universities UK spokeswoman said: Universities recognise that students have been extremely resilient in the face of disruption this year.Universities and their staff have done all they can to help students progress with their studies and meet their learning outcomes, offering a blended approach to learning wherever possible, however they have had to adapt their provision in line with government restrictions and public health advice.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"veterans deserve better treated political football","story":"On Monday two elderly former soldiers will appear in court accused of murdering IRA leader Joe McCann in Belfast half a century ago. This is the first time British soldiers have been tried for killing a terrorist during the bloody 30 year campaign. The death was investigated at the time by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and judged to be lawful.In 2019 Boris Johnson signed the Veterans Pledge, which included “New legislation to end repeated and vexatious investigations into historical allegations against our servicemen and women — including in Northern Ireland”. This week Conservative MP Johnny Mercer was forced to resign as Veterans Minister, amid his protest that there was no prospect of such legislation under this government.Responding, the prime minister said: “we are committed to doing more over the coming months, including for those who have served in Northern Ireland”. Can we believe this? During the 2019 election campaign he promised to maintain the size of the Army. Last month he announced a cut of 10,000. In 2011 David Cameron declared he would enshrine in law the Armed Forces Covenant — intended to ensure fair treatment for all military personnel, veterans and their families, especially in healthcare, education, housing and employment. Ten years later this had still not been done, although in January, introducing the Armed Forces Bill, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told parliament: “For the first time ever we are putting into law the Armed Forces Covenant”.That is why government ministers have a special responsibility not just to ensure effective defence even when it doesn’t win votes or affect the next news cycle, but also to look after the men and women that serve. Aside from duty of care, morale means everything to fighting troops. As Napoleon famously said: “The moral is to the physical as three is to one”, ie morale is three times as important as everything else combined. In battle, commanders understand how vital it is that soldiers know they will be given immediate treatment if wounded. That extends beyond the battlefield to healthcare and welfare back home and after their service is over.Hence the need for the Military Covenant. And to do everything possible to protect soldiers from predatory lawyers who, for political motives or greed, want to see them behind bars. Brian Wood, a Military Cross winner, was investigated for five years before being cleared of alleged war crimes in Iraq and the solicitor that tormented him was struck off. He was one of hundreds of troops persecuted for their military service in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland. I know how it feels, having been rigorously investigated by the police over a killing in Northern Ireland 12 years after it happened. But I had it easy compared to the untold suffering of many who have been hauled in front of never-ending inquisitions more recently. As Johnny Mercer said in his resignation letter: “veterans are being sectioned, drinking themselves to death and dying well before their time”.The Iraq and Afghanistan investigations — virtually all without foundation — were allowed because the government feared intervention by the International Criminal Court and the politically devastating prospect of British troops being dragged into the dock at The Hague. The hounding of Northern Ireland veterans is permitted to appease republicans who are carrying on the war by political means in order to rewrite history, painting their terrorists as freedom fighters and British troops as crazed killers. Any effective action to prevent it would be strongly contested by the government of the Republic of Ireland.These are not easy situations but neither was soldiering in Northern Ireland, Iraq or Afghanistan. The government has an absolute duty to defend our troops with the strength and courage they themselves summoned up when sent by the government to fight.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits could begin european holidays","story":"NewsBrits could begin European holidays in June as EU prepares to open bordersHopes are rising for holiday abroad as the EU prepares to open up travel to nations with high vaccination rates and vaccine travel certicates - both of which the UK should have from mid-MaymirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsHopes of beach holidays are rising as EU officials prepare to relax restrictions \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Holidaymakers with government-backed vaccine travel certicates, which the Government plans to announce next month, are likely to be exempt from a blanket entry ban. EU officials are planning to update entry recommendations to the bloc meaning travellers from countries with Covid apospassportapos systems and higher vaccination rates could be allowed in. But it would mean younger British adults may need to rush to get their Covid- vaccinationthey want to holiday abroad this summer. More than million people in the UK have had their first dose of a vaccine and more than million have had both. Whitehall sources confirmed the Government is planning to bring in its own Covid travel apospassportapos next month ahead of foreign travel restarting on May . One told the Mirror: aposWeaposre going to give people a document so irrespective of restrictions when they get back to the UK, they have something that carries weight. Officials are working on a digital official certication scheme that Brits can show at foreign borders. They will be subject to a range of restrictions, including testing and quarantine, when theyto the UK depending on the apostraffic-light statusapos of their holiday destination. Separately, the European Commission is planning to roll out a Europe-wide vaccine passport scheme for EU citizens by the end of June. One Brussels source told the Mirror: There is provision to strike deals with countries outside the EU which have their own scheme for vaccination certication.  We need to get Europe up and running as a first priority before opening up to the outside. Thereaposs definitely lots of pressure to do this before the summer so I think itaposs a question of weeks. They added: The discussion is going to sht to people who have had the vaccination, wherever they come from. But some EU officials remain cautious about the risk of new strains entering the bloc, after the so-called aposKent iantapos drove up cases on the Continent. Talks on a deal on Covid travel passports have yet to take place with the EU as whole - with British officials discussing the issue with inidual European capitals instead. Countries that rely on tourists like Spain and Portugal could go it alone - Greece and Cyprus are already operating dferent rules from the rest of the block.  Quarantine rules and testing regimes for holidaymakers will be decided by each member state. Spain’s tourism minister Fernando Valdes today said the country is “desperate to welcome British tourists back this summer. He said officials are encouraged by the speed of the UKaposs vaccination programme and vaccine passports are going to help us. Mr Valdes told Sky News: I think we will be ready here in Spain. We also think that the vaccination scheme in the UK is going pretty well, so hopefully weaposll be seeing this summer the restart of holidays. Under the UK Governmentaposs roadmap, May  is the earliest people can leave the country for foreign holidays. When foreign breaks are allowed, other countries are likely to ask for proof that UK travellers have been vaccinated.  Much-hyped ‘Covid certicates’ for UK domestic use - allowing Brits to show they’ve had either a vaccine, negative test or a previous Covid case to get into gigs and sports matches - are likely to only come later. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: We are working on a solution to enable residents to prove their Covid- status, including vaccination status, to other countries on the outbound leg. We are working on this as a priority and intend to have the solution ready as soon as possible. Hopes are rising that the vaccinated will be able to go on holiday more freely, after a European medical agency recommended fully vaccinated travellers should be able to sidestep tests and quarantine. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said: “Requirements for testing and quarantine of travellers and regular testing at workplaces can be waived or modied for fully vaccinated iniduals.” "},{"url":null,"title":"summer holidays europe could go","story":"NewsSummer holidays to Europe could go ahead from June - all your questions answeredBritish holidaymakers are likely to be exempt from a blanket entry ban to Europe thanks to the UKs successful jabs rolloutmirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsSpain is among the destinations that could welcome Brits this summer \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Which countries can I visit  Itaposs not clear yet but the Government will announce a apostraffic lightapos green list - probably only of  or  countries initially - before May . These are likely to include safe ones where case rates are low and vaccination rates are high, like Iceland, Israel, Gibraltar, the UAE and possibly the United States. They could also reach a deal with the EU based on vaccine certication. So will I need a Covid vaccination certicate to travel  The Government is planning to issue Covid passports - either in paper or digital form - so Brits can prove at foreign borders that they have been vaccinated. This could happen next month. While this wouldnapost change the rules when you get home, it could mean that more countries - and the EU - are prepared to let Brits in because of our high jab and low case rates.

He should instead be promising to cleanse his sleazy Government, but fat chance of that. A leader willing to do favours for pals and Tory donors with his phone number is ruling for personal and party interest. His shameless behaviour comes against the background of his predecessor David Cameron ruthlessly exploiting personal contacts for a firm planning to make the ex-PM even richer.

But the duo say they have been stopped by an eleventh hour letter from the online giantaposs legal team over their logo. It raises concerns that Amazeaposs aposuse of Amazonaposs trademarksapos would aposconfuse consumersapos and insisted the signage must be changed. Mr Lee and Ms Reehal have endured months of gruelling work and setbacks due to the Covid pandemic to get the store ready.Do you have a view on this story  Let us know in the comments below or email webnews@mirror.And they say this latest hurdle is beyond belief - as it has come from the richest man in the world. Mr Lee said: We have been working so hard for months collecting donations from some amazingly generous people and now days before we are due to open the shop Amazon is trying to stop us. The richest man in the world has instructed his lawyers to stop us smiling just days before we open on Saturday - it’s beyond belief. Legal firm Morgan Lewis, which represents Amazon, said it was unable discuss or comment on any legal matters regarding the company. In a letter to Mr Lee, Morgan Lewis said Amazon was concerned that use of its trademarks, in particular the use of the apossmile logoapos, would confuse consumers into believing the shop was connected with or endorsed by Amazon, when this was not the case. The letter asked Mr Lee to adopt a new logo that does not include the apossmile logoapos and is not in any other way similar to Amazon’s trademarks, adding that Amazon had no objection to the use of the name Amaze.  Amazon itself pledged to contact Mr Lee with a view to making a donation and or discussing how it could help further, but added that no statement could be provided due to the legalities of the trademark matter. Mr Lee and Ms Reehal found themselves homeless in the run-up to Christmas . Mr Lee lost everything he owned and had to walk out of his five-bedroom home in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, and they ended up sleeping in his car. After getting back on their feet, with the help of kind strangers who offered them a shed to sleep in, the family have dedicated themselves to helping others facing homelessness. They set up a community interest companycalled Letaposs Make A Change, offering discount voucher schemes and programmes which sponsor homeless people in finding employment. The Worcester Road shopaposs grand opening event on Saturday will still go ahead, but the smile icon will be removed to appease Amazon. There will be live music throughout the day, stilt men, and free ice cream for everybody who visits the shop.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  All money raised at the shop will go to Let’s Make A Change CIC. Ms Reehal said: This is no ordinary charity shop. There are no old clothes, shoes or bedding, only quality furniture, pictures and ornaments together with a large range of home crafted items on sale. Mr Lee added: We were homeless, we lost everything. It’s only when you’ve got personal experience of being homeless that you realise just how bad it is. You realise just how much of a hill you have to climb. People are so generous in dropping a quid in a hat. That helps but it doesn’t build a future. When you’re homeless you need to have a means to get a job and build your confidence. We provide employment for people in need and give them the opportunity to earn a living wage.

After contracting Covid at work, Edel had been seriously ill and off work for six weeks. On a zero-hour contract, her pay had stopped. One of the heroes of the pandemic, she had ended up having to survive on food parcels from a local charity. “I just thought – this is not fair,” Edel says. “I wanted to change things so that all care workers could have a Real Living Wage, and things like sick pay. But also, our dignity.” What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Just before the pandemic hit, Edel had become involved with Citizens Cymru Wales’ campaign for a Real Living Wage for care workers. But now, during Covid, it was dficult to organise people. “I thought, I know where care workers will be,” she says. “They were some of the only people going to work at that time. The early morning bus stops were full of them. “Others were just walking to work in the rain because they couldn’t afford the bus fare. I was walking to work to save money for rent, so I chatted to them while I was walking. “They would tell me: ‘At my place of work, everyone is dying’. One woman told me she and her husband were both care workers and couldn’t work because of Covid-. “Her son, who had cancer, had taken his own le because he was so worried about being a burden to them. These were terrible stories. Coming from Africa, these stories of poverty shocked me.”  Edel gradually gathered names for a petition, organised school workshops, led summits, and met First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford. “I asked him ‘how can we care for the vulnerable when we are not able to take care of ourselves ’,” Edel says. “I’d just come from a -hour nightsht, I was tired, I told him, this is very unfair, the way careworkers are treated. “It’s not just the money. It’s the way people put you down. “Careworkers need to be uplted to feel like we are human beings. In the next few years, we will all need careworkers. Do you want someone looking after you who is thinking ‘how am I going to feed my kids’ ” She laughs drily. “I know that when I care for people, I can put a smile on their face. But a smile on their face won’t pay my bills.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Originally from Kenya, Edel came to the UK to study at Cardf University. She became a care worker to support herself. “When I caught Covid at work, I was so ill, I didn’t have enough breath to speak,” she says. “I looked like someone in the grave. I spoke to my work to say I have no money. They told me: ‘you have to come back to workyou want to be paid’. I went in and they took one look at me – ‘Just go home!’ they said. “I was looking like death itself. So, again I couldn’t work. My friend signed me up for charity food. I wasn’t happy with her, but I started eating again. Now, I think it was the best thing she could have done.” Edel’s dogged campaigning alongside other Citizens leaders has won manesto commitments from all the major parties fighting the election in Wales in two weeks’ time. Welsh Labour has pledged to introduce the Real Living Wage for people working in social care in Walesthey win. Plaid Cymru has committed to a minimum £ wage for care workers, and the Conservative Party has pledged a “Welsh Minimum Care Wage of £ per hour”. As she speaks to me, her attempts to influence politics by campaigning in bus stops sit in stark contrast to the lobbying scandal in Downing Street. Community organising is the moral opposite of lobbying, special favours, elite networking and paid access to politicians. It’s the work of bringing people together to take action around common concerns to overcome social injustice. A model used by all kinds of grassroots groups who want to make society fairer – and it’s at the heart of Citizens UK. “Edel has been a leading voice in negotiations on behalf of care workers – demanding not just warm words, but action to increase their wages,” says Fiona Meldrum, community organiser at Citizens Cymru Wales.

When his coffin went past my hidey-hole and into the chapel — my last sight of the man I photographed for  years — I was overwhelmed with memories of an incredible man. From the most unusual vantage point of my years photographing the royals, I was close enough to see Prince Charles look broken. Close to tears, I could see he realised the weight of the task ahead to look after his mother and the monarchy.  Mr Edwards also took a dramatic picture of a member of The Rles collapsing outside St Georgeaposs Chapel. Prince Philip spent more than a decade planning his funeral, designing his Land Rover hearse over a -year period. The vehicle featured an open top rear with special aposstopsapos to secure the Dukeaposs coffin in place.

But due it to being dark in her room, she picked up a small white nail glue bottle, instead which she also had in her bag, WXYZ reports. Yacedrah, from Michigan, US, whose husband Derrick was asleep next to her, said: ‘I was like, “Oh my goodness”. It dropped in my eye, and I tried to wipe it away. It sealed my eye shut’.  ‘I just started throwing cold water, and I was trying to pull my eyes apart but couldn’t. aposI was just screaming for him to call ’. Derrick woke up when he heard her screams and rushed her to a hospital.  Fortunately, doctors were able to open Yacedrah’s eyes and removed her contact lens, which ended up being a blessing. She said: ‘They said that contacts saved my vision’. ‘They kept saying, you’ll probably lose your lashes, which I did, because they had to pull on it and flip the top of my lid’.

For some, that may mean applying a sultry smokey eye, and for others, a bright bold lipstick.However, safety measures are still in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus, which means it is still compulsory to wear our masks.Whilst youaposre able to go mask-free when sitting at the table, you must still wear them when you go inside to use the bathroom or to walk around the venue. But wearing a mask shouldnapost deter you from liberally applying your favourite lipstick.So, we spoke to Saffron Hughes, makeup artist at FalseEyelashes, to find out how we can stop that lippy from budging.After applying your lipstick, Saffron says you should slowly buff your lips with your finger, as she says: This will create a thinner layer of lipstick which will keep any excess formula rubbing off onto your mask. Then, lightly move your finger in a circular motion straight after application and wait five minutes before dusting on powder to set the colour in place. Ensure to do this gently as you don’t wait to eradicate all the colour, she warned, adding, just enough so the right amount of product is absorbed into the lips and excess has been removed. Another option is to wear your lipstick as a stain, which is an efficient way to sustain colour with no residue.

After his car was written off in a crash, the man has been getting the bus to and from work while he waits for the insurance to pay out to buy a new one. He says his job involves him being on his feet for the entirety of his -hour shts and that he genuinely cherishes the time sitting down on the bus ride home knowing he still has a  minute walk home from the bus stop which means more time on my feet. But his actions on one journey home infuriated fellow passengers, his family, and people on the internet after he defended his decision not to give up his seat to a pregnant passenger.

Then he blinked in disbelief as through his binoculars he saw a naked teenage boy, with shoulder- hair, darting along the clfside. Next he and other boys had jumped into the water and were swimming in his direction, screaming at the top of their lungs. “My name is Stephen,” the first boy said in perfect English as he reached Peter’s boat. “There are six of us and we reckon we’ve been here  months.” Peter was already a well-known figure in his home country, the youngest son of one Australia’s richest men who, aged , had spurned his chance to take over his father’s electronics company and ran away to sea in search of adventure. Over the next few years he became an accomplished and celebrated sailor, winning the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race three times in the s, although he did eventually reluctantly join his father’s firm. But it was his encounter on September ,  with a group of marooned boys as he breezed past ‘Ata, a minuscule but paradisiacal island at the far end of the Tonga archipelago, which would earn him worldwide fame. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Unbeknown to Peter, he had come across a group of shipwrecked public school boys who had been marooned on the remote island for  months, and who had been given up for dead by their families who had even held funerals for all of them. The incredible story, which was compared to the William Golding’s  novel Lord of the Flies, has been remembered again after Peter, still sailing aged , died earlier this month when his yacht capsized off Australia’s New South Wales coast. Tides at the notoriously dangerous Ballina Bar threw him overboard and although a fellow sailor dragged his body to shore, paramedics weren’t able to revive him. Speaking of the moment he first saw the six teenage castaways, Peter remembered: “The first figure was swimming towards me doing the Australian crawl, as I call it. “And then another five bodies leapt off the clf and into the water and followed him.” Peter knew that ‘Ata hadn’t been inhabited since , when a slave ship had arrived and kidnapped the natives, taking them to Peru and leaving the island cursed and deserted ever since.  At first wary of the boys’ claims, the skipper radioed Tonga’s capital, Nuku’alofa, to very the story. “The operator very tearfully said, ‘it’s true’,” Peter later recalled. “‘These boys were students. They’ve been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. And now you’ve found them’. “It was a very emotional moment for all of us.” As more details emerged of how the boys - Sione, Stephen, Kolo, David, Luke and Mano - had found themselves shipwrecked, and how they had survived for so long on their own, the more incredible the story became. Sick of school meals and bored of le at their strict Catholic boarding school in Nuku’alofa, the boys - aged between  and  - decided to ‘borrow’ a boat from a local fisherman and try to escape to Fiji, some  miles away. Taking with them two sacks of bananas, a few coconuts and a small gas burner, they sailed out of the harbour.  Mano Totau later explained the boys’ desire to leave their boarding school: “We were not happy where we were. If you were in a place, you don’t know where it is, and also you did not see any part of your family, I don’t think you’d be happy to be there… you won’t be happy until you see your family.” But that night, after all the boys had fallen asleep, a huge storm ripped the boat from its anchor, tearing off the sail and rudder and leaving the vessel drting directionless on the open ocean. Sione Fataua recalled how they were sure they would die. “No food, no water. We were just drting around by the wind. And after eight days we saw the island.” The boys had drted more than  miles off course and landed on the uninhabited island of ‘Ata. The boat ended up crashing into the rocky shore and shattering as the boys scrambled to safety on land. Mano remembered: “When I reach the shore, I tried to stand up but when I stand up the whole world is spinning, so I laid down and crawl ashore and when I touch the grass, then I lie down.  “We were very happy, but the first thing we did, we say a prayer, thank God for what he brought us to.” Desperate to quench their thirst, they then hunted sea bird, drank their blood and drained their eggs. “After that, we all fell down there and sleep until the sunrise the next morning woke us up.” What happened next was very dferent to the Lord of the Flies story, in which the British schoolboys stranded on a deserted Pacic island proved incapable of governing themselves. In the real le survival story the teenage castaways organised themselves into teams of two, drawing up a strict roster for garden, kitchen and garden duty, and after managing to light a fire tended the flame so it never went out. They survived at first on fish, coconuts and birds, but later found an ancient volcanic crater where they discovered wild taro, bananas and chickens, which had been reproducing since the last Tongans had left.  When one boy fell off a clf and broke his leg, the others set his leg using sticks and leaves until it had completely healed. One of the boys, Kolo, even made a makesht guitar from a piece of drtwood, half a cocoanut shell and six steel wires salvaged from their wrecked boat - an instrument Peter kept for the rest of his le. Peter wrote in his memoirs how the boys “had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old kne blade and much determination.” Of the moment he finally stepped aboard Peter’s yacht, Manu said: “I could not explain how we feel, all of us, we are full of tears, happy, and like we walk through to heaven.” But their adventure didn’t end there. On theirto Nuku’alofa the boys were imprisoned after the owner of the boat they had taken decided to press charges.

Peter was eventually able to secure their release from jail by selling the Australian film rights to their story and using the money to pay for a replacement boat. The boys then ed to ‘Ata to reenact their time there for the Channel Seven documentary. When the boys were finally ed home the sailor was proclaimed a national hero. Peter remembers arriving at the little island of Ha’afeva where most of the boys were from: “The whole population of this little island were on the beach, hugging the boys. Parents were crying. Then the party started. Six days of feasting.” Sione remembered the moment he was reunited with his family. “My mum, she was swimming out before I get out the boat. I’m the first one going to the beach, and give me a hug.” Peter was also invited to an audience with Tonga’s King Taufa‘ahau Tupou IV, a meeting which meant his lelong wish to turn his back on his father’s electronics firm and live his le on the sea finally came true. After the king granted Peter’s request to trap lobster in Tonga’s waters and start a business there, he resigned from the company, commissioned a new ship then hired the boys he had rescued as the crew of his new fishing boat.

I’m ready to go,” he said.“It doesn’t matter how fit and ready, though # I have no given right to play in this team every week.“The illness was a setback for me, obviously, and the team played well when I was ill.“Coming back into the team, with  minutes on Tuesday, with performances like that, you just have to put it into the manager’s mind for the next game.“That’s all I try to do.”Though he wanted desperately to be back out on the pitch helping his side, Adam was determined to continue setting the standards as club captain, substitute or not.And he hopes he’s done enough to lead out the side at Dens on Saturday.He added: “It is always tough sitting on the side. I’m not any dferent from anyone . At my age, I want to play, but that#s football.“The manager makes that decision and you respect it.“I’ve always believed that, when you get an opportunity, you have to show the right attitude and mentality.“I hope that  minutes against Inverness gives him that headache for the weekend.“It’s easy to sulk, easy to just sit there, but as an experienced player, it is important I show the demands, set the standards.“I have to set the right example for the football club.“I want to win football games, get into the play-offs, finish second.“And I do believe we have the team that’s good enough to get through these play-offs and play one of the Premiership teams.”On recovering from coronavirus, Adam revealed how far it set him back.Manager James McPake said at the start of the month: “Covid knocked him for six a wee bit and it took him a while to get himself back into what he felt was the level he should bring, even in training.”And Adam says it’s only now he is starting to feel back to his best.“It was tough # I had four or five tough days with Covid,” Adam said.“Two weeks after it, I came on against Arbroath and felt terrible. Even in training I never felt great.“But over the last week,  days, two weeks, I’ve started to feel good, getting minutes here and there.“When the team’s playing well it is dficult to get in and you just have to wait for your opportunity.“Hopefully Inverness it gives the manager a thought.“I feel good and ready # and at my age, that little break maybe helped!“The play-off games are going to come thick and fast and I’m looking forward to it.”Dundee missed the chance to secure that play-off place as they drew - with nine-man Inverness on Tuesday night.Despite a positive second half display which saw the Dark Blues dominate, they were held to a third consecutive draw in the league.And that has left them four points behind Saturday’s opponents Raith, meaning they need victory at Dens and then a favour from Hearts combined with a win at Queen of the South to grab second spot.Post-match talk in the Highlands centred on the referee’s performance with a controversially disallowed Jason Cummings opener a contentious point for the Dark Blues.“It is the second time we’ve been here in Inverness where a decision has cost us three points,” Adam said.“It wasn’t offside # it’s a goal.“In the second half we dominated the match, even against  men.“We switch off when they’re down to nine men and they score the goal. We bounced back in the right way and managed to get the equaliser, but the offside decision was a huge blow.“But in this situation we have to dust ourselves down and go again.“There are two games to go and it’s an opportunity to climb into the play-offs.“We’re a point closer and we need to produce two big performances in the next two weeks, really.”He added: “It sets us up for a huge game on Saturday against Raith Rovers.“We have to do our business and win two football matches, then we’ll sit down and see where we are.“The form is good # we’re unbeaten in six # and we just have to concentrate on ourselves.“We know that on our day we can hurt teams in this league.“There’s no medals given at this moment in time.” Dundee #robbed# of opening goal Inverness red a #shocking decision#

when you have the madness of the Scottish Championship to contend with This is football, indeed.It was a madcap night of fitba up in the Highlands last night with two red cards, disallowed goals, two actual goals that counted and two managers very unhappy with one referee.What more do you want Well, Dundee certainly want a bit more.And, forget the whole conceding-against-nine-men thing, they should have been enjoying a first-ever league win at Inverness Caledonian Thistle.Because even against  opponents, the Dark Blues were bossing the contest in the second half.A major part of that was the introduction of Charlie Adam at the break.Dundee weren’t miles behind Caley in the first half but never really got hold of the ball in midfield.That all changed with the talisman in there.And he looked like a man determined to prove a point.Covid hit and while Adam was out, Dundee found some form and a formation that worked.When he ed, however, fitting the former Scotland man into the set-up proved dficult.What do you do, change a successful set-up to get your best player into the team Or make the tough call to leave him on the bench and stick with what’s working And it was working, up until the first half last night.Dundee had won three and drawn twice playing with two in the middle of the park.However, they needed three after a poor first half and manager James McPake must have been delighted to see the improvement in his side in the second .Because they were the better team – once more it was finding that killer edge that was missing.Then their hosts being reduced to nine men made Dundee overwhelming favourites to take the points.And it looked like they had done just that with Jason Cummings heading in, only for a belated offside call.But they were caught napping at the other end.It was remarkable and so very Dundee to see a team with nine men get in behind and open the scoring.It could have been a real embarrassment, losing to nine men.But they dug themselves out of the hole, with Lee Ashcroft once more the man to step up when needed.And what a fine header it was, too.I’m determined not to focus too much on conceding to nine men, though.Because the overall performance in the second half was a very positive one – one that should give hope for the upcoming play-offs –they finally secure that.Six unbeaten with Adam looking in mean form, the Dark Blues should be looking forward to taking on the play-offs.But it is Dundee, there will no doubt be more madness to come.Who needs a Super League when you have this Not often will I shake up the order of this column.Not often will I record Monday Night Football and watch the preview while the live match is actually being played.However, this European Super League nonsense is shaking everything up this week.I’ve no doubt the Bond-villain types who came up with this scheme via Zoom calls from their carved-out volcano islands expected a bit of a reaction.I can’t think they expected to unite the entire footballing world against them, though.As we’ve seen all too often in our game, clubs just seem to enjoy quarrelling with each other – often to the detriment of the game as a whole.Now, though, the “founding members” of the newly-announced European Super League have done what few have done before – got everybody in the game on the same page.I have to admit it was dficult to keep my eye on the ball at Inverness last night while the fun and games were going on.Teams pulling out, people resigning and all sorts of crazy going on.Proper soap opera stuff.And all this couldn’t have happened to a better bunch of blokes, to be honest.What might happen now, though, is after this fright – and hopefully the ESL is dead – people might actually sort out the problems that led to its formation in the first place.It’s a big game for Kilmarnock in the Premiership tonight – not so much for Dundee United.My guess is they’d quite like to get this one out of the way so they can concentrate on the big cup clash this weekend up at Aberdeen.However, keeping up their recent form wouldn’t be such a bad warm-up.Very quietly the Tangerines have racked up four wins on the spin and only conceded once in five matches.One defeat – to champions Rangers – in their last nine.Very, very decent from Micky Mellon’s men. Dundee #robbed# of opening goal Inverness red a #shocking decision# # Managers James

at two Aberdeen sheltered housing complexes in a bid to “reverse the physical decline” caused by lockdown.With many people staying home whenever possible over the last year, opportunities for leaving the house and being active have been limited.As a result of the increased inactivity, health bosses have noticed people getting weaker and more injury-prone.Next month Bon Accord Careis going to trial a new scheme to help residents at two sheltered housing complexes regain some of the strength lost to lockdown.From May , specially-developed packs will be delivered to Provost Hogg Court and Fairley Den in Aberdeen as part of BAC’s Staying Active And Moving More initiative.Each contains image cards of exercise which residents can safely carry out at home, alongside basic equipment such as resistance bands.The project will initially run for  weeks, with the option to make it a permanent fixture across all BAC sitesit is deemed a success.It was drawn up by Catriona Binns and Dawn Walker from Bon Accord Care, with Andrinne Craig from Sport Aberdeen and members of Aberdeen City Health And Social Care Partnership.Ms Walker, a BAC reablement facilitator, said: “This is a really exciting project for Bon Accord Care to be involved with.“Both Catriona and I are delighted to have the opportunity to become involved with this initiative in an effort to reverse the physical decline and deconditioning that has occurred within our service users during lockdown.“We look forward to seeing the positive results and the effect on our service users’ physical and mental wellbeing.”Darren Smith, Aberdeen City Health And Social Care Partnership wellbeing coordinator, said: “The recent lockdowns have seriously de-conditioned our citizens, especially older adults.“These physical activity packs were specically designed to redress this de-conditioning.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range as well as the percentage of that population covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses.  The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all. Find out more at the www.wwf.org.uk website.I look forward to seeing the things you believe will make Scotland a better place, perhaps changing the way we heat our homes, how we travel around our towns and cities, or even how we grow the food we eat.Lang Banks, director, WWF Scotland, EdinburghSir,Tuesday March  marked the anniversary of the day the UK entered lockdown. We have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust, like everyone , to the daily challenges this  has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we’re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares. We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.Let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind PeopleScotland, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures march 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

When we hear of something that is dficult to believe, we want the evidence of our own eyes.Jesus#s disciple Thomas was like that. It was the week after the crucixion had destroyed their dreams. The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream continues for bob","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are plenty online groups and pages offering guidance and support. DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Chris Muldoon, operations officer, Dogs for Good.Sir,The tables for Dementia UK’s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been completely reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity’s annual fundraising event takes place from May  to .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities. One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"a wreath in memory of the duke of edinburgh","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Problems have remained since they re-opened.Landowners and farmers remain plagued by fly-tippers. Throughout the pandemic picturesque sights across Scotland have been routinely spoiled by the unwelcome sight of garden and other waste.SLE chief executive Sarah-Jane Laing said: #Ending the scourge of fly-tipping and healing our rural communities is at the heart of SLE’s priorities for the next parliament. In our manesto we call on all parties to commit to prevent, detect and prosecute fly-tipping offences, with tough sentences for repeat offenders.#Fly-tipping has serious social, environmental and health implications. It poses a threat to people and wildle, damages our environment and spoils people#s enjoyment of the outdoors.#It is more than an eyesore # it is dangerous, and it is a crime. Too many landowners and farmers find themselves in a vicious cycle of costly clean-ups. Forced, as victims, to not only have to remove potentially hazardous materials, but also to bear the financial burden of waste crime. Rural businesses can find themselves liable for bills of thousands of pounds to clean up land that has been fly-tipped, with many offered no support from their local authority.#We are pleased that, after representation from SLE and others, the Scottish Government agreed to give equal weight to fly-tipping in its forthcoming litter strategy.#We will work with the next government and all parties to protect our rural communities from fly-tipping with tough measures and comprehensive cover, to ensure victims of fly-tipping are no longer out of pocket to clear it up.#"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead competitions galore","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

what now WeaskedDr Georgia Perona-Wright, who is a senior lecturer in Immunology at the University of Glasgow, to weigh in.Can I still get Covid, after Irsquom vaccinated Yes, you can. The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likelythat you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protectionit is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Can I still infect other people Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect othersthan people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their ownthey need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.Can I stop wearing a facemask when Irsquom vaccinated No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optionalin more places.Will immunity last We are optimisticthat immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twisthere, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellipWill I need a booster ... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one is immunity doesnrsquot last long enoughwithout a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one is the virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.Will everything go back to normal once everyone has had both doses The gradual easing of restrictionsthat have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travelmight need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-tests-people-without-symptoms","story":"CORONAVIRUS tests for people without symptoms are being offered in Peeblesshire again from today.In a press release issued by NHS Borders last week, the health board outlined plans for rapid testing sites toacross the region.Tests will be offered in West Lintontodayand tomorrow.COVIDtesting will alsoin Peeblesand Innerleithenover the weekend.:Fire started deliberately in Peeblesshire, suspect police ndash appeal issuedTesting will take place at the fire stations of all the above locations between .am-pm.NHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoCommunity testing of those who feel well and do not have any typical COVID- symptoms is one of the key ways that we can keep each other safe.

Some indication of Scott Parkrsquos status within the current and proposed Development Plans would also have aided transparency.ldquoNowhere do I see any attempt to reuse any of the existing buildings, which you might think might be a compelling reason in sustainability terms to examine this site rather more closely in the initial site search.ldquoAnd without a detailed brief being indicated, not only is it dficult to look at the fit and design options of the ious sites, but also it is unclear as to the centralisation of community facilities proposed here.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe council has made use of an online digital exercise supplemented with an unmanned exhibition in the Galashiels Transport Interchange to provide a robust consultation.ldquoWe would like to place on record our thanks to all of the people that have taken the time to submit comments on the proposals since the consultation went live on March .Anyone interested in making a comment can do so through the link on the councilrsquos website or directly to Galacampus@scotborders.gov.ukldquoFollowing the closure of this initial phase of the consultation, the feedback will be reflected upon and used to help prepare a report to the council in late spring recommending the next steps for the project.The full letter from Charles StrangI write on behalf of Scottish Borders Greens to draw your readersrsquo attention to the imminent closing date for submissions on the proposals for the ldquonew Gala Academy.Comments are due in on or before Monday  April. It has been suggested where, and in the columns of local newspapers, that this consultation is a sham.Why is it important that readers take the time and make the effort to respond to this consultation  It is not because the consultation itself has great merit.The Council itself has taken planning advice from consultants which tells them effectively that they need pay no attention to the results of any consultation.It may be that they have sought this independent advice because their own planners have maintained their professional judgements that the proposed site, given in perpetuity to the people of Galashiels as a ldquopleasure ground, is a key green space which should continue to be maintained as such.That is how they have described it in the recent consultative draft Local Development Plan, and no doubt in Development Plans before that.The Council appears reluctant to share their brief for this major improvement in secondary school provision for the Galashiels catchment area.It seems unlikely that, as has been suggested, there is no brief for this multi million pound expenditure: some form of brief would be essential to assess even one single option, never mind a range.Another useful role for any brief would be to examine the potential for retention of any of the educational facilities which already comprise the secondary school campus. This is a particularly important aspect when one considers the amount of embodied energy present in the existing buildings on the site. Plainly when one is addressing the sustainability of any development the existing buildings and site characteristics are critical factors.No, on the face of it this is not a genuine consultation, but a hollow exercise seeking to justy an Education Authority taking the easy option of expanding onto a greenfield site just because they think they can.The people who care about public open space, and trust in local government, should still be seeking to make their voices heard."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-sees-no-cases-recorded-last-24-hours","story":"NO cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the last  hours.The Scottish Government released the latest data at pm today .There have now been , cases of COVID-in the region since the start of the pandemic ndash an increase of one over the weekend.Nationally, , positive cases have been recorded since March last year.According to the most recent data, there are still fewer than five people in hospital in the Borders with the virus.This has been the case every day through March and April, .You might also be interested in:Borders could get pound.m boost from major eventset for region, says councilBorders considers hiring empty homes officerto bring end to vacant propertiesMan assaulted partner and then gave abuse to nursesat Borders General Hospital"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-parliament-election-borders-candidates-hustings","story":"IN the lead-up to next monthrsquos Scottish Parliament elections, three hustings relevant to Borders voters will be held in the coming days.Tomorrowat .pm a virtual hustings over Zoom will be hosted by Borders environmental group Tweedgreen and Tweeddale Peace Group.This meeting will cover the constituency of Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale.All constituency candidates have been invited, with organisers saying questions will ldquofocus on the climate, peace and justice ndash all fundamental issues that are interlinked with the climate crisis, the COVID pandemic, and a green and just recovery from their effects.On Thursday eveningthe Liberal Democratsrsquo candidate for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, Catriona Bhatia, will participate in a National Farmers Unionhustings at pm .A spokesperson for the NFU said: ldquoThis webinar will give members the opportunity to hear from and question the lead rural affairs candidates from each of the five main parties.And on April  there will be a West Linton event held over Zoom between .pm-pm.The third Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale hustings will welcome candidates from the five main parties represented at this yearrsquos election ndash more candidates could be added before the event.To join tomorrows Tweedgreen event and submit questions, email: tweedgreenpeebles@googlemail visit the NFU Scotland Facebook page to access the Zoom link for Thursdayrsquos hustings and to join the West Linton meeting, register at: tinyurl wlhustings and send questions to westlintonhustings@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"broughton-john-buchan-way-trees-plan-opposed-campaigners","story":"PROPOSALS to plant trees in a National Scenic Areain the Borders have been met with opposition from locals.The plans for Peeblesshires John Buchan Way involve afforestation across  hectares, mainly for commercial purposes to produce timber, while native broadleaves will also be planted.The new woodland creation would be set ldquowithin the property at Broughton Hope and would see trees planted in one of the Borders two National Scenic Areas.With the consultation process having started, Broughton Community Council was contacted by RDS Forestry, leading to opposition from the community.Fiona Pagett, who has lived in Broughton for  years, has set up a Facebook group called lsquoSave our Glen - JBWrsquo which now has more than  members.:Outcry over bizarre plans to demolish historic mansion near the BordersldquoIrsquom incredibly heartened, though not remotely surprised, at the immediate and enormous opposition to the planting proposal at Broughton Hope, said Ms Pagett, an estate agent.ldquoWe are becoming engulfed in Sitka spruce plantations as the Scottish Government ploughs towards its spurious target of mass planting in the belief this will solve climate change.ldquoIt is disregarding our treasured and erse landscape and threatening much flora and fauna, added Ms Pagett, who lives in the village with her son Angus and daughter Katie.ldquoI have high hopes that this particular proposal, which affects the John Buchan Way, local residents, the shepherd and would negatively impact tourism, will gain the attention of those able to stop it in its tracks.According to Ms Pagett, -year-old shepherd Geordie Wilsonrsquos role ldquowill be removedthe proposals on the land go ahead.

In this instalment ndash the last of the series ndash we speak to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP.Q. What is your party planning to do in the Borders A. Obviously for the Borders, as with the whole of the country, recovery from COVID is a top priority.To get the economy growing again, to support retail, to support tourism.Central to that, of course, will be infrastructure.The SNP has already delivered a signicant infrastructure project, which is very important to the Borders, in terms of the railway.Our manesto will set out plans to build on that and to go further. But to get the economy of the Borders up and running again, and to support growth and the overall wellbeing of people living in the Borders, will be a top priority.Q. Like many local authorities, Scottish Borders Council has declared a climate emergency. What is your party doing on that front A. I think the Scottish Government led the way in declaring a climate emergency.The Scottish Parliament in the last term of parliament has passed what, by any standards, are considered to be world-leading targets to become a net zero emissions country by . And to achieve by  a  per cent reduction in emissions.That puts us right at the leading edge of ambition in terms of ending our contribution to climate change. Setting the targets is the easy bit.Delivering that is, obviously, much more challenging. At the end of last year we published an updated climate change plan including about  dferent policies across how we heat our homes, how we travel around, agriculture, reducing emissions in industry, that will be necessary to meet those targets.Government has a leadership role to play, but to succeed we have to work in partnership with local authorities and, indeed, with the private sector.Obviously, hosting the COP  in Glasgow later this year will be a real catalyst, I think, for the Scottish Government and everybody in Scotland to showcase our ambition, but also to showcase what we are doing and encourage the rest of the world to join with us.Q. You have said that you would like an independent Scotland to join the EU. Would that mean a potentially damaging hard border between Scotland and the rest of the UK A. I donrsquot want a border. I have never wanted a border. I donrsquot want a hard border in future.In terms of the free movement of people, an independent Scotland would continue to be in the common travel area.So there would be no hard border in terms of people.Obviously, in terms of goods and services, our priority would be to keep trade flowing.It is Brexit that has created the issues of borders and many of our exports right now are facing real dficulty and losing a lot of business and a lot of money because of the border dficulties from the UK to the rest of Europe.Independence gives us the opportunity to become part of the European single market again ndash seven times the size of the UK market ndash but to continue to work with the UK and EU to keep trade flowing in both directions between Scotland and England.Q. What would you say your biggest goal was in an independent Scotland A. My biggest goal right now and in an independent Scotland is to make Scotland the best place in the world to grow up.Make it a great country for children to learn in, to grow up in, to make sure we can eradicate child poverty and for Scotland to be a confident, prosperous, fair and equal country.We know that is possible becausewe look across Europe right now at countries very similar in size to Scotland, but often without the vast natural resources that Scotland has, these are countries that are amongst the wealthiest, the fairest and the happiest countries in the world.If places like Norway and Denmark can do that, there is absolutely no reason why Scotland canrsquot as well.Q. Why do you think Scotland voted lsquonorsquo in  A. There is no doubt a iety of reasons.Scotland came closer to voting lsquoyesrsquo than many people would ever have predicted.For people like me, we have to continue to build support, trust and confidence and persuade people. In ,  per cent of people voted lsquoyesrsquo. Most opinion polls right now, including one just published in the last hour [the Border spoke to Ms Sturgeon on April ], show that independence is now supported by a majority of people in Scotland. So already we have moved on signicantly from .Once the COVID pandemic is over, I think people in Scotland should have the right to consider that again and make their choice.Readersrsquo questionsQ. Scotlandrsquos PISAresults in science and maths have dropped under SNP governments. Why has education got worse under the SNP A. We look at the data for exam results in Scotland, we see both attainment rising and the attainment gap closing.We have still got more work to do.That is why we are investing heavily in education and in education recovery, in more teachers.We have invested, over the last parliament, three quarters of a billion pounds specically closing the attainment gap.When we publish our manesto next week, we will set out our plans for the next parliament. Scottish education is high quality.There is work to do to make sure it continues to improve and that we close the poverty-related attainment gap. Part, of course, closing the poverty-related attainment gap is not just focusing on attainment in schools, but focusing on poverty.And we have already taken more action than any previous government in Scotland ndash establishing the Scottish Child Payment, for example, and wersquove put forward plans in this election to double that in the next parliament.A key part in raising educational attainment is to lt children out of poverty.Q. Would there be an Indyref ,you were to lose a second independence referendum A. I donrsquot intend for that to be the situation, so it is a completely hypothetical question."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-issues-statement-time-great-sadness-birthday","story":"The Queen has sent a

researchers have suggested.Educationalists from Cambridge University and Edinburgh University say children would benefit from science and the arts being taught together instead of in subject silos.They say this could be done around themes such as climate change or food security.The model draws inspiration from Renaissance polymaths like Da Vinci, who worked across disciplinary boundaries in pursuit of deeper knowledge.An academic paper, published in the journal Curriculum Perspectives, cites a case study at an Aberdeen primary school, where children showed a deeper understanding of food security and environmental protection issues after learning to grow food in their school grounds.Pam Burnard, professor of arts, creativities and education at the University of Cambridge, said: ldquoIf we look at the amazing designs that Da Vinci produced, itrsquos clear he was combining dferent disciplines to advance knowledge and solve problems.ldquoWe need to encourage children to think in a similar way because tomorrowrsquos adults will have to problem-solve dferently due to the existential crises they will face: especially those of climate, sustainability, and the precarity of le on Earth.Dr Laura Colucci-Gray, of the University of Edinburghrsquos School of Education and Sport, said: ldquoThe nature of these problems calls for a radically dferent approach to knowledge.ldquoWe are proposing a move from the idea of a curriculum as something children are just lsquogivenrsquo to a curriculum lsquoin-the-makingrsquo, in response to transformations that will define their lives.In their alternative model, researchers suggest giving schools greater freedom to determine how to meet general study targets set by the curriculum.Teachers and leadership teams would make collective decisions and share practices about how to engage pupils with unying, cross-curricular themes, such as environmental sustainability.Any attempt to reimagine education along transdisciplinary lines, with subjects being taught together, would require childrenrsquos attainment to be measured dferently, the researchers noted.Prof Burnard said: ldquoIt would require a system of testing which measures how children are internalising ideas and what they are expressing ndash not just what they know.ldquoThat may be an uncomfortable idea for some, but it is the sort of radical

claiming Mr Cummings is ldquobitter following his exit from Downing Street last year.But to his admirers, Mr Cummings is the maverick genius who overturned conventional wisdom to deliver one of the biggest political shocks in decades in the Brexit referendum.He then spent  turbulent months as the power behind the throne in No  before falling from favour.vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings explaining his trip to County Durham during an extraordinary press conference Even after leaving Downing Street last year, following a power struggle involving the Prime Ministerrsquos fiancee Carrie Symonds, Mr Cummings continued to leave no doubt about his open hostility to parts of the British political system.Appearing before MPs in March he claimed the Department of Health and Social Care was reduced to a ldquosmoking ruin when the coronavirus pandemic hit.And he told MPs: ldquoAs the country emerges from lockdown there should be an urgent, very, very hard look by this buildingat what went wrong and why in .One of the key lessons to come out of the crisis was the need to go to ldquoextreme s to try to de-bureaucratise the normal system ndash a key theme in his political philosophy.It was the coronavirus crisis that thrust the man who spent most of his career operating behind the scenes into the spotlight, through his infamous trip to Barnard Castle in apparent breach of lockdown rules.The visit, and his claim he simply wanted to test his eyesight after recovering from coronavirus, attracted such attention that police complained it was undermining their efforts to enforce the regulations.vw,vw,px, px\"Barnard Castle, County Durham, the scene of Mr Cummingsrsquo notorious day trip But Mr Cummings was no stranger to controversy before his ill-fated drive in County Durham.As a special adviser to Michael Gove in the coalition government, his propensity for engaging in political scraps, particularly with the Toriesrsquo Liberal Democrat partners, caused David Cameron to describe him as a ldquocareer psychopath and seek to bar him from Whitehall.He was however to emerge as the former prime ministerrsquos nemesis in the Brexit referendum of , when he was appointed director of the official Vote Leave campaign.It was a role later portrayed in Channel  drama Brexit: The Uncivil War, in which he was played by Benedict Cumberbatch.From the off his tactics were controversial. He ordered the campaign bus to be emblazoned with the disputed claim that leaving the EU would save pound million a week to spend on the NHS.Critics complained that the figure failed to take into account the funding the UK received back from Brussels, but Mr Cummings was only too well aware that the controversy simply served to highlight the sums Britain was sending the EU.vw,vw,px, px\"Benedict Cumberbatch played Dominic Cummings in a Channel  drama about Brexit He was credited with devising the ldquoTake back control slogan which was seen to capture the mood of disillusionment which helped drive the Brexit vote.And he was responsible also for a final online advertising blitz highlighting a potential influx of immigrants from TurkeyBritain remained in the EU, even though there was no imminent prospect of the country joining the bloc.He later wrote thatMr Gove and Boris Johnson, who were fronting the campaign, had not ldquopicked up the baseball bat marked lsquoTurkey NHS pound millionrsquo with five weeks to go the result could have gone the other way.Through it all, Mr Cummings made no secret of his contempt for the senior Tories on the Vote Leave board, complaining they would prefer to spend weekends off with their girlfriends than the hard business of campaigning.There was therefore consternation among many at Westminster when Mr Johnson became prime minister in July  and chose Mr Cummings to head up his No  operation.Whitehall was given an early taste of how he would operate when he fired Sonia Khan, a special adviser to then chancellor Sajid Javid, and had her marched out of Downing Street by an armed police officer for alleged leaks.vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings in Downing Street With Parliament deadlocked over Brexit, he was seen as the author of the plan to prorogue its sittings, subsequently ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, and the purge of the One Nation Tories who refused to back Mr Johnsonrsquos deal for leaving the EU.When the Prime Minister finally secured the general election he craved, it was Mr Cummings who came up with another simple but brutally effective slogan ndash ldquoGet Brexit done ndash which helped propel him to an -seat majority.With the Governmentrsquos position finally secure, Mr Cummings set about some of his pet projects, including an overhaul of the machinery of government, warning there was a ldquohard rain coming for Whitehall.A long-standing critic of what he regarded as the Oxbridge mentality which dominated the upper echelons of the civil service, he appealed for ldquoweirdos and misfits with odd skills to transform the way the country was run.He was certainly happy to cultivate the image of himself as the outsider, turning up to work in Downing Street in

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now. But really, any day is a good day to do that."},{"url":null,"title":"vice presidents team takes the honours in tarbert opener","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All money raised will be kept in the area.She said: #Unfortunately, the diagnosis for Dad was too late, but I know how crucial the service Macmillan provides within the rural community is for all families.#Therefore, my aim is to raise awareness and as much money as possible for Macmillan Cancer Support with all money staying in Argyll and Bute. This money is invaluable in supporting families living with cancer locally.#Lindsay is inviting as many people as possible to join her — in a socially distanced manner — for the full walk or as many or few sections as they like.It will be an early rise for those wanting to do the first leg, as the walk is set to begin at .am.The approximate leaving times from Westport for the remaining sections are: .am, .am, .pm and .pm. Further details will be shared nearer the time.There is no need to sign up. Those wishing to join Lindsay on her walk should just show up at one or all of the starting times. Light refreshments will be provided throughout the day.Lindsay#s sister-in-law Leighann Burns, who has been helping promote the challenge, said: #This is a great opportunity for people of all ages to get together to raise money for an invaluable community service.#It would be lovely to see as many people locally take part on the day, socially distanced of course.#Donations can be made on the day or via Lindsay#s JustGiving page. Search #Lindsay Ramsay Walk at Westport# on www.justgivingLindsay is well on her way towards her fundraising target, having already received donations amounting to more than £ by the time the Courier went to press.A Macmillan Cancer support spokesperson said: #At Macmillan, we give people with cancer everything we#ve got. If you are diagnosed, your worries are our worries. We do whatever it takes. But without your help, we can#t support everyone who needs us.#The charity#s Kintyre fundraising group usually holds annual events to raise essential funds but this has not been possible during the Covid- pandemic, so Lindsay#s challenge will provide a welcome boost."},{"url":null,"title":"tennis players return to the sport they love","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone. There are plenty online groups and pages offering guidance and support. DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Tables for Dementia UK#s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity#s annual fundraising event takes place between May  and May .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities.One of the highlights of last year#s event was celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time. These books contain fascinating stories, many with moral teaching in them to guide us along the way of le.Alas, although the bible has sold millions of copies down the ages, it often remains unread and not consulted.Just as binoculars can enrich our vision of the #starry, starry night# so we can enrich our lives by a careful exploration of the bible and discover what it can teach us, so, let#s look at it more closely and take time to enjoy what it has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"council leader backs islands decision","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is very welcome news.#He had also said in a report, which was written in advance of the announcement: #Following the first announcement of forthcoming changes I wrote to Aileen Campbell MSP, then cabinet secretary for communities and local government, seeking an urgent meeting.#We managed to arrange this in early course and I was able to relay to her the very real need for clarity on arrangements for islands, some of which have been in dferent levels to the mainland for some time.#It is to be hoped that, by the time this report is considered by the council, the required clarity has been provided.#The direct impact is of course on the islands themselves but it is also important to bear in mind considerations for adjacent mainland communities as well as Argyll and Bute#s overall social and economic recovery from the pandemic.#"},{"url":null,"title":"support local causes through new argyll community lottery","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He will leave the head of the Old Quay at midday before touring the town centre to get accustomed to the chair.Although the climb can go ahead, restrictions prevented David senior from organising a range of fundraising activities ahead of the event.He had hoped to give the money raised to local key workers, including hospital staff and carers, to reward their hard work throughout the pandemic, with a portion also being donated to Lochaber Mountain Rescue.He said: #I#m sorry I can#t raise the funds for the community – under the circumstances, with Covid restrictions in place, I wasn#t able to organise any events.#I#m really looking forward to the challenge though – David will be the first to go up Ben Nevis in a wheelchair – there was supposed to be another boy going up at the same time as David, but he can#t make it anymore unfortunately.#"},{"url":null,"title":"full time ferry call backed by council","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

No more stressed-out horse or livery owners will mean happier healthier horses – and humans.#The concept for Amazingrazing came to Mr Newall-Smith, aged , six years ago when he owned a horse in The New Forest and struggled to find somewhere suitable when the livery yard closed down.He saw the need for a professionally managed service when he realised the only way to find places currently was through social media groups, local connections or #outdated websites#.#I thought it was mad that in this day and age, the main way people find livery is word-of-mouth and Facebook groups,# Mr Newall-Smith said. #I thought there must be a better way.#After being made redundant from his job shortly before the Covid- pandemic began, Mr Newall-Smith, a design engineer who studied at Bournemouth University, decided to develop Amazingrazing with his free time at home during lockdown providing the perfect opportunity to get the business off the ground.Livery owner and equestrian business consultant John McDonald said: #I work with liveries and meet horse owners every day and know that finding the right horse owners for your yard is critical.#Liveries are a community and getting the right balance of personalities is important to help develop harmony on the yard. Amazingrazing allows livery and horse owners to get to know each other before making a commitment. This, I am certain, will help greatly to take the stress out of running a livery and owning a horse.#Find out more about Amazingrazing, which officially launches in June , at Amazingrazing.A lot of horse owners like the livery they are at but when they move they struggle to find one which has similar features as most liveries don’t have websites and,they do, they are often out of date.Livery and horse owners often clash over the best way to look after the horse. To the owner, the horse is an extension of their family and they want to make sure it is done correctly, however, often the livery has dferent ideas on how this should be done, and this often leads to disputes.The cost of livery can be considerable, sometimes similar to renting a flat. A lot of the time, there are no contracts between either party, so when things go wrong, it can get messy quickly and there are many horror stories from both sides. Issues such as neglect of horses, horse owners leaving the horse and not ing, unpaid field rent and bullying are just some issues. There are dedicated Facebook pages for both bad liveries and bad horse owners.Livery yards in general don#t struggle to find horse owners but they do struggle to find horse owners that are reliable and trustworthy, pay on time, aren’t dficult to work with and look after their horse properly. They want a service which allows them to vet horse owners and their horses before they meet them.Equally, horse owners want to be able to vet liveries before travelling long distances and committing to large amounts of money to a yard that does not have the facilities they are after.When using the Amazingrazing site, users can:In the last year, Amazingrazing founder Felix Newall-Smith has conducted surveys with horse and livery owners, created a Facebook page which has so far amassed , followers, developed and tested a #click through# website with potential future users. He then started the ball rolling with a Weymouth-based web developer and the website, which is now  per cent complete, is due to launch in June .To get the word out about Amazingrazing and raise the business profile, so far Mr Newall-Smith has employed a guerrilla marketing technique using social media presence, brand ambassadors, online influencers and targeted equestrian business networking events with great success so far.With very little competition, Mr Newall-Smith believes that Amazingrazing will quickly take over the market. Once established, there are plans to improve the service, giving members greater benefits such as training on how to look after a horse and how to improve livery businesses as well as an Amazingrazing app."},{"url":null,"title":"superb play from mcconnachie in dunavertys spring meeting","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

exactly why is Fionn MacCoul buried here  he asked.Izzy promised she would tell the story later, when they reached the site where legend tells he was killed by a giant.Then, at Finnrsquos request, they walked to nearby Finlarig Castle.Izzy had always felt the castle had a sombre atmosphere, and so it did, even on this sun-drenched afternoon.Maybe itrsquos because it is quietly hidden away from the tourist trail, its unstable ruins concealed by old trees.Normally a tranquil place feels magical, but the grim deeds said to have been committed here darken the feelings.Izzy had already told Finn of the castle and he wanted to see the beheading pit and hanging tree.It was another built by the Campbell chief lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo at the beginning of the s ndash such a ruthless man, andaccounts of him were true, very cruel even for his time.At Finlarig, it is said, he enacted his lsquojusticersquo, in particular against the MacGregors, whose land he had taken and whom he hunted mercilessly.Finn stood in the pit where, according to tradition, noble victims were executed.Their Campbell persecutors could watch and gloat from a window above in the tower.Nearby was the hanging tree, where people of lesser status were said to have met their end.Finn found the overgrown steps that led to the summit of the small hill on which the tree grew.They stood on the spot where so many condemned men would have had their last view of this world.ldquoYoursquore right, aunty, this place does have a bit of a gothic atmosphere, especially when you know that so many people were hanged on the branches of this tree.Izzy nodded: ldquoBut remember, Finn, eventhis is the original hanging tree, then it is innocent, she said as they stood under its boughs.ldquoThe poor thing was used to commit terrible crimes, she put her hand on its trunk, ldquobut it wasnrsquot the treersquos fault.Finn wasnrsquot sureshe was joking itrsquos just a tree, how could it be blamed He put it down to his auntrsquos love of nature.She often spoke asplants and animals were like people.Finn looked around.ldquoCan you tell me a story about this place  he asked.Izzy thought for a moment, then agreed.They sat on a stone by an old holly tree in the sunshine and Izzy told two stories.First, the tale of a wedding at the castle interrupted by MacDonalds lting cattle.Then she told the tale of Marion Campbell, a daughter of a powerful Campbell chief.She had been promised to a man she didnrsquot love, but instead she eloped with Gregor Roy MacGregor, the chief of the MacGregors.ldquoThe sad thing is, explained Izzy, ldquothat beforehand the MacGregors and Campbells had been close allies for many generations, but then a feud over land and power developed.So Gregor Roy was forced into the hills as an outlaw, and Marion willingly joined him, marrying him against her fatherrsquos wishes.ldquoDespite their tough le, said Izzy, ldquothey deeply loved each other.Finn was fascinated as Izzy told Finn stories of their adventures of how they lived in the wilds, living in secret hideouts, hunted by the warriors of Marionrsquos father.She told the tale of how Gregor once escaped his pursuers by leaping over a river and how Marion gave birth to their first son in a cave.ldquoThey wrought vengeance on the Campbells, lting their cattle, said Izzy, ldquobut eventually they were found and Gregor was beheaded by a Campbell chief called Grey Colin in .ldquoIn the beheading pit  asked Finn.ldquoNo, not here, said Izzy, ldquobut at another castle at the east end of Loch Tay.\"Some accounts say poor Marion was forced to watch, and afterwards she composed a beautul lament, which is a sad song.\"She wrote it for her son, to explain to him what had happened to his father.Izzy recited a verse she could remember: ldquoEven in snow and blizzards, And days with all the seasons, Gregor would find a hollow for me, In which we would sleep cosily.ldquoWow, what a story. What happened to her after  asked Finn.Izzy shook her head: ldquoNobody knows, she disappears from history, but her son Alistair later avenged his fatherrsquos death and so the feuding continued, which explains the grim deeds at this castle.ldquoMaybe her son protected her after and hid her to keep her safe, wondered Finn.ldquoThatrsquos a nice thought, maybe.Finn stood up and walked around.ldquoIt would be betterfolks could just get on, donrsquot you think! he announced.ldquoAgreed! said Izzy.They walked back to the village.They had a much-needed wash with hot water and Finn called his mum.After a while, he poked his head out of the phone box: ldquoMum wants to talk to you.Izzy knew how dficult this time was for her sister, being separated from her son overnight for the first time in four years.But Izzy was trusted by her and Finnrsquos attachment to his aunt was very strong and made him feel safe.He was obviously missing his mother, but he seemed to be enjoying the journey and his moods had been better, so it was decided the journey could continue.ldquoRemember, mumrsquos back from Spain on Monday eve.ldquoI know, smiled Izzy, ldquowe will be there to meet her, I promise.After the call, they did some shopping and made a quick visit to the Folk Museum, which was housed in the old mill by the side of the river.Izzy wanted to show Finn St Fillanrsquos Stones, which were on display there ndash a tale to tell later when they went for a swim in his pool.As they walked back onto the bridge, Izzy had a surprise.She unlocked the gate which led to the old MacNab burial ground, where chiefs of the clan lie in a walled enclosure, their clan folk in the surrounding ground.ldquoItrsquos actually an island in the middle of the river, explained Izzy.ldquoIts name means yellow island. It was a prehistoric fort before it was a burial ground.Finn nodded as he walked round the edge, looking through the trees down at the river as it roared, then calmed its way to Loch Tay.Izzy spotted a carving of the MacNab crest, with an image of the head of a MacNeish chief, a reminder of a famous incident in the clanrsquos history.ldquoIrsquom getting hungry, aunty, said Finn.She had a plan for tea.They would eat within the ruins of Rob Royrsquos house at Auchinchisallen in Glen Dochart.It was a -minute drive west of Killin.They parked at a small layby just past the small bridge that took the busy traffic over the burn called Allt Coire Chaorach.ldquoThat there  asked Finn, pointing at the ruins.ldquoLooks like mostly a pile of stones with a chimney.ldquoItrsquos called Rob Royrsquos house, letrsquos have our tea there, said Izzy.ldquoReally, it was his house  How do we get to it It was a good question.Once they got over the gate, they followed a narrow bracken-covered path.They got scratched as they scrambled up a steep slope, but suddenly they were on the top and the ruined house was in front of them.They were only a short distance from the road, but it felt like a dferent world.Finn stood on a large stone that once formed part of the foundations and looked up at the one gable end that was still standing.No, it wasnrsquot just a pile of stones, he thought, he could see it had been a house.Finn scanned the landscape around him.Occasional traffic could be heard not far below, but the road seemed engulfed and made insignicant by the mountains and hills that dominated the view.A herd of highland cattle were grazing nearby.ldquoLook, look! We have our own Highland cows! Finn called to his aunt.ldquoPerfect, she said as she her puffed her way to the house.Finn jumped from the stone down to his aunt.ldquoSorry, let me help, he said.ldquoLetrsquos get set up said Izzy, laying the heavy rucksack down.Finn went for a closer look at the cattle while Izzy found a safe place to sit within the ruins.She got out the camping stove and began to cook.Finn joined her and they stared at the pasta as it twirled in the boiling water.The cows came to watch, standing in a row, tails twitching with a fascinated look on their faces.ldquoYoursquore right in what you said, aunty, remarked Finn between mouthfuls of pasta.Izzy curled her eyebrows not sure what he was referring to.ldquoFood tastes much better when itrsquos cooked outside, in a place like this, he explained with a big sauce-covered grin.The sun was now lowering in the sky and Izzy could feel the air finally cooling.The huge presence of Ben More was casting shadows in the glen.She took out her small fire dish, screwed on its legs and placed it carefully within the ruins, away from any vegetation.Finn suggested moving some stones to make more comfortable seats.ldquoWe are guests here, said Izzy, ldquowe are sitting amongst old ruins, and we must leave them exactly as we found them. Even our wee fire must leave no trace. There used to be a sign here telling people about this place, but people just didnrsquot respect it, theyrsquod damaged it or trash it, so the sign was taken away. We know better, so we are welcome guests.Finn nodded. He initially felt upbraided, but his aunt gave him a kind smile which changed the meaning of her words.Instead of feeling scolded, he felt a strange sense of privilege that hersquod been taught something important.ldquoThink how long this house has been here, said Izzy, who looked up at the gable end with the chimney.ldquoThat standing wall was added later, but it is said Rob built the original house here in . It was a time when he was a hunted outlaw.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likely that you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protection it is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others than people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their own they need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optional in more places.We are optimistic that immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twist here, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellip... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one isimmunity doesnrsquot last long enough without a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one isthe virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.The gradual easing of restrictions that have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travel might need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"work-progressing-400-home-development-longniddry","story":"Work at the site ndash being marketed as lsquoLongniddry Villagersquo ndash has been ongoing for more than a year.The East Coast Main Line railway is all that separates the new development from the existing Longniddry settlement.But the site of the new homes is actually where lsquooldrsquo Longniddry once stood, hence its lsquoLongniddry Villagersquo name.This week, ZeroC, part of Places for People, opened the doors to its new show home in the development.Longniddry Village is being developed in partnership with landowners Wemyss and March Estates.Maps dating back to the s show that half of the old village of Longniddry was to the south of where the railway now runs, on the site of the present Longniddry Farm.When John Glassell acquired most of the lands of the village in , the pace of change increased and many of the remaining houses and buildings in the village were cleared for agriculture.The railway arrived in  and land previously owned by Mr Glassell was passed firstly to the House of Argyll and then to the Wemyss and March Estates, with the many new homes being built to the north of the railway line in the s.Allison Sutherland, regional sales and marketing director for Places for People in Scotland, said: ldquoItrsquos been an exciting time for Places for People to deliver our first ZeroC development in East Lothian, which delivers a fresh approach to building homes in the area.

Over their  years in charge, the SNP have slashed funding for council budgets, which has had a massive impact on local services like our roads, schools and bin collections. Communities here, particularly our rural ones, have been neglected by the SNP, forcing young people to move where to live and work.As we rebuild, communities must be at the heart of everything we do. Our manesto pledges to introduce a Communities Bill which will enshrine fair funding for local authorities like East Lothian. We will also invest pound million in community investment deals, worth up to pound million each, directly investing in skilled jobs here.But none of this is possiblethe SNP win a majority.

Seriously, Ms Sturgeon was making a pertinent point. Which is that a staged fight over who is the most avid for independence might momentarily amuse the zealous, as they formed a ring, chanting ldquofight, fight, fight.She noted, however, that it would do nothing to impress those who remain unpersuaded by the merits of independence in the first place. They might simply turn away, faintly nauseated.Which is why the leitmot of Ms Sturgeonrsquos launch was continuity. As it has been for the entire campaign thus far.That seems to me particularly apt this week. Today brings the funeral service for the Duke of Edinburgh. The arrangements are, inevitably and rightly, suppressed by Covid.But, still, the gathering at Windsor offers a visible reminder of the core constitutional continuity presented by the Royal Family, alongside the collective desire to give thanks for a le of long and devoted service.Events occasionally conspire, Oprah Winfrey et al, to make many of us contemplate the Royal Family asthey were stars in a soap opera, a source of innocent merriment or exaggerated empathy.They are, of course, much more. They are ldquothe firm. They are the much-altered but still salient Royal prerogative. They are the palpable core of the United Kingdom.When party leaders at Holyrood paid tribute this week, it was left to Patrick Harvie of the Greens to note, en passant, that support for the institution of Monarchy was not universal in Scotland. However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament. She opts for popular pragmatism. She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant. Merely that they are dferent, that they are regarded by the people as conduits towards the issues which dominate their thoughts, such as employment, health and security.That is the error the Tories previously made when they used to say that devolution was never raised on the doorsteps. They needed to ask a second question: how best might you address the concerns you have raised Nicola Sturgeon gets that distinction. She understands the yearning for stability in a time of turmoil. That is why her offer, for the most enthusiastic fans of independence, is Paradise Deferred.Our columns are s for writers to express their opinions.They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":null,"title":"election-2021-lobbygate-independence-better-uks-pirate-republic","story":"Mr Winton, now sadly departed, was the flamboyant presenter of Supermarket Sweep, one of the most subversive shows in Britainrsquos formidable daytime television canon.

Blair himself built a massive property portfolio while pimping himself out as a sort of international, travelling peace salesman. In office, Blair committed British troops to seven wars, all of which provided him with ample opportunity to make the connections in the Arab world that would provide a few extra zeroes in his pension.

That changed in Cleveland where civic bodies dramatically changed their attitude to the criminal waste of millions of dollars flowing from the city every year in \"best value\" contracts awarded to massive, zero-hour contract-deploying companies headquartered where.Read more:Salmond: Indyref: Will the Alba Party help or hinder the cause of independence It was a mini civic revolution, which could happen in Scotland too,central government, councils, health boards, universities and quangos could operate together to extract better value from the billions they spend in our name every year through procurement processes that are currently stacked to suit massive outsourcing specialists like Serco ndash an outsourcing giant whose profits soared as its disastrous test-and-trace system recently collapsed.Of course, such a dramatic change from the old \"safe\" best value outlook, will inevitably create problems.Chief amongst them, the need to ditch the deep-seated belief that still persists amongst managers and professionals, that economies of scale are supremely important to achieve ndash no matter how disastrous the big company performance or how many capable, smaller, local firms ndash starved of public sector contracts ndash go to the wall.British governments have always agreed that big is beautul ndash in the shape of massive nationalised industries or equally large corporate players. But now the privatising zeal of Margaret Thatcher has combined with Boris Johnsonrsquos contracts for cronies, to make this size issue more extreme.There are a lot more contracts knocking about and theyrsquove grown steadily larger, more complex and consequently lie even further beyond the reach of local firms.Big is automatically seen as a guarantor of success ndash even though banks that were \"too big\" did fail and small countries, with ultra-local government and a highly developed instinct for self-reliance have been held up as exemplars during the pandemic.EU procurement rules have been blamedfor carving local suppliers out, since contracts over a certain size had to be advertised across the whole European Union. But councils were always allowed to select bids based on quality, risk, social value, food miles and other factors besides price.The proof of that pudding is Preston Council which used the Cleveland Model to double its spending with local businesses in the pre-Brexit period of -. It used a weighting system that scored local labour recruitment and skills training to award contracts to local firms. In  Preston was declared the most improved city in the UK, by an independent Demos report and the cityrsquos unemployment rate halved as local procurement spending rose in the five years to .In Scotland, innovative councils like Aberdeen have also awarded public contracts to local food producers by inserting food miles into their selection criteria whilst remaining ldquoEU compliant.Where therersquos a will therersquos a way.So, does the absence of a Scottish Cleveland or Preston suggest a lack of political will here Community Wealth Building made an appearance in the SNPrsquos programme for government last year prompting councils like Glasgow City to trial small, pilot projects. According to leader Susan Aitken, the council now intends to build on its experience and announce a city-wide Circular Economy Action Plan.This is the scale of ambition neededthe Covid recovery and Green transition ndash more empty buzzwords during this election campaign ndash are not to become disappointing missed opportunities.We lack the \"patient capital\" that allowed Cleveland to set about transforming itself. But with this election, Scotland has a political opportunity to radically change procurement policy so that our council tax millions invest in local people to deliver local services.We need pump-priming councils who think like local economic dynamos, so that what goes around in taxpayer cash, comes around in locally sourced jobs.And we need a new Holyrood Government willing to lead by example.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Small town big dreams.I gave up watching football years ago, partly out of revulsion at how it has become a playground for plutocrats, but mainly because its become pretty boring. Id rather watch the dads playing park football ndash theres a lot more goals for a start. So I was supremely indferent to the news that some English clubs with more money than sense had decided to join a breakaway European Super League. Better off without them.However, the mega-stushie in the beautul game has now taken on an unexpected political signicance. The future king has joined with the Prime Minister to condemn this European League of Greed. Boris Johnson has promised to blitz the ESL with ldquoa legislative bomb.Im not entirely sure the government can prevent these foreign-owned private businesses crossing continents, but never mind. This is a Red Wall issue. Sir Keir Starmer has also cried foul and called on the government to take back control, asthis were another dimension of Brexit. MACWHIRTER:Alba needs a U-turn after its car crash campaignThe European Super League has nothing whatever to do with the European Union, but it does with something underlying it: globalisation. It is part of the relentless march of capitalist expansion across national borders, leaving the little people behind. And there has been a hint of Brexit in the way commentators have condemned the mega clubs for betraying their country and community. Pundits on the left have been sounding like Nigel Farage wondering whatever happened to patriotism and loyalty to ones own.It is all about money, of course. The founding clubs will reportedly share pound billion courtesy of JP Morgan, which is one of the mega banks now financing Big Footie. This is to help them adjust to the rarefied atmosphere of global football, and is absolutely not intended as a bribe, or to buy the lads a drink. It is also to cover their vast debts.Fans and football governing bodies like UEFA are furious. The left-behind clubs stand to lose a heap of money by not being included in this European Super League. Politicians and football celebrities like Gary Lineker are attacking the breakaway clubs for disrespecting the fans and for polluting the Peoples Game with filthy lucre.There is, it has to be said, just a hint of hypocrisy in this outrage from wealthy ex-players and managers. British football is hardly a model of affordable community sport. The Premier league is all about money ndash mainly TV cash ndash which has been used to pay ludicrous sums to the primping prima donnas of the pitch. The main reason the sports personalities and clubs are worried now is that some of their money will be creamed off by the super leaguers.Defenders of the ESL say its just the way the game is going in the age of globalisation. They claim that many of the big clubs, far from minting it, are actually dicing with bankruptcy. This is partly because of Covid, but mainly because of the huge debts they have incurred trying to maintain their standing in the world and keep their fans happy. To survive, the top clubs need to cash in on that global status. Playing a wet Wednesday in Stoke doesnt make it.READMORE MACWHIRTER:Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe fans arent entirely innocent bystanders here. Theyve wanted success above all ndash silverware in the boardroom. To quote Bill Shankly: ldquoIf you are first youre firstyoure second youre nothing. To win nowadays is hugely expensive. Superstar Lionel Messis contract with FC Barcelona is worth over poundm a year. This may help explain why the world-famous club is in pound.bn in debt.Of course, theres a simple answer to that cash flow problem: just dont pay them. But that doesnt work in the global sports marketplace, apparently. From the point of view of clubs like Manchester United, who apparently have more fans in India than in England, it is all about giving their viewers what they want. It is no more objectionable, they say, than rock bands performing in mega stadiums on world tours. No one says the Rolling Stones are abandoning their fans and following the money.If people keep paying, the Super League will probably happen, sooner or later, whatever the politicians say. As for Scottish football ndash well, nothing to see here since no team in Scotland is remotely in contention. Which in many ways is a very good thing. Every few years there are rumours about Rangers and Celtic plotting to join the English Premier league on the grounds that they cant afford to continue in the small pond of Scottish football. But it never seems to happen.This could be an opportunity for Scottish football to go precisely the other way: become a sport which was more about local fellowship than global finance. Be more like the Jags. Partick Thistle is one of a small but growing number of Scottish clubs that are owned by their supporters. Mind you that was because of the generosity of the late Colin Weir, who essentially bought the club to give it to the fans. I doubtthe American Glazer family, who own Man U, will do likewise.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Golf is now wreathed in Meltwater Mentions, MVP Indexes and Nin Brand Exposures. And, no, I donrsquot know what the Dickens they are either.Known as the Player Impact Program ndash yes, you can start rolling your eyes and sighing now ndash the PGA Tour, according to a report in The Heraldrsquos US sister publication Golfweek, has tucked away an annual pot of some poundm to reward those players who, in the organisationrsquos own words, ldquopositively move the needle. It sounds like a phrase yoursquod hear on an episode of the Great British Sewing Bee to be completely honest.Those aforementioned Meltwater thingamabobs, MVP gobbledygooks and Nin Brand whatchamacallits will be used to generate an inidual impact score for a player. His position on the season-ending FedEx Cup rankings, based on his actual golfing performances, will be a key driver but other factors, such as popularity in an online Google search, the number of minutes he appears on TV and his social media presence will all be tossed into the mix.When the numbers are crunched and algorithms are formed, presumably by some boggle-eyed boffins in a subterranean laboratory, the player who tops the impact order of merit will get a cheque for over pound.m. Itrsquos nice workyou can generate it.You donrsquot need to be one of those boffins to figure out that all of this will be weighted in the favour of the top brass, who already command vast sponsorship, air-time and appearance fees, while the rest diddle along as the rich get richer. Itrsquos not a new tale but one re-packaged for a digital age.Apparently, the scheme was launched in January but,Xander Schauffelersquos response yesterday was anything to go by, this all-singing, all-dancing push for fan and sponsor engagement has not, well, engaged. ldquoWe dont know much about it, said the world No  ahead of this weekrsquos PGA Tour stop in New Orleans. ldquoApparently we were told about it in January.

Either that, or a jaw-dropping indulgence of money that would be better served going into dferent levels of the golfing pyramid.When the Saudi-bankrolled Premier Golf Leaguewas proposed last year, the PGA Tour and the European Tour got the kind of almighty fright you used to get with the shower scene in Psycho.Fearing their marquee names would jolly off to the unbridled riches of a closed-shop extravaganza, a ldquostrategic alliance between the two tours was duly forged. When the likes of Rory McIlroy distanced himself from the PGL, there was a considerable sigh of relief on both sides of the pond. Player power was always going to dictate affairs.In the wake of his retreat, McIlroy suggested that the temptations of the PGL proposal would provide a ldquocatalyst for some changes on thisTour that can help it grow and move forward.This multi-million dollar sweetener has certainly offered another gold-plated carrot on a stick in a game which doesnrsquot just see money talk, but roar in your face.

But not with your boss, evenyour boss is the First Minister of Scotland. If my boss tried to sleepy cuddle me Irsquod be straight to Human Resources and hersquod probably be on his way to the hospital.Yet that is one of the things we know Alex Salmond did with a colleague during his time as leader of this country.The married -year-old also says he had consensual sex with a colleague, and stroked anotherrsquos face while she was sleeping, apparently to try and ldquowake her up.The reason I point this out is because it is something Mr Salmond wants desperately to get away from ndash and which some journalists are more than happy to oblige.Sure, Channel  news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy gave him a grilling on the day he launched his new political party, March , and my own colleague Tom Gordon did similar ndash askinghe was still a creep and bully, orhe had reformed.But those questions, fielded by predominantly male political journalists, have dwindled somewhat.Alongside this, Mr Salmond has become more aggressive in his responsesanyone dare ask him why he is fit to stand for political office. It follows a pattern: he repeats that he has gone through ldquotwo court trials, three inquiries and was cleared before berating the journalist for ldquotrying to re-try him.There is one problem with his approach. How are the electorate meant to judge his suitabilityhe will not address the elephant in the room  Thatrsquos why the questions, no matter how bullish and rude the responses, should not stop coming.This hasnrsquot always happened because histo politics has injected excitement into what would, until his arrival, have been a relatively boring election campaign.His behaviour, which surely would have seen him forced to resign had he been in office when it became public, is being slowly brushed aside.After all, it isnrsquot like there arenrsquot other things to report on when it comes to the Alba Party. Many of their online events have been plagued by technical dficulties, which has left Salmond standing in front of a microphone like a bingo caller while his helpers try to fix the internet connection, making a joke, or possibly a new policy idea, about improving the broadband in Scotland.When asked in one recent interview with Sky Newsrsquo Adam Boulton about his conduct with women the former FM trotted out his usual answer: ldquoI like the way you wave away the trialshellip A trial in front of a jury in which I was acquitted. A jury, incidentally, with a majority of women on it, in front of a lady judge. He went on: ldquoI think most fair minded people will say lsquoThatrsquos that, itrsquos time to move onrsquo. I donrsquotthink Sky Television should be trying to retry me.Mr Salmond may want to move on, which is all well and good, except being acquitted in a criminal trial does not explain away non-criminal behaviour.His defence was centred around the former first ministerrsquos assertion that his conduct, while indecent, was not criminal. That was, he has always insisted, a line he never crossed.But there is a line between the criminal and the indecent and that is where Mr Salmond owes the electorate an explanation.How are voters expected to decidehe is fit toto Holyroodhe wonrsquot address these questions  How will women in Holyrood feel about his past behaviour This is not about the Alba Party, let me be clear about that. Diversity in politics is good, and some have suggested a move like this has been on the cards for while.With the SNP being such a broad church, and its only truly unying goal being independence, it makes sense that other issues such as the gender recognition act reform, or even how to achieve independence, would begin to split the party. Those who have joined Alba are seeking a new way of achieving independence and have strong views on womenrsquos rights which they believe are being eroded by attempts to reform the gender recognition act.These are important issues they should be discussed.It is also entirely legitimate for those candidates to seek a better political home for their views.The problem is that Salmond is its leader, and some of its supporters already know this presents dficulties. Albarsquos policies on womenrsquos rights may be taken far more seriouslythis were not the case.Particularly so as Mr Salmond appears to be using the support of women in his new party as a proxy an attempt to show that there is no problem with his behaviour of the past.When it was pointed out to him recently that ldquosome people are a little bit dubious about your record with women, he instantly replied: ldquoClearly some of the strongest feminist voices in Scottish politics are not, otherwise they wouldnrsquot be our party candidates.The problem is, womenrsquos concerns about gender recognition and the behaviour of one man, who was the most powerful man in Scotland at one point, are very dferent issues.If Mr Salmond truly wanted to show he cared about womenrsquos rights and safety, he should look at his own past behaviour and start answering the questions. Instead he is hiding behind female juries, lady judges and female politicians."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12531970.jpg?type=article-full","title":"snp-miss-majority-holyrood-election-support-scottish-independence-dips-latest-polls-show","story":"The Savanta ComRes survey for The Scotsman predictedthat the party will MSPs in total ndash two short of a majority ndash the same number as in .However there would still be a pro-independence majority at Holyrood, with the Scottish Greens forecast toeight MSPs, two more than , and the party predicted to secure % of the list vote in .Only % of voters said they plan to vote for Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party, which would leave it without a single MSP elected.The poll projects that the SNP willa constituency vote of % and a list vote of % in the May  election.It predicts that the Scottish Conservatives will achieve % of the constituency vote and % of the regional list, which would see it MSPs ndash one more than in .Scottish Labour is forecast to% on the constituency and % on the list vote and is predicted to MSPs, three fewer than in .The Scottish Liberal Democrats are predicted tofive MSPs, the same number as in , with % of the constituency and % of the list vote.The poll of , Scottish adults also found that support for Scottish independence is split, though support for No has increased since a survey at the start of April.The latest poll found that % would vote No in an independence referendum, while % would vote Yes, with the remainder undecided.When ldquodonrsquot knows are excluded, % support No and % said they would vote Yes.A survey at the start of April found thatan independence referendum was to be held tomorrow, % would vote Yes and the same proportion No, with the remainder undecided.The latest poll was carried out between April  and .Meanwhile, support for Scottish independence is at itslowest level since over a year, according toYouGov research forThe Times.The poll found that  per cent of voters want Scotland to be an independent country, not including undecided voters.In early March, when YouGovlastasked the questions, support was two percentage points higher.Support of % represents the least support for independence since December .When all voters are included,  per cent said they would vote ldquono and  per cent ldquoyes in a referendum askingScotland should become an independent country.Meanwhile, ten per cent of voters were undecided, fourper cent would not vote and twoper cent refused to disclose their intentions.The research also reported \"pushback\" against the plansfrom Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond to focus on independence soon after the Holyrood election next month.Only  per cent of voters said they thought there should be another ballot onSturgeonrsquos timetable, with  per cent opposed.However, there was more support for a referendum being held in the next five years, with  per cent in favour,  per cent opposed and  per cent unsure.Ms Sturgeon has previouslyconfirmed she will be seeking another referendum before the end of .Mr Salmond has said he would demand that independence negotiations with Whitehall begin immediately.He has repeatedly criticised the SNPs lack of action on the matter of independence.It comes as The Scottish Trades Union Congressvoted yesterday to back another independence referenduma majority of MSPs are in favour of the move after May  ndash but it stressed the immediate priority is recovering from the pandemic.The announcement is the result of a vote at the bodyrsquos annual meeting, which concluded it is for the Scottish Parliament to decide when oranother referendum should be held.But the union bosses rejected attempts to gain a supermajority of MSPs in favour of independence by the Alba Party by using what it calls ldquotactical manoeuvring, fearing it may undermine the sovereignty of voters as Scotland remains broadly split on the question of independence.STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said: ldquoOur vote today has reaffirmed the right of the Scottish people to self-determination and recognised that as the central democratic institution in Scotland, our Parliament should have the power to determine whether and when to hold a second referendum.ldquoBut we have also asserted that economic and social recovery is our priority, and that radical policy is needed to achieve that in a way that redresses current imbalances of power and wealth. We will hold to account all parties of all political colours who take their eye off that ball.Ms Foyer also said any second vote would not have to be a straight choice between independence and remaining in the UKa ldquomeaningful third option is developed.Since before the  referendum, some have said the possibility of ldquodevolution max should be explored, where Scotland remains part of the UK but is given substantially more powers than are currently held at Holyrood, with only major portfolios such as defence reserved to Westminster."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-retired-teachers-help-close-attainment-gap","story":"Poverty and educational inequality have co-existed for a long time. I started teaching at the age of  in a Fe mining community, where deprivation stared me in the face. I came across one wee girl whose attendance at school was very erratic.When I questioned her, she tearfully explained that she could not manage to school every day because she had to share a pair of shoes with her brother. The ldquoshoes were a pair of leaky welly boots.My sister came to the rescue with some second-hand shoes, which led to an immediate improvement in attendance and attainment.There were great hopes and expectations that the comprehensive revolution of the s would narrow the attainment gap. When he was Secretary of State for Scotland, Willie Ross introduced comprehensive education without even the need for an Act of Parliament. He simply sent out a circular to all local authorities telling them to abolish selection and fee-paying in all state schools.Such radical measures certainly helped, yet here we are, over half a century later, still talking about the need to narrow the attainment gap.It would be wrong, of course, to confuse equality of attainment with equality of opportunity.The former is unachievable but the latter is both achievable and desirable. What, then, can be done to improve the attainment of pupils from deprived areas First of all, extra resources must be concentrated on those who are most in need. Smaller class sizes, homework clubs and the provision of home internet connection would help, but I have always believed that the most valuable educational resource is a good teacher and sometimes good teaching requires one-to-one communication, especially for pupils who experience dficulties.An increasing number of parents seem to be paying for extra private tuition for their children but many parents on low incomes simply cannot afford the additional cost. The inevitable result is a widening of the attainment gap.The Scottish Government should intervene by organising and paying for the recruitment of a pool of unemployed and retired teachers who are willing to give a few hoursrsquo or even one hour per weekrsquos tuition to young people from deprived home backgrounds.Most retired teachers understandably want to enjoy their retirement but there may be some with time on their hands who would be very capable of giving one-to-one tuition, possibly in the comfort their own home, when Covid restrictions are eased.At the start of the current pandemic, retired NHS staff were asked to consider helping out. The same pandemic threatens to widen even further the educational attainment gap, with long-term devastating consequences for a whole generation of deprived young people. Would enough retired teachers respond to the challenge An imaginative recruitment campaign is worth a try.Dennis Canavan, Bannockburn.Taking children out of povertyIT is, of course, entirely John Milnersquos choice as to how he will vote in May , but I find it strange that he has placed his trust in Anas Sarwar to alleviate child poverty, as Mr Sarwar, by his own admission, wonrsquot be in power after Mayrsquos election, and has his sights set on coming second.Given the wide-ranging proposals put forward by someone who does have her sights set on winning the election and lting children out of poverty, with such mechanisms as doubling the new and unique to Scotland Child Benefit, providing free breakfasts and lunches for all primary school children, and laptops or tablets for all school pupils, with a wrap-around system of childcare free to low-income families, I would suggest that the best route to take children out of poverty would be for Mr Milne to give both his votes to the SNP.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Defending the indefensibleMAYBE Bob MacDougallis stretching credibility to suggest that, in an independent Scotland, shipyards couldnrsquot contract for overseas orders. Here are some equally bizarre extrapolations of my own: the remaining , or so BAE systems workers throughout the UK making these frigates could have been made millionaires for half the cost of the frigates so far.The frigates in turn are being built to help protect two new aircraft carriers the UK can only ever use in distant offensive actions ndash assuming, that is, that the UK can ever afford enough planes of its own to fly from them to make the circumstances viable. The F- Lightning planes cost pound million a pop and are so expensive to run that the US, which makes them, are considering scrapping the . trillion project and designing a new plane.To sum up: Westminster is building frigates to defend horrendously expensive aircraft carriers that may soon become redundant. Perhaps an independent Scotland may be better at husbanding its financial resources.David J Crawford, Glasgow.A parting of the ways THE one thing that Scotland appears to be a world leader in is poverty.Not only do we have serious issues such as child and fuel poverty, but with the recent revelation that one in seven Scottish adults apparently suffers from ldquodata poverty there is yet another ldquopoverty to add to the ever-expanding list along with ldquonature, ldquohygiene, ldquoexercise, ldquospiritual and ldquoculture in Scotland.Personally, I suffer from ldquohair poverty. How do I get a Scottish Government grant for this David Bone, Girvan.Guarantee of EU membershipSCOTLAND is, and always has been, a relatively poor country.The one action which rescued Scotland from its third-world status was the Act of Union with England in  to form the United Kingdom, a union which has proved to be immensely profitable for both Scotland and England.The disaster that is Brexit shows only too clearly the perils of setting up more boundaries between countries, as Britain has done with its former principal trading partner, Europe. For Scotland to commit a similar act of folly with its principal trading partner, England, would be catastrophic. The so-called answer proposed by the SNP is for Scotland, as a separate country, to jointhe EU.Apart from the fact that Scotland would have far less freedom as a member of the EU than it has as a devolved part of the UK, there is the serious question of whether Scotland would be accepted as a member of the EU.Scotland has a much larger capital debt than is allowed under EU rules, and its membership would have to be approved by all of the existing members of the EU. This includes countries such as Spain, which already has its own independence problem with the province of Catalonia, which is unlikely to make it sympathetic to Scotlandrsquos cause.It would be madness to hold a referendum on Scottish independence until the Scottish Government has obtained an unqualied guarantee from the whole of the EU that Scotland, on becoming independent, would be accepted as a full member of the Union, and on what terms.The alternative of independence outside the EU and outside all other trading blocks, with nocurrency and no international bank, is suicidal.Finally, it must not be forgotten that the Westminster Government can be voted out of office at not more than five-year intervals, while the break-up of the UK would be permanent and irreversible.James Cormie, Perth.Look abroad for neutral chairmanNEIL Mackaywrites that Nigel Boardman, selected by Boris Johnson to head the inquiry, has links to a private bank which has links to the Tory party.Whether this will skew the outcome remains to be seen. In view of the need to have the inquiry headed by a neutral chairman, would it not be better to get a lawyer from Australia, Canada or New Zealand to head it  Andnot, why not George Smith, Clydebank.Who believes Boris now ALTHOUGH briefly a briefing room, the million-pound makeover of Number  Downing Street tells us a great deal about the Prime Minister.He takes up fancies with great enthusiasm and trumpet-blowing then quickly drops them when he tires of them or they become inconvenient or embarrassing or are revealed as vain folly.Even on the day of debriefing the briefing room he was at it again, impetuously announcing that all measures would be taken to prevent the proposed football European Super League and that he would legislate against it.The league seems to have fallen apart faster than his promise, of course.

This has been maliciously and cynically twisted for political ends, and demands have been made that I apologise for things I never said and do not believe.ILGA and Stonewall have issued statements saying they donrsquot condone paedophilia ndash I never suggested that they did.Like many others, I was concerned that the ILGA had adopted the ldquoFeminist Declaration, which calls for the elimination of laws that limit the legal capacity of adolescents to consent to sex.There is no expansion or cross-reference on the definition of ldquoadolescent which the United Nations and World Health Organisation and most international organisations determine as being between ten and . The document has been described as ldquomorally repugnant in the Gay Press.All sorts of justications have circulated ndash Unisonsuggested that it was written by someone who didnrsquot speak English as a first language, others that the term ldquoadolescent is non-numerical defining the in-between stage of childhood and adulthood, others again that the document probably doesnrsquot mean what is says it does.But words matter ndash and lobbying organisations know they do. This lobbying organisation, in particular, should be much more careful given its own chequered history ndash three times refused ECOSOC status as an NGO because of its association with pro-paedophile organisations ndash again information obtainable from their own website.Why did I single out the ILGA as one signatory out of apparently  Simple ndash the ILGA has signicant influence with the Scottish Government. Last week I knew of two Scottish organisations who were their members ndash Stonewall Scotland and LGBT Youth Scotland ndash both of whom are in receipt of signicant public funds.I now know that there are many Scottish organisations who are members of ILGA, including the Equality Network, Scottish Trans Alliance and over the last three years these organisations have been in receipt of pound. million of Scottish public funds.As ILGA stipulates that membership organisations sign up to all their aims, it is not unreasonable to question whether they were aware that the ILGA had signed up to this ldquomorally repugnant document.My position was and remains that organisations funded by our Government should have challenged this ndash and the Scottish Government needs to exercise due diligence on the matter.The ldquoScotland is Now campaign from Brand Scotland, a Scottish Government venture, states that the ILGArsquos vision ldquoaligns perfectly with Scotlandrsquos\".The Scottish Government are public about their dismay at losing the number one slot on the ILGArsquos index on LGBTI friendly governments to Malta. This may lie in the past failure of senior members of the government to unequivocally support gay rights when the rest of us did ndash and their determination not to be ldquoon the wrong side of history in future.Not content with just clarying positions, certain groups and other keyboard warriors have launched vicious personal attacks. I have been called transphobic and homophobic and been on the receiving end of threats of violence for raising legitimate concerns about placing the safeguarding of children at the heart of public policy making.One of my doughty defenders, Allison Bailey, wrote: ldquoLGBT+ organisations that have signed a declaration to lower the age of consent to ten years should face scrutiny.ldquoThis isnrsquot homophobic. LGBTQ+ organisations and their supporters who ignore red flags about child safeguarding and cry homophobia are helping to create the most dangerous climate for children. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people arenrsquot immoral. They donrsquot seek some opt out of basic values, including safeguarding.I couldnrsquot agree more. When it comes to safeguarding children, there are no free passes. To allow organisations or groups to be ldquobeyond reproach when it comes to protecting our children has dangerous precedents.N.B. Stonewall Scotland and LGBT Youth Scotland remain members of the ILGA, which has not ditched its commitment to the Feminist Declaration calling for the elimination of all laws relating to the age of consent for adolescents.

built between  and  for Mary Caroline, Duchess of Sutherland, the second we of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, rd Duke of Sutherland.The Duchess was better known as Duchess Blair, however, due to her first marriage to Captain Arthur Kindersely Blair of the st Highland Light Infantry, who died in a hunting accident in  near Pitlochry.Her marriage in  was not well received by the Sutherland family, and following the death of theDuke in  his will - which was in favour of the Duchess -was contested by his son, the th Duke.A court process followed, finding the Duchess guilty of destroying documents in attempt of securing the inheritance.She was imprisoned for six weeks in Holloway Prison, London.Eventually, the Sutherland family came to an agreement giving Duchess Blair a substantial financial settlement - as well as agreeing to build her a castle.The Duchess employed a firm of Ayrshire builders and got to work building Carbisdale Castle in .Because of the close location of the castle to her late husbands family, it was thought it was her deliberate attempt to spite the family.This is further supported by the fact the castles tower only features clocks on three of its four faces.The side facing Sutherland is blank,allegedly because the Duchess \"did not wish to give the time of day to her late husbands family.\"The castle was later bought by Colonel Theodore Salvesen, a wealthy Scottish businessman of Norwegian extractionin .He provided the castle as a safe refuge for King Haakon VII of Norway and Crown Prince Olav, who would become King Olav V, during the Nazi occupation of Norway in World War II.During that time, the castle was also used to hold important strategic meetings.King Haakon VII made an agreement at the Carbisdale Conference on  June  that the Russian forces, should they enter Norwegian territory, would not stay there after the war.Three years later, on  October , the Red Army entered Norway and captured  towns, but later withdrew according to the terms of the agreement.After the Colonel died his son, Captain Harold Salvesen, inherited the castle and gave its contents and estate to the Scottish Youth Hostels Association .Carbisdale Castle Youth Hostel opened to members on  June .The castle remained in the ownership of the SYHA until the costs of owning and maintaining the buildings and its contents became untenable and the castle was offered for sale, being purchased in  by its current owner.Amid a project toit to its former glory as a private residence, works have begun.However it will now be up to the lucky purchaser to complete the project \"in accordance with their own specications and intended future use of the property.\"Robert McCulloch, Head of Estates and Farms Agency in Scotland at Strutt  Parker said: \"Carbisdale Castle is an iconic building with really rich and notable history.\"The property today can be viewed as a lsquoblank canvasrsquo of almost , square feet of internal accommodation enabling a buyer to take the

For politicians, it is no easy ride. When I used to prepare Labour Party lists for Question Time outings, the planning was rigorous. What might the audience ask  How might dferent lists react Preparation was vital. Dozens of pages of briefing were produced every week. There was always an appreciation that one throwaway comment or angry exchange with an audience member could derail an election campaign or even a promising political career.:Nicola Sturgeon rejects claims shes running scared ahead of BBC Question TimeQuestion Time remains popular because it is one of the few places where political rhetoric comes into direct contact with voters, with very little mediation. Itrsquos one of the few places where polled and focus grouped lines get an immediate judgement from the public. It is a nerve-wracking high wire act for everyone involved.As Covid- has removed most of the possibility for spontaneous interactions between politicians and the public, phone ins and televised debates are one of the few places they can still happen.That might explain why Nicola Sturgeon is so reluctant to appear on tonightrsquos episode of Question Time. Every other party leader will be represented, but the SNP is sending their Deputy Leader.On the Question Time  tomorrow, Fiona is joined by @KeithBrownSNP, @DouglasMoray, @AnasSarwar, @lornaslater and @willie_rennie.With a virtual audience from Edinburgh, join us tomorrow at :pm on @BBCOne. #bbcqt pic TRQpqOzHAWhy  When you are flying so far ahead of your rivals in the polls, there really is little advantage to doing televised debates.When Nicola Sturgeon has faced one on one interviews, or the public, during this campaign, itrsquos often left her exposed.In the first debate, she faced hostile questions from the audience about independence. In recent interviews with Channel  and ITV, she admitted therersquos no up to date economic assessment of independence ndash quite the admission given that she wants an independent Scotland within the next five years. Ciaran Jenkins at Channel  News identied at the start of the campaign that the SNP leader was limiting her availability to journalists, with press officers refusing to say where the First Minister would be each day, presumably in an effort to exert greater control over the media narrative and avoid moments like this.For political leaders and their staff, that might make le easier. But for voters it leads to political campaigns removed of all spontaneity and reduced to a procession of  second clips on the evening news.Those around the First Minister probably think controlling her outings is doing her a favour, making her appear above the fray as the other political leaders fight it out for the runners up prizes.But for many others, it is a habit that will eventually make her look out of touch and distant from the people who she is asking for support. If yoursquore not willing to take questions from members of the public on Question Time, then what next :Salmond welcomes Ofcom probe into BBCs hostile Alba Party coverageItrsquos also a handbrake turn for a party that used to spend election campaigns asking for more time on air for their leaders, not less. Nicola Sturgeon used to demand her place in TV election debates and called out Theresa May when she avoided them in .No one will suggest that Nicola Sturgeon avoiding an episode of Question Time will cost her the electionbut it speaks to a much deeper tendency in the SNP to avoid scrutiny, to roll eyes at journalist who ask dficult questions and to dismiss challenging members of the public as ldquounionists.Perhaps itrsquos time for  Nicola Sturgeon to listen to  Nicola Sturgeonrsquos advice to the Prime Minister: ldquoIf [she] doesnrsquot have the confidence to debate her plans on TV with other leaders, broadcasters should empty chair her and go ahead anyway."},{"url":null,"title":"les-mckeown-bay-city-rollers-singer-remembered-stars","story":"The Scottish pop vocalist, known for his romantic lyrics and flamboyant fashion sense, was the frontman of the group during their s heyday.A statement from his family on Twitter said: ldquoIt is with profound sadness that we announce the death of our beloved husband and father Leslie Richard McKeown.

He stressed this is not an ordinary election and called for voters to \"choose something dferent.\"Anas Sarwar said Labour has plans to start the recovery immediately. He said there are ldquobillions of pounds accessible to spend on the economy: \"We cannot wait for the pandemic to end, I want to start spending that money now.Willie Rennie said Lib Dems would commit poundbn of extra spending to employ extra teachers, mental health services, the NHS and increasing social workers wages. \"Everything we promise is affordable and deliverable, we are not going to overpromise,\" he said.Lorna Slater said the Greens will have to see how willing the UK would be to work on a joint recoveryWillie Rennie criticised FM Nicola Sturgeon for \"taking her eye off the ball\" on drug deaths, and suggested a government focused on independence would not solve the health inequalities affecting Scotland.He focused on the countryrsquos ldquomental health problem and the need to train more experts ldquoto reduce the demand on the NHS.ldquoWeve got a mountain of mental health needs, wersquove got a mountain of people who are waiting for their operations, their appointments, he said.ldquoWeve got a mountain of mental health needs, wersquove got a mountain of people who are waiting for their operations, their appointments@willie_rennie says we need to focus on the countryrsquos ldquomental health problem and train more experts ldquoto reduce the demand on the NHS. #bbcqt pic NNTKVzyeW:Nicola Sturgeon: Why is First Minister not on BBC Question Time Quizzed about the smaller increase in funding promised by the SNP, compared to the UK Government, Keith Brown said the party had additional expenses allocated to mental health and disputed Westminsters numbers.Anas Sarwar said \"changing the way we do healthcare\" would be key in facing the issues brought by the pandemic. He pledged investment in social care, rapid diagnosis centres and mental health services.Douglas Ross said NHS staff have gone \"above and beyond over the last year\". When questioned on previously refusing to back a % increase in staff pay proposed by the SNP, he said he absolutely supports it: \"we have to support NHS and staff as the next year is still going to be dficult.\"Lorna Slater said \"alleviating poverty\" would be the priority to lt the pressure off the NHS and address issues like bed-blocking and chronic health problems caused by inequality.Lorna Slater took control of the debate around climate change. She said the decline of the oil and gas industry, while necessary, will not mean workers will be forgotten and they ldquowill be welcome to join the renewable sector.ldquoThe oil and gas industry will decline but that does not mean that we have to inflict hardship upon the people who work in that industry, she added.She stressed, unlike the SNP, the Greens are making the green recovery their first priority.She admitted that, even without independence, Greens would be able to do more to tackle the climate emergency.:SNP to miss majority at Holyrood election and support for Scottish independence dips, latest polls showPressed about a timeframe for decarbonising Scotland, SNPrsquos Keith Brown was unable to provide a target, while Douglas Ross also pledged to protect oil industry jobs.Anas Sarwar called for investment in renewable jobs as a first step in the transition. For Willie Rennie, the first step would be converting domestic supply to renewable energy to reduce demand of fossil fuel.Anas Sarwar called for taxes to be imposed on tech giants like Amazon, to redistribute to small businesses and revive the high street.Lorna Slater also underlined the need for taxing big corporations which would increase governmentrsquos income without taking money out of ordinary peoples pockets.Douglas Ross said: \"Scottish Conservatives plans are the most generous\". He pledged investments in the NHS, social housing, full-fibre broadband and the education and said he would \"love\" to give tax cutspossible."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : pmThe world#s most powerful tidal turbine, the Orbital O, is expected to arrive in Orkney over the weekend after being launched in Dundee earlier today.

Ten-metre blades give the O more than m of swept area to capture flowing tidal energy.The floating structure is held on station with a four-point mooring system where each mooring chain has the capacity to lt over  double decker buses.The O has been designed so that installation of the turbine, and all its associated moorings, can be carried out by low-cost work vessels and servicing can be carried out by RIB vessels — minimising downtime and lowering construction and operational costs.Electricity is transferred from the turbine via a dynamic cable to the seabed and a static cable along the seabed to the local onshore electricity network.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He ordered the campaign bus to be emblazoned with the disputed claim that leaving the EU would save pound million a week to spend on the NHS.Critics complained that the figure failed to take into account the funding the UK received back from Brussels, but Mr Cummings was only too well aware that the controversy simply served to highlight the sums Britain was sending the EU. vw,vw,px, px\"Benedict Cumberbatch played Dominic Cummings in a Channel  drama about Brexit He was credited with devising the ldquoTake back control slogan which was seen to capture the mood of disillusionment which helped drive the Brexit vote.And he was responsible also for a final online advertising blitz highlighting a potential influx of immigrants from TurkeyBritain remained in the EU, even though there was no imminent prospect of the country joining the bloc.He later wrote thatMr Gove and Boris Johnson, who were fronting the campaign, had not ldquopicked up the baseball bat marked lsquoTurkey NHS pound millionrsquo with five weeks to go the result could have gone the other way.Through it all, Mr Cummings made no secret of his contempt for the senior Tories on the Vote Leave board, complaining they would prefer to spend weekends off with their girlfriends than the hard business of campaigning.There was therefore consternation among many at Westminster when Mr Johnson became prime minister in July  and chose Mr Cummings to head up his No  operation.Whitehall was given an early taste of how he would operate when he fired Sonia Khan, a special adviser to then chancellor Sajid Javid, and had her marched out of Downing Street by an armed police officer for alleged leaks. vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings in Downing Street With Parliament deadlocked over Brexit, he was seen as the author of the plan to prorogue its sittings, subsequently ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, and the purge of the One Nation Tories who refused to back Mr Johnsonrsquos deal for leaving the EU.When the Prime Minister finally secured the general election he craved, it was Mr Cummings who came up with another simple but brutally effective slogan ndash ldquoGet Brexit done ndash which helped propel him to an -seat majority.With the Governmentrsquos position finally secure, Mr Cummings set about some of his pet projects, including an overhaul of the machinery of government, warning there was a ldquohard rain coming for Whitehall.A long-standing critic of what he regarded as the Oxbridge mentality which dominated the upper echelons of the civil service, he appealed for ldquoweirdos and misfits with odd skills to transform the way the country was run.He was certainly happy to cultivate the image of himself as the outsider, turning up to work in Downing Street in ill-fitting jeans and scruffy jumpers rather than traditional suit and tie.copy -.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/salmon_farmJPG-1.jpg","title":"region should be more than a playground for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhat is also very clear is that the impacts of the pandemic are extremely unequal, with the young having their prospects most severely impaired and those working in the private sector suffering the most severe economic consequences, yet to be felt in full, while the elderly and those with underlying health issues bearing the most risk to le, which has been tragic.Many people working in the front line have worked heroically. Of course, this includes those in the health service who have had to battle to save lives, but it also includes those who kept the boilers running, the ambulances and delivery vehicles on the road and the PPE arriving where required. That includes those in supply chains up and down the country, drivers, engineers, and tradesmen keeping our homes and critical facilities operational. It also includes those who have produced our food and those who distributed it and indeed those who kept the wheels and machinery of production and distribution of le’s essentials turning. Not least in the supply chain required to put food on our plates.A great many of our population, however — which is a blessing for them, whether wealthy, retired or working in the public sector or government, local or national — have neither had their economic situation nor their future employment prospects impaired, though of course, everyone has suffered the social deprivations and mental health challenges of lockdown. For those fortunate enough to be working in secure public sector employment or retired, perhaps on a secure pension, they do not have the financial concerns of those in the private sector whose jobs and livelihoods depend on viable economic activity.This imbalance of the bearing of the economic consequences of the pandemic is not given coverage or widely recognised, though our politicians at a national and local level are actively involved in formulating policy, actions, and funding programmes to sustain the economy and build back greener, better, and more fairly.Never has it been more critical for government at all levels, locally and nationally, to do everything possible to create and support sustainable jobs across our nation.We all have an obligation to recognise and understand this fundamental fact and do what we can to support economic growth and sustain people in, as well as create new jobs. The lack of a job, and the want of it, is fundamentally one of the most damaging situations to the long-term prospects, an inidual, their family and therefore society at large can suffer from.Economic growth and development,we are to sustain ourselves as a society, must be front and centre of government policy and action at national and local level. Local authorities and local politicians have a duty and an obligation too, not only to support development but make sure that they actively seek out and promote economic development opportunities within their areas of responsibility as a minimum. There needs to be some maturity in decision making and joined-up thinking in policy and action. You simply cannot have development without some impact, but neither can you have social progression without economic development.How can we call for building back our economy and protecting jobs, yet fail to support compliant job-creating planning applications  For example, the recent decision to refuse planning for an organic sea farm in Skye, which was recommended for approval, was in my view a dereliction of responsibility. It was to create nine new jobs directly. However, just the cancelling of the equipment orders required by this development and to be built here in the Highlands by our company, Gael Force Group, has caused the redundancy of over  people immediately and directly, just in this one company alone. This is a shocking narrowness in consideration and a failure of process and joined up thinking.We have become anti-development, anti-business in this country, yet we want all the benefits that depend on a strong, successful, and growing economy. It seems that we are prepared in this country now to tolerate someone dying from hunger and homelessness and the lack of a job, but not prepared to tolerate ‘our’ view or environment being altered. In the view of some people, all other forms of nature now have precedence over their fellow human beings. Like the clearances, once again the welfare of the local people who work the land and the sea is being considered as secondary to the narrow interests of a minority, often not rooted in the area, who care not for the economic wellbeing of other local people. We need to put people, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing first.The depressing familiarity of narrow interest groups’ objections to developments, often by an outspoken, sometimes fanatical, minority, often prejudiced on misinformation fuelled on social media but not supported by the scientic facts, is reaching a crisis across the Highlands and Islands and needs to be addressed. It requires local and national political leadership to speak out and stand up for the greater good, for the peoples of the Highlands and Islands welfare and livelihoods and retake the economic development agenda that has made the rural Highlands and Islands such a turnaround success over the past  to  years.If we do not see a change of behaviour in the support of development and growing the economy by all of us, we will be a failing nation, with rural areas becoming very largely inactive economically a playground for tourists, who are very welcome but who come and who go. A place again, where the will of the few suppress the opportunity of the many. If we do not change direction, we will leave no fine place, which in rural Scotland it should be, to raise a young family as our legacy. Shame on us."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MURAL-BIRCH-2.jpg","title":"donnie munro unveils sight for storr","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe landscape of the iconic island attraction is situated in Bayfield Road directly opposite Birch Cafe.The work was commissioned by Donnie’s son Niall who runs the coffee house.Niall said he wanted to bring an artistic flourish to the area for the enjoyment of both locals and visitors to the village., Niall Munro said: “The idea came about because the wall across from the cafe was in a total state of disrepair and there was a nice area that I thought was well suited for having a mural on it.“I mentioned it to my dad, but then didn’t really think much of it, but then I prompted him again and looked at it a bit more. He thought the landscape idea would be fitting.“We were thinking of locations and the Storr is quite an obvious one. We actually had an image of that particular view and thought that it would work really well.“It took a good few months to arrange because the wall belongs to Boots, so it took a bit of time to get the go ahead but we have got there.”He added: “From an arts point of view it is great to do something like this because it engages local interest as well as being for visitors.“It was very much just a way of brighting up the lane that we’re on anda by-product of it is that it benefits the other businesses here then great.”Like most business owners, Niall has experienced his fair share of obstacles due to the uncertainty brought by the pandemic. However, with Birch set to reopen at the end of April, he is excited about welcoming back customers with the cafe set to embark on a new venture.He said: “We are reopening at the end of the month and starting our own coffee roastery. We#ll start it on a small scale to begin with – by supplying Birch and a few other establishments on the island, and then a couple of months down the line I’ll open it up to online sales.“I have a passion for coffee and it is so much more exciting to be part of the whole process – from sourcing, importing, and now roasting, to then serving the final product.“It creates a much better story, and it is also an ethical way of doing it as we have direct links with the farmers that we are getting the coffee from.”Assessing the season ahead, he added: “It’s a mixed bag of feelings, it is dficult to have complete faith that this is the final lockdown – I think everybody needs to err on the side of caution and respect the rules that are in place.“The added benefit of Skye is that it is rural so there is lots of space for people to socially distance. And, thankfully, with the exception of Home Farm there hasn’t been any major outbreaks – and I think that was because people were being safe and able to be outdoors.“As long as people are following the rules then that’s the best we can do.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3758899.jpg--.jpg?1618997659000\n","title":"getting there a guide for first time visitors","story":"IF you want to try the Galboly Trail then be prepared for some stf climbs - and try and match your visit to a spell of dry weather.

Directions from Waterfoot: Turn towards Carnlough and drive along Coast Road.You will pass the ruins of the medieval church ruins at Ardclinis .Keep your speed down and look out for a silver gate with a steep path leading off the road.  On most occasions you will see a few vehicles parked at the side of the road.Try and give yourself a good line of sight as the road is often busy with traffic - and some of the road users simply fly round the bends.There is a simple opening mechanism on the gate so you don’t have to clamber over.Leave a donation in the ‘honesty box’ at the gateside - it’s the decent thing to show your appreciation to the landowner who has allowed people to trek across his land.Follow the obvious path taking time to snap a few pics on the way. You’ll probably need a few breaks because the climb is steady. As usual, follow the country code. Keep dogs on leash at all times and collect any litter.The steep trail into the hills begins beside the ‘Game of Thrones’ houses. You will see a small gate which is the start of the climb. After that it’s entirely up to you.Be aware: There is a proper layby about half a mile further on. It is opposite a silver gate with a path leading into the hills.

He added: Whilst the investigation is at an early stage, a strong line of inquiry is that this attack is the work of the New IRA.This was an explosive device designed to create a fireball. That fireball would have engulfed the car, anyone in it and in the proximity.First Minister Arlene Foster said yesterday dissident republican groups were currently attempting to attract new members in the north west and in her own Fermanagh-South Tyrone constituency.I do want to absolutely condemn the actions of these people, the DUP leader told the BBC.My local representatives in that area, and unfortunately in my own area, have watched as dissident republicans are seemingly trying to recruit at present.I say to all young people who may get caught up in the midst of this: think what could have happened to that young woman and her very young child and think of the consequences of that.Following a meeting of the Policing Board#s resources committee, Sinn Fein#s Gerry Kelly said members wished to record their abhorrence at the attack on this mother and her family, and welcome the strong messages of support and condemnation voiced across the community and from all political parties.He added the committee meeting had focused on the new PSNI People Strategy and plans to move forward with a range of recruitment competitions for officers and staff.

Stock image FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMary Lou McDonald. Stock imageApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UK’s Data Protection Commissioner is to begin making enquiries into Sinn Fein’s secret voter database.The Information Commissioner’s Officeis expected to seek information from Mary Lou McDonald’s party after details of Sinn Fein’s Abu system were revealed by Independent.ie.DUP East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson said he’s made an appeal to the ICO to investigate amid concerns the database would contain details of Northern Ireland voters. He said a full audit should be carried out of Sinn Fein’s operations in Northern Irelandnecessary. I am very concerned about this story which seems to bounce between Serbia, Germany, USA, NI and RoI. The only place missing is Timbuktu,” he said. “I have raised these concerns with the ICO and on Monday they confirmed receipt of my request for an investigation to ensure all data is being handled appropriately.”It comes as Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner is continuing to seek answers from Sinn Fein about the party’s database of Irish voters’ names, addresses and perceived voting intentions which are stored in Frankfurt, Germany. The personal information was moved from London to the German city after Brexit.In a statement, the ICO said: “We are aware of reports regarding a database operated by Sinn Fein and we will be making enquiries.“Advice on the use of personal information by political parties, including the use of profiling techniques, is available on our website,” a spokesperson added.The statement also included a link to UK rules on political profiling which includes the need for parties to have clearly stated policy informing iniduals that they are carrying out profiling on them.“This is particularly importantyou are profiling iniduals who have had no contact with you, such as members of the public who you are trying to understand,” it says.Read MoreMary Lou McDonald denies wrongdoing over party voter databaseThe ICO’s website says profiling is often “not well understood” and when carried out in a political context can be “disconcertingpeople do not fully understand what it entails and how it is used”. “Don’t collect too much information or keep it for too long. Just because your systems allow you to retain vast quantities of data doesn’t mean you should,” it adds.Independent.ie revealed Sinn Fein activists were trained to elicit information from Facebook users which could be cross-referenced with their Abu system to “pinpoint” homes addresses of potential voters.Other internal Sinn Fein training documents shows party members were told Abu “records multiple contacts” and that the database will be used “to present info dferently in time”.Party members were also told Abu “provides for a practical recording of the very and engagement phases as well as the identy stage” of Sinn Fein’s interactions with voters.Sinn Fein has refused to answer questions about their internal training for Abu but have said they are “fully compliant” with data protection legislation.It comes after Mary Lou McDonald revealed Sinn Fein transferred millions of Irish voters’ personal data to London before moving the information to Germany after Brexit.Since details of the party’s Abu system emerged, a string of Sinn Fein TDs refused to reveal where they were storing the data. Cavan-Monaghan TD Matt Carthy even said he could not reveal where it was because it was an “IT related question”.However, after being repeatedly questioned on Newstalk, Ms McDonald finally said she had “no problem” saying where the information is being held.“It had been stored in London, but obviously Brexit happened and that distributed that so it is legally held and stored in the EU as per the law,” Ms McDonald said.When asked why an Irish political party would not store the information in Ireland, Ms McDonald said “that’s a technical question”.“It doesn’t really matter as long as it’s held in the European Union – we would not be alone in making use of the services of people who are not in Ireland,” said Ms McDonald, but did not say which other parties are storing voter information in other countries.Independent.ieMost ReadMan shot by police in Derry is attempted murder suspectDundonald woman Emma Green stole £k from firm in  yearsHow retired Enniskillen couple#s dream bathroom became a £k nightmareMagheramorne Estate mansion transformed into wedding venue with  jobs createdSvetlana Murphyfound #safe and well# in Belfast as manarrested Top VideosPlayWhat you can do as restrictions ease in Northern Ireland on Friday April .

He ordered the campaign bus to be emblazoned with the disputed claim that leaving the EU would save £ million a week to spend on the NHS.Critics complained that the figure failed to take into account the funding the UK received back from Brussels, but Mr Cummings was only too well aware that the controversy simply served to highlight the sums Britain was sending the EU.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk eacb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-bf--bd-aacacf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk eacb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-bf--bd-aacacf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk eacb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-bf--bd-aacacf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk eacb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-bf--bd-aacacf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Benedict Cumberbatch played Dominic Cummings in a Channel  drama about Brexit PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBenedict Cumberbatch played Dominic Cummings in a Channel  drama about Brexit He was credited with devising the “Take back control” slogan which was seen to capture the mood of disillusionment which helped drive the Brexit vote.And he was responsible also for a final online advertising blitz highlighting a potential influx of immigrants from TurkeyBritain remained in the EU, even though there was no imminent prospect of the country joining the bloc.He later wrote thatMr Gove and Boris Johnson, who were fronting the campaign, had not “picked up the baseball bat marked ‘Turkey NHS £ million’ with five weeks to go” the result could have gone the other way.Through it all, Mr Cummings made no secret of his contempt for the senior Tories on the Vote Leave board, complaining they would prefer to spend weekends off with their girlfriends than the hard business of campaigning.There was therefore consternation among many at Westminster when Mr Johnson became prime minister in July  and chose Mr Cummings to head up his No  operation.Whitehall was given an early taste of how he would operate when he fired Sonia Khan, a special adviser to then chancellor Sajid Javid, and had her marched out of Downing Street by an armed police officer for alleged leaks.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fe .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_d-bf--bd-aacacf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fe .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_d-bf--bd-aacacf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fe .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_d-bf--bd-aacacf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fe .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_d-bf--bd-aacacf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Dominic Cummings in Downing Street PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDominic Cummings in Downing Street With Parliament deadlocked over Brexit, he was seen as the author of the plan to prorogue its sittings, subsequently ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, and the purge of the One Nation Tories who refused to back Mr Johnson’s deal for leaving the EU.When the Prime Minister finally secured the general election he craved, it was Mr Cummings who came up with another simple but brutally effective slogan – “Get Brexit done” – which helped propel him to an -seat majority.With the Government’s position finally secure, Mr Cummings set about some of his pet projects, including an overhaul of the machinery of government, warning there was a “hard rain” coming for Whitehall.A long-standing critic of what he regarded as the Oxbridge mentality which dominated the upper echelons of the civil service, he appealed for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to transform the way the country was run.He was certainly happy to cultivate the image of himself as the outsider, turning up to work in Downing Street in ill-fitting jeans and scruffy jumpers rather than traditional suit and tie.PAMost ReadMan shot by police in Derry is attempted murder suspectDundonald woman Emma Green stole £k from firm in  yearsHow retired Enniskillen couple#s dream bathroom became a £k nightmareMagheramorne Estate mansion transformed into wedding venue with  jobs createdSvetlana Murphyfound #safe and well# in Belfast as manarrested Top VideosPlayWhat you can do as restrictions ease in Northern Ireland on Friday April .

If approved an additional  plots will be created at the local graveyard. For many years concerns have been raised that the City Cemetery has been running out of burial space. Derry City and Strabane District Council, which manages the cemetery, have lodged a planning application in recent days for the extension proposals. The Derry News has seen confidential documents from a special meeting of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s Environment and Regeneration Committee held on Tuesday to discuss the plans. googletag.cmd.push A report was presented to councillors detailing plans to expand the existing City Cemetery on to adjoining lands at Southway. The plans include a new road into the cemetery off the lower end of the Southway road .  It has also emerged that a portion of the lands could be made available for social housing. Council officers estimate that the expansion will cost pound.m. The earmarked wooded area is presently owned by the Northern Ireland Housing Executivewhich leases it to the Woodland Trust. Council officers previously explored the possibility of expanding it in two parts. An initial assessment indicated that , additional plots could be accommodated. googletag.cmd.push The larger part of the works were to be sited on the high ground below Kildrum Gardens where , plots would have been situated. The smaller area on low land opposite Lone Moor Gardens – where the new entrance will be made – was to accommodate  plots. However, as detailed plans were drawn up it emerged that the lower site was unsuitable because of engineering costs and the inability to meet inclusive standards for pathways. Furthermore, the document states that the number of plots that could be accommodated would be signicantly reduced by site works and drainage systems and the presence of red squirrels and badgers may have led to planning issues.     Development of the lower cemetery site opposite Lone Moor Gardens was therefore ruled out. But for health and safety reasons officers recommended approving the new access road. According to the report, the approved upper Kildrum site will have space for approximately  plots. It could extend the lespan of the existing cemetery for between five and seven years, dependent on future burial rates, it adds. Local residents were assured that the new access road will provide around  parking spaces for residents or visitors. Council officers also attempted to assuage the concerns around fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour which have caused problems for residents in the past. NEW SITE Part of the rationale behind the expansion is to allow the local council to find a suitable site for a new cemetery. Since the late s the local council has been reviewing the lespan of the cemetery and as such decided to research potential new sites. It sought expressions of interest from landowners who were willing to sell land on two occasions during  but nobody came forward. A third advertisement in  generated four expressions of interest at Coney Road in Culmore, lands adjoining the old Killea Cemetery, lands at Nixon’s Corner and near Braehead Road. The preferred site at Killea was ruled out as the cost was deemed too high. Lands close to Nixon’s Corner are now viewed as the most realistic option.

The past year has been one of the toughest ever experienced by business owners with a number of high-street giants collapsing and others on the brink. NI is in the midst of a recession, but the outlook isn’t all bleak. A number of iniduals have taken the brave step of opening new premises. They are optimistic about the future and keen to show that independent businesses can still thrive. Springing up across the town are a new hairdressing salon, an ice-cream parlour and a menswear shop. googletag.cmd.push Between them they have experience, an intimate knowledge of their fields and youthful exuberance. The Derry News spoke to three small-business owners who are setting up shop as we emerge from the biggest global pandemic in a century. In their own way they are each defying the odds.  Paul Martin Menswear Co., Greenhaw Road  Owner Paul Cooleyhas overcome health issues in the past year when, along with his we, he was hospitalised after contracting Covid-. Although the idea of opening his own business has been brewing for some time, the family’s health scare accelerated those plans. googletag.cmd.push “My experiences during the pandemic have definitely given me the courage to go and achieve any dreams that I had,” he says. “Myself and my we were extremely unwell due to Covid. I spent a period of time in the High Dependency Unitat Altnagelvin. “I can see the devastation that the pandemic has caused and it would bring a tear to your eye. “We owe everything to the staff at the hospital, there were times that it looked very dark, but they pushed me on and got me back on my feet.” With conviction, he continues: “I can’t have any more regrets, le is very short and the last year has taught us that.     “You need to grab it with both hands and try to achieve your dreams.” Paul’s family history is steeped in the menswear industry. His grandfather owned Fitzpatrick Sports, his father Martin – who is honoured in the shop name - had a long successful retail career at Austin’s department store, Burton’s menswear and Topshop. Following in their footsteps, Paul has worked in retail for  years in stores including Yellow Moon and CityMan – where he spent the past  years. He says: “Retail and menswear is all we have known in my family. Hopefully now the time is right to put my experiences I’ve learnt from my family and retailers I have worked for into practice to benefit my own business.” The store will cater for young cutting-edge fashion and the older discerning gentleman with an emphasis on local suppliers. “We’re delighted to announce that we’ll be working alongside former Irish rugby player Tommy Bowe. We’ll be the official stockist of his clothing range XV Kings.” Paul will also be venturing into the wedding market to offer affordable packages. The store will open as soon as non- essential retail restrictions are lted on April . “We’ll go full throttle, try our very best and look forward to welcoming the public,” he concludes.  Donna VIP - Hair  Beauty Studio, Carlisle Road  “We’re opening now on Friday, I’m buzzing, it’s so great to be back into the swing of things,” says Donna Wilson Scott Hegarty. The Derry woman has been immersed in the hairdressing industry for  years. For her, the pandemic acted as an opportunity to reset. As project manager she has endeavoured to see the salon of her dreams come to fruition. “The design is all based on legendary Hollywood females, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly…it’s looking really lovely, very glam and something that’s never really been touched upon in Derry,” an upbeat Donna explains. “I have another unit underneath that I’m looking to develop into a beauticians but that will be further down the line.” Donna is eager to get back to work for her own mental well-being and that of her loyal clients. “Hairdressers and beauticians should’ve been seen as part of essential services for people’s mental health because I have seen how important it is to my customers,” she says. The Derry woman recognised that it has been a ‘tough’ year for colleagues and all workers in close contact industries. For now, staff and customers will have to adhere to Covid safety measures but in time she is hopeful of ato normality. Donna says: “I’m just hoping that with the rollout of the vaccine, everybody gets back on their feet and we can lose a couple of restrictions in the salon. “Because you want to be able to offer refreshments, that’s all part of the hairdressing experience. “People need to see a light at the end of the tunnel.” The businesswoman has been inundated with appointments for over  clients from Derry, Donegal and further afield. She is fully booked until the end of May. She adds: “When people come in I like it to feel like a breath of fresh air. It’s not just about a hair cut and colour, they’re getting a nice ambience and I want them to leave feeling good about themselves and uplted.”  ANDIAMO, Spencer Road  The business name translates as, ‘Let’s Go’, in Italian. Omagh native Rory McLaughlin opened his doors on April  and is eager to welcome the wider Derry public into his shop. He is a bespoke artisan ice-cream manufacturer who has trained at Loughry Campus – a College which educates students to ensure they meet the needs of the food industry. Rory then spent a year in New Zealand milking cows. He therefore knows the meaning of the gastronomic phrase, ‘from field to fork’…or spoon in his case. Experience gained as a sales and promotions manager for an ice cream manufacturer in Newtownards will also stand him in good stead. “Within that role I was making it, putting it in the freezer, taking it out and putting it into a freezer van and delivering it. The whole lot including marketing and social media,” he explains. The -year-old has been welcomed by his neighbours on Spencer Road, including Nonna’s who greeted him with a freshly baked pizza. His vision is for customers to be able to see ice cream being made in shop. “With a few years of experience, having milked cows, tried dferent ieties, I’m keen to show people my own style of ice cream,” he says. He is however aware that everyone has their own tastes as evidenced by the popularity of bubblegum ice cream with customers young and old. “What I very much like to make is something that is local, Irish made. Where possible manufactured with raw materials that are coming from the island – a local artisan ice cream that is made in front of your eyes.” Research has given Rory confidence that he can make the business a success. “I do think there is a space in the market for a price-competitive artisan, zero food miles product. “My own lot think I’m mad because I’m doing a part-time Master’s degree. “People are while happy to see something independent opening on Spencer Road.” Rory has exciting plans mapped out for the future which will be revealed in due course. With that new customers arrived at the door and he was off to treat them to some hand-made ice cream.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The whole lot including marketing and social media,” he explains. The -year-old has been welcomed by his neighbours on Spencer Road, including Nonna’s who greeted him with a freshly baked pizza. His vision is for customers to be able to see ice cream being made in shop. “With a few years of experience, having milked cows, tried dferent ieties, I’m keen to show people my own style of ice cream,” he says. He is however aware that everyone has their own tastes as evidenced by the popularity of bubblegum ice cream with customers young and old. “What I very much like to make is something that is local, Irish made. Where possible manufactured with raw materials that are coming from the island – a local artisan ice cream that is made in front of your eyes.” Research has given Rory confidence that he can make the business a success. “I do think there is a space in the market for a price-competitive artisan, zero food miles product. “My own lot think I’m mad because I’m doing a part-time Master’s degree. “People are while happy to see something independent opening on Spencer Road.” Rory has exciting plans mapped out for the future which will be revealed in due course. With that new customers arrived at the door and he was off to treat them to some hand-made ice cream.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was very generous to me and gave me a couple of hours work experience in the office and it kind of went from there. Unfortunately David passed away in  and he left my name with the electoral office to become the MLA for East Londonderry, so thats where it came from.  LT: How did that feel when someone like David McClarty, who you looked up to, left your name as his successor  googletag.cmd.push CS: I had mixed emotions around it. David was a wonderful man and the community really got behind him after that happened. It was a huge honour when, after his passing, he had given me that role. Equally, it was daunting and I didnt have him there to guide me and mentor me through it. I always wonder what he would have made of the last seven years with me as his successor. I hope Ive made him proud.  LT: You mentioned about helping people. What has been your most proud achievement in that sense  CS: Prior to me becoming Minister, despite having over , incidents of domestic abuse across Northern Ireland every year, no one had ever tackled it. googletag.cmd.push I made it my mission that we would get a conversation started around it, and that led to the piece of legislation that my successor has been able to make into law now. If this all ended tomorrow, thats what I would take away from it.  LT: Did it frustrate you how your time as Justice Minister came to an end with the Assembly unravelling  CS: It was disappointing, because I feel that government of Sinn Feacutein, DUP and myself was one that had the opportunity to transform Northern Ireland. Certainly the conversations we were having around the Executive table before it all fell apart were the most positive, I understand, ever.     We had created a new approach in Northern Ireland where we were looking at outcomes. I really hope people start to realise what our job is, and vote for people on that basis.  LT: It had been rumoured at the time you had considered quitting politics. How close were you to doing that  CS:  was probably the worst because I really did think wed moved on, and it made me reconsiderit was something I wanted to continue in. Ive had those feelings even since then, because we had three horric years where politicians in particular parties were not being responsible to the people who voted for them. The only reason I continue to do this job is to help people and try and progress things for them, andI cant do that it would make me consider whether it was worth it. Its my job to help people, and most people are really kind and generous. Thats what I focus on and what keeps me going.  LT: Over the last while there has been violence and protests in the area. How do you try and calm the situation as a local MLA  CS: I watched the behaviour unfold and its sad to see it does seem to be young people. They are being exploited by potentially more sinister elements within the community. Kids will look for opportunities, andthey arent there, and someone  is providing them in the form of paramilitarism, that might be a better option for them. Its no coincidence the unrest is happening in socially deprived areas and we need to get back to building them up again and not allowing paramilitaries to manipulate them. Recent violence in Coleraine. LT: How important are independent voices in Northern Ireland politics  CS: Often people would criticise me and ask what one MLA in  do, but in my seven years as MLA I have demonstrated I have had an impact. There is almost something more honest about independents, andwe need more of anything in politics at the minute, its honesty. I dont have to refer my opinion to someone, I can just have a very considered approach myself. If anyone compliments me, they say they appreciate my honesty and candour.  LT: Youve mentioned female voices. Three of the current party leaders are women. How would you assess the current position  CS: The Assembly needs to be representative of the people of Northern Ireland, so% of the population are women, then we need to have % of MLAs as women as well. The Assembly, in fairness, has come great strides in terms of that representation, because we have more female MLAs than weve ever had. But we need more, and I would encourage any women, particularly young women, who are thinking about this to consider getting involved and having a voice. It probably means them joining a party, but be the change you want to see.  LT: Is there anything in particular youre hoping to see done in the remainder of the Assembly term  CS: Im working on a piece of legislation around trauma. Its a fact of le, whether its a car accident or have a traumatic birthing experience. Mainly in Northern Ireland, our trauma comes from the conflict, and we have this generation in their s and s now who were traumatised by conflict and weve never dealt with that. Were now seeing that manesting in mental health issues, and its no coincidence we have some of the most signicant mental health issues across these islands. I would like to develop a piece of policy or legislation that stops people being re-traumatised. I think it opens up that conversation about how we address the conflict.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was very generous to me and gave me a couple of hours work experience in the office and it kind of went from there. Unfortunately David passed away in  and he left my name with the electoral office to become the MLA for East Londonderry, so thats where it came from.  LT: How did that feel when someone like David McClarty, who you looked up to, left your name as his successor  googletag.cmd.push CS: I had mixed emotions around it. David was a wonderful man and the community really got behind him after that happened. It was a huge honour when, after his passing, he had given me that role. Equally, it was daunting and I didnt have him there to guide me and mentor me through it. I always wonder what he would have made of the last seven years with me as his successor. I hope Ive made him proud.  LT: You mentioned about helping people. What has been your most proud achievement in that sense  CS: Prior to me becoming Minister, despite having over , incidents of domestic abuse across Northern Ireland every year, no one had ever tackled it. googletag.cmd.push I made it my mission that we would get a conversation started around it, and that led to the piece of legislation that my successor has been able to make into law now. If this all ended tomorrow, thats what I would take away from it.  LT: Did it frustrate you how your time as Justice Minister came to an end with the Assembly unravelling  CS: It was disappointing, because I feel that government of Sinn Feacutein, DUP and myself was one that had the opportunity to transform Northern Ireland. Certainly the conversations we were having around the Executive table before it all fell apart were the most positive, I understand, ever.     We had created a new approach in Northern Ireland where we were looking at outcomes. I really hope people start to realise what our job is, and vote for people on that basis.  LT: It had been rumoured at the time you had considered quitting politics. How close were you to doing that  CS:  was probably the worst because I really did think wed moved on, and it made me reconsiderit was something I wanted to continue in. Ive had those feelings even since then, because we had three horric years where politicians in particular parties were not being responsible to the people who voted for them. The only reason I continue to do this job is to help people and try and progress things for them, andI cant do that it would make me consider whether it was worth it. Its my job to help people, and most people are really kind and generous. Thats what I focus on and what keeps me going.  LT: Over the last while there has been violence and protests in the area. How do you try and calm the situation as a local MLA  CS: I watched the behaviour unfold and its sad to see it does seem to be young people. They are being exploited by potentially more sinister elements within the community. Kids will look for opportunities, andthey arent there, and someone  is providing them in the form of paramilitarism, that might be a better option for them.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Applications were recently made for new Irish street signs at Ballynagard Crescent and Hatmore Park. Once an application is made to Derry City and Strabane District Council, the council then writes to the residents in the streets to find out their views on the street sign application.

In January of this year, the council agreed to reduce this threshold to %. googletag.cmd.push However, the applications for new street signs at Ballynagard Crescent and Hatmore Park were all based on the previous threshold. In relation to Ballynagard Crescent, a total of  households were contacted in relation to the application. Of these households,  responded to the council and % of them were in support of the new street sign being erected. However, because this did not meet the current threshold of %, the proposed new road sign will not be installed. At Hatmore Park,  households were contacted by the council.

Moneymore Nursery Unit was founded in  in partnership with St Patricks Primary School, the areas Catholic maintained primary school, and the controlled Moneymore Primary School. However, in , the nursery unit removed St Patricks PS from its original admissions criteria, a move parents claim which makes it more dficult for children hoping to attend St Patricks to access local nursery provision. Terry ONeill, who had three of his children denied a place in the nursery due to the criteria, says agreement had been reached in  for the nursery to reflect a cross-community ethos. googletag.cmd.push “Moneymores play group was originally in the Catholic parish hall,” he said. “When it was moved up to the Protestant ground, it was agreed to have a dferent unorm, crest and entrance into the nursery. It meant it felt more neutral.” The Moneymore man has contacted the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young Peoplefor assistance. In correspondence with NICCY, seen by the County Derry Post, the Education Authoritysaid the nurserys current admissions criteria is at odds with its original intent. “The Education Authorityacknowledges your observation that the original purported intent of Moneymore Nursery School i.e. integrated provider of education in Moneymore appears inconsistent with the current schools admissions criteria, and this has been the case since   academic year,” they said. googletag.cmd.push “As you will be a aware legislative responsibility for determining admissions criteria rests with eachinidual school Board of Governors and is outwith the responsibility of EA. “Consequently EA has no role in establishing or amending inidual schools’ admissions criteriaand neither does EA have the legislative authority to challenge an inidual schools’ admissions criteria.” A response from Moneymore Nursery Unit is also included within the correspondence, where the unit say they have always been connected to Moneymore PS. “Moneymore Nursery Unit has always been a unit connected to Moneymore Primary School,” they said. “The criteria for the Nursery Unit are reviewed annually and in most years amendments are made.     “The Nursery Unit is often oversubscribed so the governors take account of a number of factors when reviewing and amending the criteria.” The primary schools are paired for the Shared Education programme and interact under activities related to it. Northern Irelands Childrens Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma said the current situation allows schools to drt from their original mission and that government should instruct, rather than advise, Boards of Governors. “School Admissions Policy, across Northern Ireland, is an issue which we monitor on an ongoing basis,” she said. “I am concerned, as Board of Governors ultimately have responsibility to set these in their respective schools, that many schools ‘drt’ from their original mission. “That is why we must reform when the Department of Education ‘instructs’ rather than ‘advises’ Boards of Governors. “I will continue to recommend the Department moves to instruct Boards of Governors in unorm policies, relationship and sexual education, restrictive practices and of course admissions policies. “The importance of the latter has been demonstrated by the recent challenges posed by the transfer test.” The County Derry Post contacted Moneymore Nursery Unit for further comment, but did not receive a reply.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the start of the campaign we got beat - by Norway and we didnrsquot even bat an eyelid at it we just kept going.ldquoWhen we beat Belarus - we were down to ten players and I think thatrsquos when we started to realise that we could make it happen.Perry started her career at Ballynahinch Youth before moving to Linfield and eventually getting her move across the water to Blackburn Rovers and now Forfar Farmington.The shot-stopper spoke about what qualying for the Euros will do to the future generation of Northern Irish players.We really want to inspire the next generation and make it possible for any girl to go and pick up a pair of football boots or a football shirt and go out to play, that was the main thing for us, she said.ldquoBut even in terms of the older players that are maybe towards the end of their career, to be role models for the younger ones coming through is just great to see.Northern Ireland are the second smallest nation to qualy for the Womenrsquos Euros with Iceland being the first. Many of the Northern Irish players playing in the local Irish League have only had just one match since December, which was against England in February.ldquoWe have a lot of players that go and do their nine to five jobs and then come to training, theyrsquove dedicated themselves to that, said Perry.ldquoEspecially the older ones, as for the younger ones like myself wersquore pushing through and hopefully get across the water, she added.ldquoThe league in Northern Ireland is good but itrsquos not as competitive as the league here in Scotland or in England.Perry has been a consistent performer for Forfar Farmington since signing from Rovers and she hopes to be rejoining the National team for next yearrsquos Euros.ldquoI need to keep doing what I am doing.

We are a lot more confident on the ball, beforehand we would have just kicked it up the pitch and get a two second breather and wersquore back to defending said the Ballynahinch goalkeeper.ldquoBut now wersquore just so confident and everyone is enjoying their football. Alfie Wylie did great things for the team but I think Kenny coming in has just freshened it up and it gave everyone that sense of we can achieve something she added.On Friday it was announced that Northern Ireland had moved up to th in the FIFA World rankings which is the highest theyrsquove ever been.The delighted Perry said: ldquoItrsquos massive for Northern Ireland, we beat Ukraine by a good gap overall as it was - but they were th or something like that ranked.ldquoSo just beating teams like that just shows how we are progressing and I think now itrsquos what we deserve and hopefully over the coming years we can progress she added.Northern Ireland have played their games at Seaview, home of Crusaders, for the last few years, but following the qualication it was mentioned about Windsor Park being the venue for future fixtures.ldquoIrsquove played at Windsor Park once and itrsquos so big. Seaview probably suits us better and it saves our legs said Perry.ldquoWindsor Park is the home of Northern Ireland football and it would mean a lot for the girls who havenrsquot played there to eventually step on that pitch and get a game representing their country on the pitch that the men play on.Shiels recently commented the win was the best sporting achievement in UK history due to the fact amateur players had beaten professionals throughout the game.ldquoItrsquos a huge statement to come out with but I think part of it is true because nobody would ever have expected little Northern Ireland to qualy for the Euros said Perry.ldquoNobody would have have looked at us before and said that we are going to qualy.

I had been told it was good for anxiety which I have struggled with, so I thought I may try it myself, said Lorna.ldquoOnce I tried it for the first time, I was hooked. It sends sensations up your body and brings an overwhelming sense of calmness to you. Itrsquos a complete form of tranquility.Cold water swimming has been reported to help people who struggle with depression and anxiety as well as slowing down the onset of dementia and help with the effects of menopause. It also has been reported to increase happiness, give your body better circulation and to help build your immune system.Although an advocate for cold water, Lorna also stressed the importance of safe swimming, especially when the temperature s to near freezing.ldquoItrsquos a good place to be when yoursquore in the water. I think the colder it is then the more benefit you get from it, she said. ldquoHowever, you obviously have to be careful when yoursquore going in, especially during harsher weather you have to limit your time.ldquoIf you go into it and yoursquore not used to having your breathing under control, your body can go into an uncontrollable shock. Start slowly and get your body into control. Irsquove seen people walk in and run out again almost immediately, but once you get used to the process you just feel happy, calm and relaxed and you want to stay in longer.After stressing iables which must be taken into account before hitting the waters, Lorna also lists some essential tips for beginners thinking of giving it a try.ldquoAlways take someone with you in case something goes wrong. Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock.

He and his we, Agnes, began to hold services in Downpatrick and surrounding neighbourhood, preaching, holding society meetings and administering the sacraments.He went on to build a Methodist preaching house in the town, personally raising funds, obtaining a suitable site and even joining in manual labour to ensure its completion.He conducted the opening service on November , , at Scotch Street and he and his family moved into an adjoining small room, which for many years afterwards served to accommodate preachers appointed to the town.It was decided in  to replace the original building with a new one on the same site. The result was the present building which was opened in April  at a cost of pound,.The congregation at the time decided to use chairs rather than pews in their new worship centre so that the building could be used for youth work and other activities during the week.In , the congregation completed an extension to the building in the form of a new kitchen and toilet facilities as well as a large upper room for youth work and other community activities. The cost of was pound, all of which was met by the local congregation.Whilst the Methodist congregation in Downpatrick has always been relatively small it has nevertheless made enormous contributions to religious, civil, and civic le in the town and surrounding area.There are strong ecumenical relations dating back to its inception as a church body. The congregation has endeavoured to work alongside denominations and the church was used as a refreshment point on the annual St Patrickrsquos Day pilgrimage from Saul to Down Cathedral where pilgrims were treated to a potted history of Methodism by Dr Brian Turner.The congregation also hosted well renowned annual lectures by visiting speakers including Baroness Blood and the distinguished author and journalist Alf McCreary, among others. In more recent years the dwindling congregation began to consider its future as part of the Dundrum, Newcastle and Downpatrick Methodist Circuit.All three congregations have suffered losses over the last two decades and it was time to consider how the Methodist community in southeast Down might look in the future.In January of  following several discussions with all three congregations the Circuit Council took the dficult decision to close Downpatrick and Dundrum Methodist Churches and consolidate as one congregation under the new name of Donard Methodist Church which meets in the Newcastle Methodist Church building.The Rev Mervyn Ewing, circuit minister, said: ldquoClosing a church is a huge and dficult decision to make which members of the Circuit Council did not make lightly.ldquoIt is important to note the considerable sacrices that were made over the years by the Downpatrick people who were committed and devoted to God, one another and their church.ldquoWe are very conscious of the emotional cost this decision has exacted on the devoted congregation. As Christians we believe firmly in resurrection for something new to grow and flourish there must be death.ldquoAs Methodists, building on all that has been before and what we have learned from one another and God, we forge ahead believing that in the lsquoNew Thingrsquo God creates there will be le and energy to stay true to our Methodist calling.Since the present Downpatrick Methodist Church was opened in  the ministers in charge have been as follows:, John McCaffrey, BA , John Hart , William E.

I watched the tall athletic figureballs with a hard bat, as they were known, while most in the club were playing with the new sponge covered weapons. I immediately decided that was the type of style and bat I wanted to play with.It was an exciting time in the club for young hopefuls eager to impress the boss, Leslie Sullivan, and get a place in of the three teams competing in the league. When I was eventually told that I would be playing in the A team away to St Maryrsquos, Newcastle, and partnering Noel in the doubles I was so excited that I practiced every night in preparation for the match which we won and then had to thumb a lt home.It was the start of a long tournament doubles partnership. We may not have been the most successful mdash our styles were too similar for that mdash but we certainly made the opposition work for every point.By the late s reverse bats, as they were known, were now the preferred option for most players, but Noelrsquos long range chopped defence suited the pimpled bat known as the lsquoBarnarsquo, named after  times world champion Victor Barna, and the perfect foil toto loop drives created by the new sponge revolution.The matches between Noel and his attacking opponents were a joy to watch and earned him the nickname Chopper. But soon new defensive products arrived, making Noel an even a more dficult player to contend with and resulted in him winning inidual trophies.Opponents who had played him previously knew what to expect and those who didnrsquot soon realised that they had to earn every point as the ball kept coming back mixed with the occasional well-judged forehand kill. All his matches were the same mdash succeed or fail, no quarter asked for and certainly none given.Noel Breen leaves behind a legacy of loyalty and dedication to the sport of table tennis.Always among the first to enter the leaguersquos charity events, he gave up his time to coach the Downpatrick Special Olympics team to compete in the league and helped other clubs in the district when they needed players.But it was at the Strangford club where he started and ended a long and distinguished service as a player and committee member. Whenever he was needed he was always available. He put up tables for competitions, made iders to separate tables and even secured sponsorship from local businesses to pay for the materials.A few years ago he told me he was advised to retire due to health issues. But following a short rest period he ed to support the club due to falling membership. Once a table tennis player always a table tennis player.His passing leaves another void in the golden years of the Lecale League. His affable personality endeared him to all who knew him, as evidenced by the numerous comments posted on social media sites following the news of his death.One especially from Martin Pickles is worthy of mention. He posted that Noel was a great competitor and played a good game of table tennis mdash high praise indeed from the master of defence, and a perfect epitaph to conclude this tribute to my good friend and mentor.

However, that is not going to happen given the update provided by the government department last night.The roads minister said the important project will deliver a bypass that will ldquosignicantly reduce traffic in the centre of Ballynahinch and improve journey time reliability and safety on the main Belfast to Newcastle Road.In addition to making a direction order, Mrs Mallon has confirmed that her department is currently exploring further opportunities to improve Ballynahinch town centre to create a ldquosustainable, liveable place where people have the space to stay, meet, shop and safely walk, wheel and cycle.She explained this will include opportunities for active and sustainable travel in the town including a new footway cycleway and a park and share facility along the route of the bypass.ldquoWe have a real opportunity to seize this chance for change and build back better together for our local communities, the roads minister declared. ldquoAs Minister, Irsquom committed to making progress in Ballynahinch and right across the North.ldquoThis is a positive step forward for the local community who have waited many years for progress on the Ballynahinch bypass and moving forward with it is part of my plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.Confirmation of the direction order comes after roads officials released a computer generated image on the Department for Infrastructure website which provides an aerial fly-through of the new road scheme, beginning at the Newcastle Road end.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Roads officials insist that the Ballynahinch scheme will reduce journey times and improve road safety, while politicians urging the roads minister to confirm an early start date for the eagerly-awaited scheme are confident that it can play a key role in the economic regeneration of the market town.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said last night: ldquoIt is estimated that it would take around  months to the start of construction from any decision to move to procurement and a further  months to construct the scheme subject to funding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21April2021-Young.jpg","title":"Young Irish dancers make a return to toe tapping action  ","story":"THE easing of restrictions afforded dancers from then locally-based Brennan Miskelly McCormick School of Irish Dancing toto outdoor classes last week.The school, which normally hosts classes in Downpatrick, Crossgar, Teconnaught and Castlewellan, was delighted to get back in action following five months of lockdown and online zoom classes.The week culminated in a presentation of certicates to the dancers who competed at an online feis run by An Comhairle Uladh.The school entered  dancers in this first ever online feis.

Relationships between the two at the helm are an insult to the electorate. Crucial decision-making is mired in hopeless procrastination.Angry words, whether they are over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Covid regulations, attendance at funerals or lockdown rules, pollute the political atmosphere. At a time when people from all backgrounds want clear-sighted direction, we get fudge, indecision, superficial strategic planning and costly mistakes.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The vast middle ground of Northern Ireland voters demand better. They want an end to grand-standing and would dearly like to see some maturity from The Executive Office. Demands from the DUP and the UUP for the head of the Chief Constable Simon Byrne was, in the view of many across our society, a scandalous politicisation of law and order. Despite denials to the contrary, thoughtless ramping up the rhetoric over the Protocol and the Storey funeral fiasco has directly contributed to recent scenes of street violence, sectarianism and confrontation.I deplore the mentally bankrupt attitude of Arlene Foster and of Steve Aiken in respect of the PSNI and the Chief Constable. That is not to ignore the ratcheting up of tensions by the words uttered by Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney, Colum Eastwood and Naomi Long.To predict ato terrorist violence that we worked so hard to bring to a close in  is grossly irresponsible, insensitive and wrong. Sane, sensible negotiations to make an Irish Sea Border or a hard border on this island unnecessary could have been achievedwe had seen some sensible contributions from Dublin and Westminster leadership. Instead, we got scare-mongering and shrill exchanges.Hundreds of thousands of people want nothing more than an end to sectarian friction and yearn for normality. I fully understand their disappointment and anger. As a unionist, I now fear they will register their disgust in next May’s Assembly election by staying at home.That would not be an answer but most of our frustrated voters want an end to mere sectarian headcounts.They want our leaders to behave like responsible adults and not petulant youngsters.We need to ‘call time’ on what passes for politics in Northern Ireland, and begin to think collaboratively and constructively to resolve real issues for families and our present pandemic-damaged economy. The age of the political ‘kindergarten’ needs to give way to grown-up politics that puts the needs of all our people first and foremost.We cannot go on limping from crisis to crisis. Overall, our politics are being undermined and I have to hope that the handbrake will be applied before democracy itself becomes the casualty.North and South of the border, the electorate took big decisions for all the right reasons in ’.Now, that same ‘can-do’ and confident spirit is needed to end the awful political incompetence. • Baron Maginnis of Drumglassis a former UUP MP, who became an independent Lord in Lord Morrow: A more conciliatory Irish approach is needed to end tensionsClick here – Mike Nesbitt: ‘Conversion therapy debate shows why we can’t have unionist unity’Click here – Nolan’s patience tested by SDLP man: ‘I’ve asked you  times’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMonday, April , marks the official ftieth birthday of Chapter Arts Centre in Cardf.The multi-artform venue was the first of its kind in Wales.CEO of Chapter, Andy Eagle said: ldquoChapter was originally set up by a community of artists and that remains its foundation and principal purpose. Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices. Chapter Fundraising gig, Pavilions in the Park. Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

In the Gallery are immersive works by South African artist Dineo Seshee Bopape - objects, drawing and sound are presented in spaces with walls covered in washes of soil from Welsh sacred sites.Talking about the programme since Chapter closed, Director of Programme Hannah Firth said: ldquoWhen our doors closed in March last year we wanted to ensure that we could still talk to our audiences and the creative community that is our beating heart.\"Despite the uncertainty faced by many artists, they showed an astonishing resilience and desire to quickly adapt to other ways of working and engaging.\"Wersquove been lucky enough to be able to work with some of them to create a dynamic programme of events and activity online and outdoors, and have developed a number of key commissions to support artists including on our lightbox, in our cafeacute bar, in our gallery, around the Canton community, and online.Chapter is currently getting ready to re-open. Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

Any attempt to reimagine education along transdisciplinary lines, with subjects being taught together, would require childrenrsquos attainment to be measured dferently, the researchers noted.Prof Burnard said: ldquoIt would require a system of testing which measures how children are internalising ideas and what they are expressing ndash not just what they know.ldquoThat may be an uncomfortable idea for some, but it is the sort of radical thinking we neededucation is going to prepare young people for the future..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Pupils would benefit from thinking like Da Vinci, researchers say article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He ordered the campaign bus to be emblazoned with the disputed claim that leaving the EU would save pound million a week to spend on the NHS.Critics complained that the figure failed to take into account the funding the UK received back from Brussels, but Mr Cummings was only too well aware that the controversy simply served to highlight the sums Britain was sending the EU. vw,vw,px, px\"Benedict Cumberbatch played Dominic Cummings in a Channel  drama about Brexit He was credited with devising the ldquoTake back control slogan which was seen to capture the mood of disillusionment which helped drive the Brexit vote.And he was responsible also for a final online advertising blitz highlighting a potential influx of immigrants from TurkeyBritain remained in the EU, even though there was no imminent prospect of the country joining the bloc.He later wrote thatMr Gove and Boris Johnson, who were fronting the campaign, had not ldquopicked up the baseball bat marked lsquoTurkey NHS pound millionrsquo with five weeks to go the result could have gone the other way.Through it all, Mr Cummings made no secret of his contempt for the senior Tories on the Vote Leave board, complaining they would prefer to spend weekends off with their girlfriends than the hard business of campaigning.There was therefore consternation among many at Westminster when Mr Johnson became prime minister in July  and chose Mr Cummings to head up his No  operation.Whitehall was given an early taste of how he would operate when he fired Sonia Khan, a special adviser to then chancellor Sajid Javid, and had her marched out of Downing Street by an armed police officer for alleged leaks. vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings in Downing Street With Parliament deadlocked over Brexit, he was seen as the author of the plan to prorogue its sittings, subsequently ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, and the purge of the One Nation Tories who refused to back Mr Johnsonrsquos deal for leaving the EU.When the Prime Minister finally secured the general election he craved, it was Mr Cummings who came up with another simple but brutally effective slogan ndash ldquoGet Brexit done ndash which helped propel him to an -seat majority.With the Governmentrsquos position finally secure, Mr Cummings set about some of his pet projects, including an overhaul of the machinery of government, warning there was a ldquohard rain coming for Whitehall.A long-standing critic of what he regarded as the Oxbridge mentality which dominated the upper echelons of the civil service, he appealed for ldquoweirdos and misfits with odd skills to transform the way the country was run.He was certainly happy to cultivate the image of himself as the outsider, turning up to work in Downing Street in ill-fitting jeans and scruffy jumpers rather than traditional suit and tie..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Cummings: a political maverick never far from controversy article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
