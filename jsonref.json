In 2015, she reportedly told the journalist Piers Morgan that she had not always sought showbusiness success.‘As a kid, I wanted to be either the president or a news broadcaster like you,’ she told him.

She is expected to retain her U.S. citizenship, as dual citizenship is permitted. Presidential candidates must be U.S. citizens.Meghan has cultivated a warm friendship with former U.S. president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, while chat show host Oprah Winfrey, who is one of the most influential women in America, was given a prime seat at St George’s Chapel Windsor, opposite the Royal Family.A royal historian says Meghan would find it difficult to enter U.S. politics while still married to Harry. ‘It is a pretty strong rule that members of the Royal Family keep out of politics,’ he says.Share this article    The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, leaving Windsor Castle after their weddingBut Harry could, of course, give up official royal duties. His mother, Princess Diana, was said to have considered moving to America.And the claim appears to have caused consternation at Kensington Palace yesterday, with the Duchess giving her official spokesman permission to take the unusual step of issuing a public denial.‘This conversation you describe with an associate is fictitious,’ the spokesman insisted.I am, though, not the only one to hear rumours that Meghan still holds political ambitions.Former Times editor Sir Simon Jenkins says: ‘Her friends and associates affirm that she is a political animal.‘Such is her fame, she could perfectly well follow a route taken by a certain Ronald Reagan. She might lead for the Democrats against a Republican Ivanka Trump. All I can say is, why not?’Meghan’s best friend is Jessica Mulroney, whose father-in-law, Brian, was prime minister of Canada for nine years.Meghan has strong political views and attacked Donald Trump in 2016 for being ‘isive’ and ‘misogynistic’. She might have to reach an accommodation with her new chum George Clooney, who is said to hold political ambitions of his own. Perhaps he could be her running mate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/01/4C898F2700000578-5759713-Auctioning_under_the_name_ClaireOliver87_the_listing_included_th-a-28_1527035182950.jpg","title":"Official royal wedding gift bag sells 21 400 eBay","story":"    Included in the listing was a bottle of Windsor Castle spring water, a fridge magnet, an over-sized chocolate coin, a tin of shortbread biscuits, a spectator badge, a spectator wristband, a parking sticker, the order of service, a postcard, a map and day briefing, entry card letter and finally the tote bag itself          Auctioning under the name ClaireOliver87, the listing included the entire contents of the gift bag as well as the paperwork received on and prior to the dayThe guests arrived at 9am to see 600 VIPs including the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles as well as the Clooneys, the Beckhams, Elton John and Oprah Winfrey turn up for the A-list wedding of the decade. And as 120,000 well-wishers fought for space outside the castle these privileged 1,200 were able to get great views of the newlyweds as they kissed outside the chapel and paraded past in the royal Ascot Landau carriage. But within hours of the event finishing dozens of their free hessian gift bags were being auctioned off to the highest bidder.Many of the sellers had clearly planned to do it in advance because they photographed the items outside St George\u0027s Chapel to ensure they looked genuine on eBay.           Bids for items have now reached more than £1,000 even though they were handed out for free by Meghan and Harry  Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Guests arriving in the grounds of Windsor Castle passed tables where bags were handed out to each guest but some have taken advantage of this generosity          The canvas bags had the happy couple\u0027s initials on the side and are being sold on the promise buyers will be getting a piece of royal wedding historySo why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed on Monday.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerProperty tycoon\u0027s estranged wife lives in small room in his mansion\u0027You hate Scottish people!\u0027: Alexa device unable to understand womanPrince Harry gives emotional speech for Prince Charles birthdayMeghan puts protective arm around Harry on newlyweds\u0027 first eventPrince Harry and Meghan attend Prince Charles\u0027 birthday partyHorrific moment Chinese boy is mauled by pit bull outside pet shopIncredible moment hippos save a wildebeest from a crocodileCCTV footage catches DPD drivers \u0027doing laughing gas\u0027 at wheelBaby hilariously reacts to seeing his dad without a beardadorable moment girl get\u0027s upset at not being invited to royal weddingPrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.  George and Amal Clooney were the among the huge stars to celebrate with Harry and Meghan with George dancing with the bride and Kate   From left: Priyanka Chopra, Serena Williams and Jessica Mulroney show off the dresses they wore to the royal wedding party          Revellers watch the fireworks display over George III\u0027s former stately where the reception of Harry and Meghan took placeMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerProperty tycoon\u0027s estranged wife lives in small room in his mansionFather of acid attack victim is \u0027glad\u0027 about new sentenceRussia military launches four missiles in submarine testHorrific moment three friends film themselves drowning in a pondBodycam reveals that activist LIED about being raped by a copIncredible moment hippos save a wildebeest from a crocodileCCTV footage catches DPD drivers \u0027doing laughing gas\u0027 at wheelBaby hilariously reacts to seeing his dad without a beardHorrific moment Chinese boy is mauled by pit bull outside pet shopMeghan puts protective arm around Harry on newlyweds\u0027 first eventExclusive details from inside the evening celebrations reveal that guests – including George and Amal Clooney, Sir Elton John and David Furnish and more glitzy actresses than an Oscars after-party – spent the evening sipping bespoke cocktails, tucking into \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 and candyfloss from outdoor stalls and dancing to a trendy DJ.It was, insiders say, \u0027the party to end all parties\u0027, with a carnival atmosphere in the grounds of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to George III.  Record viewing figures made Harry and Meghan’s wedding the TV event of the year so far.It was watched by a peak of 13.1million just after 1pm on BBC1, making it the biggest peak figure so far in 2018, the broadcaster said. ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million.

Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/03/4C6D6BBD00000578-5760259-image-m-50_1527041809494.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles sister says Doria Ragland looked like hockey player penalty box","story":"Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Grant fired off a series of barbs at Doria Ragland.

The plant is pictured above on Tuesday           Ten well were \u0027quenched\u0027 with water which countered the pressure of the volcanic steam below, to prevent the emission of toxic gases. An eleventh well was plugged with mud because water wouldn\u0027t cool it down. The plan on Tuesday           Lava has already crossed onto the plant\u0027s land and destroyed one building, was still about 1,000 feet from the wells on Tuesday\u0027All wells are stable at this point,\u0027 said Ige. County officials are also monitoring various gases that may leak into the atmosphere.A spike in gas levels could prompt a mass evacuation, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Talmadge Magno. Officials, however, have not discussed specific scenarios that would lead to such an emergency.Puna Geothermal, owned by Nevada\u0027s Ormat Technologies, was shut down shortly after Kilauea began spewing lava on May 3. The plant harnesses heat and steam from the earth\u0027s core to spin turbines to generate power. A flammable gas called pentane is used as part of the process, though officials earlier this month removed 50,000 gallons of it from the plant to reduce the chance of explosions.The plant has capacity to produce 38 megawatts of electricity, providing roughly one-quarter of the Big Island\u0027s daily energy demand.Lava destroyed a building near the plant late Monday, bringing the total number of structures overtaken in the past several weeks to nearly 50, including dozens of homes. The latest was a warehouse adjacent to the Puna plant, Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The building was owned by the state and was used in geothermal research projects in the early days of the site.           County officials say they are closely monitoring emissions, and will issue an evacuation if toxic fumes spike.

Goddess of fire, Pele, is believed to live on Kilauea volcano, and the plant itself is thought to desecrate her name.Other residents have voiced concerns over health and safety.Scientists, however, say the conditions on Kilauea make it a good site for harnessing the earth for renewable energy.\u0027There\u0027s heat beneath the ground if you dig deep enough everywhere,\u0027 said Laura Wisland, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. But in some places in the U.S. \u0027it\u0027s just hotter, and you can access the geothermal energy more easily.\u0027          Lava flows have already reached the ocean. When lava hits the cold ocean water, it creates a steam called laze which is toxic. Hawaiian and mariners are being warned to avoid this toxic steam.

We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up.

They can comfortably lift about half their body weight — so about five or six pound,\u0027 said Mr Ebi          The fox finally gives up. The mid-air tussle had ended within just eight seconds, according to the photographer\u0027I spent the day watching several young foxes, called kits, rest and play on the prairie. I counted at least eight kits. There are probably more. Shortly before sunset, they started hunting. One fox managed to snag a rabbit’s foot. Several kits gave chase, but it made it to its den to feed.\u0027About 15 minutes later, a red fox caught a rabbit and was carrying it across the meadow. I panned my camera with it to capture the action. Then behind me, I heard the cry of a bald eagle. I turned around and saw it approaching fast. I knew it wanted the rabbit. I intently trained my camera on the fox bracing for a split second of action.\u0027Mr Ebi said the scene \u0027was even more dramatic than I expected. I thought the fox would drop the rabbit, giving the eagle an easy dinner.\u0027To my surprise,Instead, the fox, with its jaw still clenched on the rabbit, inadvertently got snagged by the bald eagle.

They can comfortably lift about half their body weight — so about five or six pounds. The young fox and rabbit were likely just beyond that weight.\u0027Interestingly, rabbits aren’t the foxes\u0027 first choice for supper: \u0027They actually prefer insects, berries and voles. But the berries and voles have been displaced by the rabbits, which have clear-cut the prairie with their vast burrows.\u0027 The photographer added: \u0027Don’t worry: the fox was fine.

Sabrina\u0027s brother Kevin died in 2013 and she said that Justin helped her through the grief           Following the wedding the couple spent  their honeymoon in Cancun swimming with dolphins          Sabrina said that seeing Justin so emotional meant she struggled to hold herself together \u0027I\u0027m a Montreal Canadiens fan and he is a Maple Leafs fan so we really bonded over the fact that we were rivals.\u0027He came and picked me up after school one day and we walked home together.\u0027When first he told me he was in a wheelchair, I was a little bit caught off guard.\u0027I didn\u0027t want to say no, I didn\u0027t want to be that person.\u0027And at the end of the day he was still human and a guy who I seemed to have a connection with.\u0027When we started dating it was hard for my family and friends to understand why.\u0027But they soon grew to realize Justin was just like everyone else.\u0027The couple\u0027s wedding was tinged with sadness due to the absence of Sabrina\u0027s brother Kevin, who died following a tragic accident in 2013.          Sabrina said the pair initially bonded over supporting rival ice hockey teamsNewlywed Sabrina said she would have never gotten through the grief without her supportive partner.Sabrina said: \u0027Kevin was only 29 so it was an incredibly tough time for me and so hard to accept but luckily I had Justin.\u0027His grandpa Ted and his grandma Marge also passed away during our time together so I helped him through that. We\u0027re a great team.The couple began their new life together in Mexico, honeymooning near Cancun.Justin and Sabrina spent their vacation snorkeling and even swimming with dolphins.Justin said: \u0027I\u0027m always hesitant going on big trips but we had such a fantastic time.\u0027We snorkeled and swam with dolphins. It was paradise.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/16/4C7BAAFD00000578-0-image-m-60_1526918277992.jpg","title":"German sweet firm accused racism post royal wedding post chocolate marshmallow","story":"    The cartoon mock-up was posted on the day Meghan Markle married Prince HarrySuper Dickmann\u0027s post of a Schokokuss (chocolate kiss) was posted with the caption: \u0027What are you looking at?

However, players will be allowed to stay in the locker rooms The NFL has announced a new national anthem policy that requires all team personnel on the field to stand during The Star-Spangled Banner while allowing players the choice to remain in the locker room.\u0027This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,\u0027 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \u0027Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.\u0027 Beginning in 2009, the NFL required that all players be on the field during the national anthem.Under the new rules, teams will be fined for any personnel on the field that fails to show what the league determines to be appropriate respect for the anthem. The teams are then free to fine their own personnel, including players, for protesting during the anthem. So while some teams could have a policy requiring everyone on the field to stand, other franchises could choose to pay the league fines while allowing its players to demonstrate during The Star-Spangled Banner. The decision would put inidual teams at the forefront of the ongoing controversy surrounding the peaceful demonstrations, which  are aimed at raising awareness about inequality and police brutality against minorities.            The controversial issue exploded two years ago after then-San Francisco 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick (center) refused to stand to protest inequality and police brutality          Currently, NFL regulations say that players \u0027should\u0027 stand for The Star-Spangled Banner\u0027It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic,\u0027 Goodell said. \u0027This is not and was never the case.\u0027 Initially, the NFL Players Association did not seem receptive to the policy changes. \u0027Maybe this new rule proposal that is being voted on is a compromise between the NFL office and club CEOs on various sides of the issue, but certainly not with player leadership,\u0027 wrote NFLPA spokesman George Atallah. \u0027We weren\u0027t there or part of the discussions.\u0027NFL is \u0027considering 15-yard penalties for teams who kneel...I\u0027ll pay the fine!

Prior to a game in September, the Dallas Cowboys took a knee before rising as a team to stand for the national anthem. Since then, owner Jerry Jones has vocally opposed the protests          Both Eric Reid (right) and Colin Kaepernick (center) have sued the NFL owners for collusion, accusing the league of retaliating against them for their peaceful demonstrations Kaepernick has not played since 2016 and filed a collusion case against NFL owners alleging a concerted effort was made to keep him out of football. Former teammate Eric Reid, a safety with the 49ers and unrestricted free agent, is following suit.Reid, who joined Kaepernick in kneeling to bring attention to social injustice, visited only one team - the Cincinnati Bengals - and was asked if he would continue to kneel during the anthem by team ownership.Kaepernick had a visit scheduled with the Seattle Seahawks - the only team to host Kaepernick in 2017 - but it was postponed because management wanted greater clarity on Kaepernick\u0027s intentions during pregame.NFL games remain among the most watched programming on television, but ratings took another significant dip during the 2017 regular season amidst the controversial protests.The average audience was 14.9 million viewers per game, down 9.7 percent from 16.5 million viewers in the 2016 regular season, according to Nielsen. The 2016 viewership was down eight percent from the previous year.          President Donald Trump congratulated NASCAR on its attitude toward the anthem However, NBC\u0027s Sunday Night Football remained the season\u0027s ratings king for the seventh straight year, according to Nielsen. That beats the previous record set by Fox\u0027s \u0027American Idol\u0027 between 2005-06 and 2010-11.  The Sunday Night football games averaged 18.2 million TV viewers in 2017, a 29 percent margin over the runner-up: CBS\u0027s \u0027Thursday Night Football\u0027 On Monday, when welcoming stock car driver Martin Truex Jr. and his team to the White House, Trump again raised the topic of anthem protests. \u0027One thing I love about NASCAR is they do indeed stand for the playing of the National Anthem. They do indeed,\u0027 Trump said.\u0027Somebody said maybe you shouldn\u0027t say that, it\u0027ll be controversial and I said that\u0027s okay, NASCAR\u0027s not going to mind it at all. Right fellas? They don\u0027t mind it at all,\u0027 Trump added.Despite the President\u0027s enthusiasm for NASCAR and its attitude towards the national anthem, the sport\u0027s ratings have plummeted around 28 percent over the last two years, according to Forbes.           NFL commissioner Roger Goodell believes the league\u0027s new policy will put the focus back on the game and alleviate the controversy over the player protests The policy adopted today was approved in concert with the NFL\u0027s ongoing commitment to local communities and our country - one that is extraordinary in its scope, resources, and alignment with our players. We are dedicated to continuing our collaboration with players to advance the goals of justice and fairness in all corners of our society.The efforts by many of our players sparked awareness and action around issues of social justice that must be addressed. The platform that we have created together is certainly unique in professional sports and quite likely in American business. We are honored to work with our players to drive progress.It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic. This is not and was never the case.This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem. Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.We believe today\u0027s decision will keep our focus on the game and the extraordinary athletes who play it - and on our fans who enjoy it.POLICY STATEMENTThe 32 member clubs of the National Football League have reaffirmed their strong commitment to work alongside our players to strengthen our communities and advance social justice. The unique platform that we have created is unprecedented in its scope, and will provide extraordinary resources in support of programs to promote positive social change in our communities.The membership also strongly believes that:All team and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.The Game Operations Manual will be revised to remove the requirement that all players be on the field for the Anthem.Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room or in a similar location off the field until after the Anthem has been performed.A club will be fined by the League if its personnel are on the field and do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.Each club may develop its own work rules, consistent with the above principles, regarding its personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.The Commissioner will impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.        (source: NFL.com)                                                     NFL owners expected to approve new national anthem policyDetroit Lions president Rod Wood: NFL must get anthem issue \u0027resolved\u0027Roger Goodell\u0027s statement on national anthem policy - NFL.comJets chairman Christopher Johnson says he’ll pay anthem-related league fines for his players | Newsday"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/19/4C90C9A800000578-0-image-m-10_1527100596980.jpg","title":"Girl 5 cries told Royal Wedding","story":"Lola Brown, 5, from Belfast, was convinced she was going to the royal wedding having followed the extensive coverage and was devastated to discover she was not goingShe said: \u0027As I was making dinner, Lola asked me Mum is my dress for Megan\u0027s wedding in London or are we going to pick it up on the way to the airport to go to London.\u0027That\u0027s when I realised she believed in she was actually going to the royal wedding. Who the hair are you?

We are challenging all supermarkets to reduce their single-use plastic footprints in the shortest time possible, and in the meantime they should pull out all the stops to remove unnecessary and non-recyclable plastic packaging by 2019. \u0027Now we know what it\u0027s doing to our oceans, it simply has to go.\u0027 Details of the Tesco plan were revealed by Chief Product Officer, Jason Tarry, who was speaking to hundreds of suppliers at an event organised by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IDG) yesterday. As well as replacing plastic, Tesco is campaigning for the UK to adopt a so-called \u0027closed loop system\u0027 on packaging where everything that is used is collected and recycled, The Grocer reported.It said this will require the Government and local councils to set up a uniform recycling system across UK, replacing the current regime where there are \u0027extreme\u0027 differences in the materials that are collected between towns.Mr Tarry said: \u0027We are committed to reducing the total amount of packaging used across our business.

Best for Britain was launched last April ahead of the snap general election. It was fronted by Gina Miller (pictured), who took the Government to court over Brexit\u0027Those MPs who are seeking to dilute or delay Brexit must now admit that their meaningful vote is really just their plan to stop Brexit – as this document sets out unambiguously.\u0027Richard Tice, of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, said: \u0027George Soros, the billionaire who does not live in the UK, will stop at nothing with his elitist friends to stop Brexit, deceitfully masking their plans as a people\u0027s vote. \u0027Shamefully, they want to deny the poorest in our society from benefiting the most from Brexit.\u0027Best for Britain was launched last April ahead of the snap general election. It was fronted by Gina Miller, who took the Government to court over Brexit, but she quit earlier this year after becoming uncomfortable with the group\u0027s tactics.It emerged in February that Best for Britain had accepted a £400,000 donation from Mr Soros, the Hungarian-born financier who bet against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 – earning him one billion dollars.           Pictured: Best for Britain boss Gina Miller pictured in central London in May last year He then promised £100,000 more, matching a crowdfunding push, and later gave another £300,000.Board members include Lord Malloch-Brown, who was a foreign minister under Gordon Brown, and chief executive Eloise Todd, who worked in Brussels for Bono\u0027s charity ONE.When the campaign was founded, its backers claimed they respected the result of the EU referendum. But it has been putting up billboards around the country calling for a second vote and the document says its strategic goals include: \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 and \u0027win a people\u0027s vote to stay and lead in Europe\u0027.It sets out a three-pronged strategy to persuade \u0027soft\u0027 Leave voters to change their minds, mobilise hardline Remainers into action, and shift the Labour Party into an anti-Brexit stance.Best for Britain says it will \u0027attach our case to the big non-Brexit issues that have emotional resonance – we need to break out from the Brexit bubble\u0027. Using social media, it wants \u0027reach out to where people are engaged – physically but mostly digitally\u0027. It also pledges to \u0027cut through by being bold and embracing the disruptive\u0027.          Former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson (pictured) said a document reveals how far some Remainers would go to overturn the result of the referendum of June 2016In the next few weeks Best for Britain will start arguing the Brexit referendum was not a rejection of the EU: \u0027This was a vote against London as much as Brussels.\u0027Over the summer, its message will focus on how Brexit is \u0027putting the UK\u0027s unity and security at risk\u0027. In October – when it is expected that the outline of the Prime Minister\u0027s deal with Brussels will be known – the document reveals that the group has already decided to argue: \u0027Now we can finally see the real facts, this is not what we voted for.\u0027Best for Britain activists are instructed to \u0027survey local issues and concerns and link these to impact of Brexit\u0027.They started with grassroots events for constituency Labour parties earlier this month, with plans to start work on \u0027mobilising the unions\u0027 in the next fortnight.In July, the group is planning to lobby the policy conference of Unite, the country\u0027s largest trade union. In August, it is organising a \u0027Labour Against Brexit\u0027 speaking tour that will see senior figures make the case for remaining in the EU.          In September it will have a presence at both the TUC and Labour Party annual conferences.When MPs return to Parliament after party conference season, it is planning to bring hundreds of activists to London to confront them. The document says: \u0027We\u0027ve raised £2.4million, we need another £3.2million. \u0027Our activity is essentially scalable – how many we reach is directly proportional to what we can spend.\u0027A Best for Britain spokesman said: \u0027We have never hidden our agenda. Our aim as an organisation is to stop Brexit democratically. \u0027We want to connect people across the country to their MPs, particularly in the Labour Party, so they directly hear from their membership and their voters, the vast majority of whom want to make sure we have a real debate on Brexit before our options are taken off the table.\u0027Brexit is taking longer than people expected, costing more, and stopping us from creating a better Britain that works for everyone.\u0027But former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: \u0027This dossier is yet another example of the complacent Establishment trying to stitch up the people.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/00/05CD88FD000003E8-0-image-a-3_1527117558673.jpg","title":"Puffin numbers halved Beast East Englands biggest colony devastated","story":"    Adult puffins on breeding cliffs.

A lone puffin on Skellig Michael in Ireland. The species has been  devastated by severe weather in England which has wiped out almost half of some colonies           Severe weather including the Beast from the East has been blamed for the puffin population crisis on Northumberland’s Farne IslandsGwen Potter, a countryside manager for the National Trust in Northumberland, said: ‘We’ve had a very harsh winter and increased frequency of stormy seas means it’s harder for puffins to forage.’ Puffins, who spend winter out at sea, have been four weeks later than usual returning to the islands this year, which the trust believes is due to the weather.Miss Potter said the severe weather is due to climate change. This affects the puffin’s main food source, sand eels, which move further north to find colder seas.

But figures last week showed the NHS had lost 1,300 GPs since 2015 because more are leaving than are being recruited. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard of the Royal College of GPs said: \u0027The pressures GPs and our teams are working under are unsustainable. Our workload has escalated in volume and complexity in recent years but investment in our profession is less than a decade ago.\u0027Patient, 61, wakes up from operation to find surgeon has...\u0027Cowardly\u0027 traffic warden is slammed for slapping a FUNERAL...Share this articleIn surgeries which impose restrictions, patients can still make an emergency or same-day appointment, but only if they are seriously ill. They are usually assessed over the phone in a \u0027triage\u0027 process by a doctor or sometimes a receptionist who will assess the severity of their condition.Dr Richard Vautrey, head of the British Medical Association\u0027s GP committee said: \u0027This is further evidence of the pressures practices are under, with growing demands for appointments not being matched with an ability to provide them due to the continuing recruitment and retention crisis in general practice. Over recent years the number of consultations has been steadily rising while the GP workforce has been declining.\u0027Surgeries are now left in the position where telephone triage is the only method by which staff are able to handle this demand in a safe manner. But this can result in increased stress for many GPs as they try to manage so many patients each day.\u0027          In the survey of 769 GPs, 16.5 per cent said they had been forced to temporarily cancel routine appointments in the previous 12 monthsIn Workington, Cumbria, GP Dr Jennifer Lyall said her own practice had been forced to resort to a telephone triage system at one point.\u0027This was due to lack of GPs,\u0027 she explained. \u0027We had only two permanent GPs for a 7,000-patient practice.\u0027 Dr Peter Lewis, who had to take similar measures in Leeds, said: \u0027The reason was a combination of a failure to recruit partners and it was school holidays, so the partners here were already committed to holidays abroad,\u0027 he said. What\u0027s more there was \u0027no chance\u0027 of getting locum coverage during the holidays.Dr Martin Tant, from Alford, Lincolnshire, said his surgery stopped allowing patients to make routine appointments because they were fully booked for a month.\u0027We ran out of appointments,\u0027 he said.The shortage of doctors is also driving up waiting times and a Mail-commissioned survey in April found that half of patients could not get an appointment within a week.Some said they had to wait between three or four weeks and several said they had gone privately instead."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/00/065F52DC000003E8-0-image-m-34_1527118407439.jpg","title":"Lord Speaker Norman Fowler better value MPs","story":"    Norman Fowler: \u0027The process of reduction is now under way – and I should emphasise that this is being done without the benefit of Government legislation, but rather by peers themselves. The size of the House is now falling and will continue to fall\u0027Yesterday’s Daily Mail reported a poll which it said suggested that the House of Lords was outdated, outsized and out of touch with the British public. Let me set out five short reasons why I do not believe the House of Lords should be discarded in this way.First, the Daily Mail poll suggests that seven in ten voters believe there should be fewer peers than the current 780. I totally agree. That is why I set up a special committee under Terry Burns to propose how we could reduce it.They suggested an overall cap of 600 members, not to be exceeded, and limited terms of service for new peers. In a debate last December, the Lords itself endorsed that report. The process of reduction is now under way – and I should emphasise that this is being done without the benefit of Government legislation, but rather by peers themselves. The size of the House is now falling and will continue to fall.Second, it is ludicrously unjust to characterise peers as ‘dinosaurs in ermine’. We may have an older membership than the House of Commons but with age comes experience and we have acknowledged experts in virtually every area and a far greater level of expertise than any other senate I know of in the world.Parliament set to debate sweeping reforms of the House of...The dotty grandees are gone... peers are just bland blobs...Share this articleIn defence we have distinguished military leaders like Alan West, the former First Sea Lord, Richard Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff and Jock Stirrup from the RAF, who was also Chief of the Defence Staff.

Among the historians and broadcasters, we have Peter Hennessy, Joan Bakewell and Melvyn Bragg. For obvious reasons, the depth of knowledge here vastly exceeds anything available in the younger House of Commons.  \u0027With age comes experience and we have acknowledged experts in virtually every area. We have distinguished military leaders like Alan West, the former First Sea Lord, Richard Dannatt (left), the former Chief of the General Staff and Jock Stirrup from the RAF, who was also Chief of the Defence Staff. Or if we take health, we have figures like Robert Winston (right) and Ara Darzi\u0027Third, there has been criticism of the House for pressing amendments on the Brexit Bill, but this ignores the fact that the final decision on all these amendments rests with the Commons – the elected chamber. Our only power is to ask the Commons to consider again. It would be odd if this Bill – of profound importance – was the only Bill which escaped such scrutiny.It should be added that of the 201 amendments which were made to the Bill in the House of Lords, 178 of them were proposed by the Government, again underlining the importance of the Second Chamber in improving legislation.Fourth, the vast majority of peers are hardworking and honest. I in no way defend anyone who has been shown to abuse the allowances system. I will refer any substantive complaint to the Commissioner for Standards for independent investigation.As for the £305 allowance itself, you might remember that the many peers who live outside London require either a hotel room or lodgings for the night, and have to meet this expense and any secretarial expenses out of this flat allowance. Everyone who claims has to sign a declaration that they have undertaken genuine parliamentary work.Fifth, on the question of cost, the overall cost of the Lords is approximately £100million a year, compared with the Commons which is over £200million a year.Moreover, the annual cost of each member based on the average allowances claimed is £22,000 a year, less than a third of an MP’s salary, let alone their additional expenses.The Lords cannot simply be written off as enemies of the referendum or enemies of Brexit – there are many views in the House on those subjects as there are on a range of issues. I was in the House of Commons for over 30 years and I cannot recall ever hearing calls for its abolition on the grounds that members held views which were considered out of step.We are a strong enough parliamentary democracy to permit differences of view, honestly held – particularly with the safeguard that the final decision rests with elected MPs."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/01/4C920C9000000578-0-image-m-13_1527120175960.jpg","title":"Loophole allows Ofsted outstanding schools avoid inspections 10 years","story":"    Some outstanding schools have escaped Ofsted inspections for the past 10 years           The loophole has allowed 1,620 schools to avoid inspection for more than six yearsThe aim is to let high-flying schools concentrate on teaching without having to worry about inspections.But the NAO’s audit of Ofsted found that 1,620 schools had not been inspected for six years or more, including 296 which have gone without for more than a decade and a small number for up to 13 years.Now Ofsted itself wants an end to the exemption because it lets schools avoid inspection forever if they stay below the radar after an ‘outstanding’ rating.British family car that drives itself but won\u0027t cost the...Share this articleDirector of corporate strategy Luke Tryl said some schools may now have slipped to ‘middling’, adding: ‘We don’t think the exemption is sustainable. It is one of the biggest factors undermining confidence in the reliability of our judgements.’Ofsted is unable to close the loophole by itself and is lobbying for a change in the relevant law so inspectors would visit outstanding primaries every six years and secondaries every five to seven years.The NAO findings also raise the prospect of some ‘outstanding’ schools failing Ofsted’s new ‘British Values’ criteria.Under rules introduced after the ‘Trojan Horse’ Islamic extremism scare, all schools must teach gender equality, tolerance of gay people and respect for democracy.The report also found Ofsted was missing inspection targets amid high staff turnover and falling budgets – the watchdog spent 52 per cent less in real terms in 2017-18 than it did in 1999-2000.Ofsted says that at the turn of the millennium, a team of 16 to 17 inspectors would go into secondary schools for a whole week every six or seven years. Now a ‘good’ school gets two inspectors for one day every four years.

County officials are also monitoring various gases that may leak into the atmosphere.A spike in gas levels could prompt a mass evacuation, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Talmadge Magno. Officials, however, have not discussed specific scenarios that would lead to such an emergency.Puna Geothermal, owned by Nevada\u0027s Ormat Technologies, was shut down shortly after Kilauea began spewing lava on May 3. The plant harnesses heat and steam from the earth\u0027s core to spin turbines to generate power. A flammable gas called pentane is used as part of the process, though officials earlier this month removed 50,000 gallons of it from the plant to reduce the chance of explosions.The plant has capacity to produce 38 megawatts of electricity, providing roughly one-quarter of the Big Island\u0027s daily energy demand.Lava destroyed a building near the plant late Monday, bringing the total number of structures overtaken in the past several weeks to nearly 50, including dozens of homes. The latest was a warehouse adjacent to the Puna plant, Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The building was owned by the state and was used in geothermal research projects in the early days of the site.           County officials say they are closely monitoring emissions, and will issue an evacuation if toxic fumes spike.

Goddess of fire, Pele, is believed to live on Kilauea volcano, and the plant itself is thought to desecrate her name.Other residents have voiced concerns over health and safety.Scientists, however, say the conditions on Kilauea make it a good site for harnessing the earth for renewable energy.\u0027There\u0027s heat beneath the ground if you dig deep enough everywhere,\u0027 said Laura Wisland, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. But in some places in the U.S. \u0027it\u0027s just hotter, and you can access the geothermal energy more easily.\u0027          Lava flows have already reached the ocean.

However, players will be allowed to stay in the locker rooms The NFL has announced a new national anthem policy that requires all team personnel on the field to stand during The Star-Spangled Banner while allowing players the choice to remain in the locker room.\u0027This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,\u0027 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \u0027Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.\u0027 Beginning in 2009, the NFL required that all players be on the field during the national anthem.Under the new rules, teams will be fined for any personnel on the field that fails to show what the league determines to be appropriate respect for the anthem. The teams are then free to fine their own personnel, including players, for protesting during the anthem. So while some teams could have a policy requiring everyone on the field to stand, other franchises could choose to pay the league fines while allowing its players to demonstrate during The Star-Spangled Banner. The decision would put inidual teams at the forefront of the ongoing controversy surrounding the peaceful demonstrations, which  are aimed at raising awareness about inequality and police brutality against minorities.            The controversial issue exploded two years ago after then-San Francisco 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick (center) refused to stand to protest inequality and police brutality          Currently, NFL regulations say that players \u0027should\u0027 stand for The Star-Spangled Banner\u0027It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic,\u0027 Goodell said. \u0027This is not and was never the case.\u0027 Initially, the NFL Players Association did not seem receptive to the policy changes. \u0027Maybe this new rule proposal that is being voted on is a compromise between the NFL office and club CEOs on various sides of the issue, but certainly not with player leadership,\u0027 wrote NFLPA spokesman George Atallah. \u0027We weren\u0027t there or part of the discussions.\u0027NFL is \u0027considering 15-yard penalties for teams who kneel...I\u0027ll pay the fine! Jets chairman says he WON\u0027T penalize...Share this articleThe NFLPA released an official statement Wednesday afternoon. \u0027The NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this new policy,\u0027 read the statement. \u0027NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about.\u0027The vote by NFL club CEOs today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Chairman of the NFL’s Management Council John Mara about the principles, values and patriotism of our League.\u0027Our union will review the new policy and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement.\u0027According to an ESPN report, the idea had the support of \u0027at least 24 owners.\u0027 One objector, New York Jets chairman Christopher Johnson, told Newsday that he would pay the league\u0027s fine, but not fine any of his players that choose to protest during the anthem.          Prior to a game in September, the Dallas Cowboys took a knee before rising as a team to stand for the national anthem. Since then, owner Jerry Jones has vocally opposed the protests          Both Eric Reid (right) and Colin Kaepernick (center) have sued the NFL owners for collusion, accusing the league of retaliating against them for their peaceful demonstrations Kaepernick has not played since 2016 and filed a collusion case against NFL owners alleging a concerted effort was made to keep him out of football. Former teammate Eric Reid, a safety with the 49ers and unrestricted free agent, is following suit.Reid, who joined Kaepernick in kneeling to bring attention to social injustice, visited only one team - the Cincinnati Bengals - and was asked if he would continue to kneel during the anthem by team ownership.Kaepernick had a visit scheduled with the Seattle Seahawks - the only team to host Kaepernick in 2017 - but it was postponed because management wanted greater clarity on Kaepernick\u0027s intentions during pregame.NFL games remain among the most watched programming on television, but ratings took another significant dip during the 2017 regular season amidst the controversial protests.The average audience was 14.9 million viewers per game, down 9.7 percent from 16.5 million viewers in the 2016 regular season, according to Nielsen. The 2016 viewership was down eight percent from the previous year.          President Donald Trump congratulated NASCAR on its attitude toward the anthem However, NBC\u0027s Sunday Night Football remained the season\u0027s ratings king for the seventh straight year, according to Nielsen. That beats the previous record set by Fox\u0027s \u0027American Idol\u0027 between 2005-06 and 2010-11.  The Sunday Night football games averaged 18.2 million TV viewers in 2017, a 29 percent margin over the runner-up: CBS\u0027s \u0027Thursday Night Football\u0027 On Monday, when welcoming stock car driver Martin Truex Jr. and his team to the White House, Trump again raised the topic of anthem protests. \u0027One thing I love about NASCAR is they do indeed stand for the playing of the National Anthem. They do indeed,\u0027 Trump said.\u0027Somebody said maybe you shouldn\u0027t say that, it\u0027ll be controversial and I said that\u0027s okay, NASCAR\u0027s not going to mind it at all. Right fellas? They don\u0027t mind it at all,\u0027 Trump added.Despite the President\u0027s enthusiasm for NASCAR and its attitude towards the national anthem, the sport\u0027s ratings have plummeted around 28 percent over the last two years, according to Forbes.           NFL commissioner Roger Goodell believes the league\u0027s new policy will put the focus back on the game and alleviate the controversy over the player protests The policy adopted today was approved in concert with the NFL\u0027s ongoing commitment to local communities and our country - one that is extraordinary in its scope, resources, and alignment with our players. We are dedicated to continuing our collaboration with players to advance the goals of justice and fairness in all corners of our society.The efforts by many of our players sparked awareness and action around issues of social justice that must be addressed. The platform that we have created together is certainly unique in professional sports and quite likely in American business. We are honored to work with our players to drive progress.It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic. This is not and was never the case.This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem. Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.We believe today\u0027s decision will keep our focus on the game and the extraordinary athletes who play it - and on our fans who enjoy it.POLICY STATEMENTThe 32 member clubs of the National Football League have reaffirmed their strong commitment to work alongside our players to strengthen our communities and advance social justice. The unique platform that we have created is unprecedented in its scope, and will provide extraordinary resources in support of programs to promote positive social change in our communities.The membership also strongly believes that:All team and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.The Game Operations Manual will be revised to remove the requirement that all players be on the field for the Anthem.Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room or in a similar location off the field until after the Anthem has been performed.A club will be fined by the League if its personnel are on the field and do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.Each club may develop its own work rules, consistent with the above principles, regarding its personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.The Commissioner will impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.        (source: NFL.com)                                                     NFL owners expected to approve new national anthem policyDetroit Lions president Rod Wood: NFL must get anthem issue \u0027resolved\u0027Roger Goodell\u0027s statement on national anthem policy - NFL.comJets chairman Christopher Johnson says he’ll pay anthem-related league fines for his players | Newsday"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/19/4C90C9A800000578-0-image-m-10_1527100596980.jpg","title":"Girl 5 cries told Royal Wedding","story":"Lola Brown, 5, from Belfast, was convinced she was going to the royal wedding having followed the extensive coverage and was devastated to discover she was not goingShe said: \u0027As I was making dinner, Lola asked me Mum is my dress for Megan\u0027s wedding in London or are we going to pick it up on the way to the airport to go to London.\u0027That\u0027s when I realised she believed in she was actually going to the royal wedding. Who the hair are you?

But figures last week showed the NHS had lost 1,300 GPs since 2015 because more are leaving than are being recruited. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard of the Royal College of GPs said: \u0027The pressures GPs and our teams are working under are unsustainable. Our workload has escalated in volume and complexity in recent years but investment in our profession is less than a decade ago.\u0027Patient, 61, wakes up from operation to find surgeon has...\u0027Cowardly\u0027 traffic warden is slammed for slapping a FUNERAL...Share this articleIn surgeries which impose restrictions, patients can still make an emergency or same-day appointment, but only if they are seriously ill. They are usually assessed over the phone in a \u0027triage\u0027 process by a doctor or sometimes a receptionist who will assess the severity of their condition.Dr Richard Vautrey, head of the British Medical Association\u0027s GP committee said: \u0027This is further evidence of the pressures practices are under, with growing demands for appointments not being matched with an ability to provide them due to the continuing recruitment and retention crisis in general practice. Over recent years the number of consultations has been steadily rising while the GP workforce has been declining.\u0027Surgeries are now left in the position where telephone triage is the only method by which staff are able to handle this demand in a safe manner.

I christened them Kesh Angels and gave them heart-shaped sunglasses’When I first met Karima, she was 14 years old and selling bracelets in Djemaa el-Fna, the bustling central square in Marrakech. She’s the girl on the very right here, leaning to the side. They’re all henna girls now, Karima and her friends, and they posed for this in 2010, in front of the Theatre Royal in Marrakech.Djemaa el-Fna, which means “internal space”, is where all the snake-charmers, storytellers and belly-dancers work, in among food stalls and other types of entertainment. The square’s been there for centuries. It’s like a vast piece of street theatre, full of people all day long – tourists and Moroccans alike, there to buy food, have henna done on their hands, or just become part of the big play. Karima and her friends understand the camera: they know how to play to an audience. They are artists. The bikes are their own: Marrakech is famously a bike city. Because of the way the Medina – the old Arab quarter – is built, it can take you 15 minutes by bike to reach the main road and the new town, but half an hour if you’re walking. So everybody goes by bike.Although I was born in Morocco, I spent part of my childhood in England, so have a different perspective on my country. I like to push buttons. Here, I wanted to play with the way a veiled woman riding a motorbike might seem jarring from a western perspective. I called them Kesh Angels, with Kesh short for Marrakech, and Angels from Hell’s Angels.It can be hard to tell, because of the way I usually set up my images, but here they’re all wearing their own clothing. The only props I gave them were some socks and the heart-shaped sunglasses, just to have a bit of fun with the cliche of the rock star, the biker in the leather jacket. I work with whatever I can find cheap in markets. I think the glasses came from Camden in London. I’m constantly collecting stuff and pulling it out at the right moment – either to use as props, or to put borders around my images. The borders are partly just a graphic pattern, but I also like mixing recognisable western brands with Arabic writing and goods. Sometimes they reference the subject of the shot: I’ll use beef stock cans, for example, when I’m shooting a beefy guy.A lot of planning goes into a shoot and I always start with a sketch. But then I go with the flow. This was an extremely lively shoot. Once I set up the scene, the women started loosening up. I have some other images of us all riding en masse, from location to location, messing about. We had a lot of fun. I used a wide angle, shooting from below, to create something cinematic. I was looking at classic photography from 1950s Italy and America, as well as the martial arts movies and music videos I grew up with. And I chose this location for its movie-like quality. The theatre is one of the biggest in Africa: I liked that it is obviously Arabic – and unfinished. Also, its modern appearance contrasts with the women’s traditional garb.There were four cinemas in my town when I was growing up in Morocco. I remember the movie posters they’d put in their windows. They had these powerful single images your mind could latch on to, allowing anyone who couldn’t afford a ticket to imagine the whole film. That’s what I wanted to create here – a still from a movie you haven’t seen.

I’m from a traditional Bangladeshi Muslim background and back then my life in east London was very different. We didn’t have social media, or even mobile phones – just going to a friend’s house was difficult because my parents were very protective. I didn’t wear much make-up and rather than flick through magazines and read about beauty like other girls my age, I would devour anything I could find about Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee.But at 18, my life changed. I went to a Muay Thai class (a form of kickboxing that’s generally regarded as the world’s toughest martial art) and found something I’d never experienced before.When I’m training and competing, I don’t care about the way I look. I feel confident in just being me. I’ll wear a really hydrating moisturiser so that my skin feels good but that’s all. Away from the ring, it’s a different story. I love fashion and makeup. Thanks to my career – I became the British and world champion for Muay Thai boxing for my weight category in 2016 – I go to a lot of awards ceremonies, and for those, I like to wear heels and a beautiful dress. I’ll go with foundation, concealer, lipstick, blusher and maybe a highlighter if I’m in the mood. I have an extensive makeup collection – I like to look elegant and pretty when I’m away from the gym but I still want to look like me. No fake eyelashes!As a society, we’re keen to put people into boxes – either you’re sporty or glamorous, you can’t be both … but that’s not true. I can be taken seriously as an athlete and look glamorous when I’m outside the ring. I firmly believe that when it comes to how you look and who you are, you should never try to please other people – if you’re pleased with yourself, then it will radiate through.When I started doing this, I was simply following a passion. Later on, I realised that I had become a role model and I didn’t know how to embrace that. But eventually, I said to myself, you’ve got an amazing platform to really inspire the next generation: to inspire girls, Muslim women, people with ME and chronic fatigue (I’ve suffered for years), people from ethnic minorities, people from low-income backgrounds – these are all obstacles I’ve faced in my own journey. But I’ve succeeded and because of that I feel confident and, yes, beautiful too. Being beautiful is simply about being bold and embracing who you are – that, combined with learning your craft and working hard, is what makes people respect you.At the moment, so many girls are reluctant to pursue sport and I think that’s often because they see it as somehow unfeminine. That’s something I’m determined to change. I train girls and some of them comment on my Instagram feed, and say it’s amazing that I don’t use filters to make myself look better in photos. I try to explain that I don’t need to do that because I’m confident in how I look – whether that’s sweating and makeup-free in the ring, or all dressed up, in mascara and lipstick. Either way, I’m comfortable as I am and that’s what I want them to feel, too. I want them to discover what their bodies are capable of – everyone has strengths and it’s about discovering yours and pursuing that.This year, I’ve switched from Muay Thai to boxing. It’s a completely different discipline. While I’ve got the strength and the fighter’s mentality from kickboxing, the timing, the balance, the guard and the footwork are all different. I’m in training twice a day, six days a week, and living on a very strict diet while I build my foundations in this new sport. I know the road might not be straight but I’m not going to give up. A fighter’s mentality is about having resilience. When I’m in the ring, my coach and my manager won’t be able to help me. I’ve got to rely on myself and know how to be my own best friend.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa ParryStyling: Steph Stevens make up: Jose Bass hair: Jamie McCormick"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ff16fb470a460865750db88339a3d4111f772d3/0_0_1588_953/master/1588.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99bc891241dd4e36cffba4c75a64b610","title":"your best ever skin five beauty mantras to follow religiously","story":"From dewy-skin secrets and sunscreen misting to foundation on ice – listen to your mamas and makeup artists when it comes to the best beauty tipsFrom dewy-skin secrets and sunscreen misting to foundation on ice – listen to your mamas and makeup artists when it comes to the best beauty tipsAs a beauty editor who has been writing about the subject for many years, I am so often touted as an expert. The reality, however, is that much of the beauty knowledge and knowhow I put into practice on a regular basis has been inspired by some of the amazing women in my life – from my mother to my favourite makeup artist – who have shared their tips and tricks with me. And now I am sharing them with you.Mind your décolletageLong before neck creams became a thing, my mother always highlighted the importance of treating your décolletage (that space between your chin and your chest) as you would the skin on your face. Although I was barely into my teens, she made a (daily) point of making sure I had meticulously washed and moisturised my neck and chest. She was adamant that if I didn’t do this, the texture and hue beyond my chin would start to look significantly different to the one on my face. It was exhausting having this relentless mantra sounding in your ear. As a young girl, taking care of the skin on my neck was the least of my priorities. Decades later, however, my mother’s advice has paid off she spoke the truth. It is a beauty step I follow to this day, and I now tell everyone who cares to listen, because it is never too late to start.So far, so perfect. But what happens when, one day, you look in the mirror and for some strange reason your perfect foundation doesn’t look quite as perfect as it did before? “Don’t blame it on the foundation,” says my long-time makeup artist friend. She believes a myriad of reasons could affect the finish – your hormones, change in season (every girl needs more than one shade to accommodate this), lack of sleep … “It’s all about how you store it,” she says. Most people keep their foundation in the (humid, steamy) bathroom, or in their bedroom, where it is exposed to the sun and direct light. All of this oxidises your foundation, which affects the colour, texture and its appearance when on your skin. The trick to keeping your perfect foundation perfect, she reveals, is to keep it in the fridge. Trust me, it works.Apply concealer after foundationMy younger sister is a huge beauty fan, but she doesn’t work in the beauty industry and by no means would she ever even call herself an expert. And yet I learn some of the most wonderful tricks and tips from her. She is the one who first introduced me to the joys of concealers. From her I learned that applying your foundation first and your concealer second is a much better way to ensure you don’t overdo it and end up with a cakey finish halfway through the day. I love a concealer that feels lightweight but provides full flawless coverage, such as the Clinique Beyond Perfecting Super Concealer, but when I apply my foundation first, I find I don’t need to use half as much – everything blends much more seamlessly and it stays that way all day.Supercharge your beauty routine with hyaluronic acidOne of the benefits of my job is that I get to meet women who are doing incredible things in the beauty industry. One of my favourites is a prolific dermatologist who works with some of Hollywood’s most famous faces. She was one of the first skincare experts I heard extolling the benefits of hyaluronic acid, which holds 1,000 times its weight in moisture. It has become my skincare mainstay. My dermatologist encouraged me to blend it into my foundation and powder highlighter before applying – this gives you the dewiest skin ever. She also advised mixing it into powdery or glittery eyeshadows – it is kinder to the eyes, goes on the lids without dragging and the end result is a much more silky, modern-looking finish, with major skincare benefits.Top up your SPF with clever mists Facials are quite possibly my favourite beauty treatment. I tend to battle uneven skin tone, so a good facial complements my skincare regime, which is infused with brighteners, acid exfoliators, vitamin C and a good SPF. Without sun protection, UV rays exacerbate my hyperpigmentation issues. And so I have long been religious about using a high SPF every day. What I didn’t know, however, was that I was doing it all wrong. My facialist taught me that my SPF is only effective when it is constantly topped up (ideally every two hours). This, of course, poses a dilemma: how on earth do you keep applying SPF throughout your working day, while you still have your makeup on? She introduced me to the idea of sunscreen mists and makeup-setting sprays that have SPF in them (some pressed powders also have SPF in, and can be brushed on during the day). Not only are these mists brilliant for dealing with the heat and refreshing your face and providing protection, but you can also spray them right through the day without it ruining your makeup.

Kimmel then asked if she knew if it would be changed. “I’ve been in discussions with them and they’re gracious,” she said. “They obviously didn’t want this to happen.”She has also been told that she will have approval over the next attempt.On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the host started by creating a memorable mental image. “We have passed certain milestones on Trump’s highway to American greatness,” he said. “Sometimes you just have to pull the car over, get a breath of fresh air, maybe puke in the grass.”He believes that one of those moments is now after Trump called for an investigation into the investigation into him.“Some people are calling this a constitutional crisis but I don’t know about that,” he said. “A constitutional crisis technically requires that one branch of the government push back against another branch of the government. Everybody here is pushing in the same direction, and it’s down with a pillow over the constitution’s face going: ‘Sssssshhhh, it’ll be over soon.’”He then joked that the constitution has changed under Trump’s reign. “It’s gotten so bad that the opening words have gone from ‘We the people’ to ‘Help, I’ve forgotten the safe word,’” he said.On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host covered the aides and officials who have been fired and rehired during Trump’s time in the White House. Before he became president, Trump said he would work hard to employ ferocious and mean people to get the job done. “I have to give Trump credit here,” he said. “He did warn us that he was going to hire some vicious, horrible people and he followed through.”Meyers spoke about Carl Higbie, who was originally hired as the chief of external affairs for the Corporation for National and Community Service – yet fired after hateful comments resurfaced that showed him to be a bigot.Yet despite this, he was ultimately given a job by a pro-Trump group promoting his policy agenda.“So Higbie did something terrible but instead of getting rid of him, they just moved him to a new job,” he said. “To put it in Catholic terms, he got moved to another diocese.”Meyers continued: “The guy who repeatedly said racist things about black people is still on the board that is run by the National Diversity Coalition. That’s like Charlie Sheen teaching D.A.R.E.”Similarly, Trump’s ex-assistant John McAntee was escorted off the White House premises after it was found that he was under investigation for serious financial crimes. Yet he’s now working on Trump’s re-election campaign.“So he got escorted off the White House grounds and into a promotion,” he said. “That’s like getting thrown out of a bar and the bouncer saying, ‘Get out and stay out and then come back tomorrow because you’re the manager now.’”He continued: “Trump keeps recycling these people and others because he only uses one yardstick to measure employees: are they loyal to me? And the problem with that is the kind of people who are unquestionably loyal to an ignorant bigot like Trump are pretty much always terrible people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf5dc38fa82d31bed8658888036ac43e89f2c96c/0_160_5360_3217/master/5360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb06247ce49e5eaf6e9ad1444ccbdddd","title":"ofsted not inspected hundreds schools decade report","story":"Long delay between checks raises concerns that standards may have slipped at many ‘outstanding’ schoolsDoubts have been cast on the quality of some of the country’s most sought-after schools after it emerged that hundreds graded outstanding by Ofsted have not been inspected for more than a decade and their assessments may be out of date.A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed that more than 1,600 schools teaching tens of thousands of pupils had not been inspected for six years or more, and of those, almost 300 had not seen an Ofsted inspector for at least 10 years.The schools watchdog is legally required to re-inspect schools every five years, but those judged outstanding – many of which are grammar schools – are exempt from reinspection. Concerns have thus been raised about the continuing accuracy of the judgments on which many parents base their choice of school. It is the first time the NAO has investigated the schools inspectorate, and its report is highly critical in places, concluding that Ofsted cannot demonstrate that its inspection of schools represents value for money, and does not know whether its inspections are having the intended impact of raising education standards.According to the report, over the last four years, Ofsted failed to meet its statutory target to reinspect schools within five years in 43 cases. In each case Ofsted has offered an explanation. It also failed to meet its own target of reinspecting inadequate schools in 78 cases over the same period.The report, published on Thursday, shows time spent on inspections diminishing and periods between inspections extending. According to Ofsted’s own targets, good schools should be reinspected every three years, but in 201617 this period increased to four years. The maximum time for reinspection of schools graded as “requires improvement” – and therefore in need of closer attention – was extended from two years to 30 months, but 55 schools still waited longer. Ofsted also missed its target of inspecting new schools within two years of opening in 95 cases between 201214 and 20145, and extended the target to three years. As a result, the watchdog has switched from conducting in-depth, comprehensive inspections to a “snapshot” of standards, using a light-touch, risk-focused model of inspection. A good primary school, for example, will be inspected by a single inspector over a day. Resources are concentrated on underperforming schools, leaving high-achieving schools unchecked by routine inspection, as long as data shows that they are maintaining performance.“The length of time without inspection means that some pupils go through primary andor secondary without an independent assessment of their school’s effectiveness,” the report states. “The older an inspection judgment, the greater the risk that it is no longer accurate. This reduces the level of assurance available about the school concerned.”Responding to the report, Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said the organisation was operating in a difficult financial environment. “This means that we have had to make tough decisions about how we prioritise resources. I am confident that Ofsted gets the balance right. For example, by focusing more resource on inspection of schools that are less than good. An increase in either the number of inspections or time spent on inspection will quite simply require greater funding.“Ofsted is only one lever in the school system, which is why it has proven difficult for the NAO to judge our impact and value for money. As we have made clear to the NAO, judging ourselves against school outcomes would inevitably create perverse incentives.”Launching the report, the NAO head Amyas Morse acknowledged Ofsted’s strengths: “Ofsted’s role as an independent inspector is valued by parents, headteachers think its judgements are fair, and it is making headway against recent performance shortfalls.Teachers’ leaders who have long criticised Ofsted welcomed the report as confirmation of their view that Ofsted was not fit for purpose and called on ministers to conduct a root and branch review of the system of holding schools to account.Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The revelation that Ofsted does not know whether its school inspections are having the intended impact, to raise the standards of education and improve the quality of children and young peoples’ lives, is devastating.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We agree with the head of the NAO that cheaper inspection is not necessarily better inspection, and we support the recommendation for a review into whether Ofsted has the resources to do its job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc552774223a7e2c89d97935d4602df6d86b8daf/0_0_2338_1402/master/2338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00cf3b435d159c66b1086284fd6a92d","title":"great british bee count 2018 in pictures","story":"As the fifth annual Great British Bee Count gets under way, wildlife and gardening experts are calling on the public to grow weeds to help Britain’s bees.

A whirlwind first day began on a transatlantic flight and flipped straight from the red eye into a burst of meeting, greeting and looking the part in the newly fitted club suit. For the Spaniard first impressions played a big part in his successful audition for the job and he set about making new ones as he introduced himself. The energy he likes to transmit was on show.Upstairs in the directors’ box lounge at the Emirates Stadium he tried to expand on what makes him tick. It was evident that the way he will communicate with his players is full on. From the way he spoke – making a determined effort to explain himself in English in his clear, booming voice – to the way he amplified his points with expressive gestures, his eyes darting briskly around the room to try not to miss anything, Emery will be an altogether different kind of presence around the squad. Arsène Wenger tended to be more cerebral, more observant, more about guiding someone than pushing him.Emery’s brand of charisma comes across as animated, spirited and direct.“I think the most important thing is to connect with people and have those personal relationships,” Emery said. “Heart to heart, head to head. The heart transmits emotion, the head transmits the intelligence. So it’s really important to have that connection both on a personal and collective level. What you are looking for is a shared experience. It’s true that you get the famous egos in football but that is true of top players and players who are not so good. I’m a coach that has come from second ision, gone through to the first ision, coached at PSG and now at Arsenal. And really the essence of it all is people.”Emery has begun to study the personalities he will begin to work with over the summer. Arsenal are not overly represented at the World Cup, so he will soon be trying to make those connections with a large proportion of the squad, the vehicle through which he will introduce his philosophy. While paying due respect to the “love for possession” he saw as part of the club’s heritage, he also stresses how his football ideal is also about intensity and pressing.That is another departure from Wenger’s focus on expression with the ball and it will be interesting to see how quickly Emery can effect a stylistic transformation. “I like to win the ball back as quickly as possible,” he said. “It’s about two things: possession and pressing.“Football is a demanding and difficult sport. What we want to do is not fear any team, either here in the Premier League or in Europe, and our objective is to be among the best and to beat the best. I’m the type of coach who has always worked really hard – not because I do it better than anyone else but because that is what I believe the most important thing is.” He talked about “that desire to be better” like a kind of compulsion, adding: “I’ve never seen anything handed out for free in football.”The 46-year-old looked effortlessly relaxed and confident in himself. He had that air of being comfortable in his own skin that comes with having the balance of experience and motivation to feel sure he can do this job well. When Wenger started at Arsenal (at the same age Emery is now) he described himself as “full of hope, full of belief as well” and Emery emits the same vibes.For all the revolution that began when Arsenal last appointed a new manager 22 years ago, a rarity in bringing a foreign manager into the English game, this announcement was a snapshot of how the football landscape has changed. It was an entirely international affair. In London Arsenal were introduced to a man from the Basque country who had been interviewed by a panel of football executives from South Africa, Germany and Spain, having impressed an American owner, to be shown around a stadium named after a Middle Eastern airline on the day the club unveiled record-breaking shirt sleeve sponsors from Rwanda.Emery took it all in his steady stride. He had been in contact with the Arsenal hierarchy while in charge of Paris Saint-Germain, attending the first interview two days after the French Cup final and with two Ligue 1 games remaining (nothing untoward as his departure from the Parc des Princes had been sealed and made public). The three big meetings he had with Arsenal went from strength to strength, making him the unanimous choice. His blend of personality and pedigree, and a willingness to work collaboratively with the head honchos, shone through. Emery has a load more meetings in the diary for the rest of this week where backroom staff and aims for the transfer window are on the agenda.For all Ivan Gazidis’s talk of a new structure with shared responsibility Emery undoubtedly carries the status of Arsenal’s new figurehead. Out with hashtag MerciArsène and in with WelcomeUnai. There were sudden changes made around the place, making sure the lifesize cutout of Wenger that had been in the tunnel was taken down in time for this unveiling and Emery’s brushed steel nameplate erected outside the head coach’s office. Over to the new man in town to show what he is made of."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7d4184da16db822c94e6b752f632cf444e13c3/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b0718305133404facfd333c04ed2ce","title":"while the city sleeps london after hours a photo essay","story":"Photographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensPhotographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensIn the changing rooms backstage at Proud Cabaret in London, half a dozen performers are crammed together preparing themselves for the evening’s shows. As one liberally applies eye makeup, another fills the air with a cloud of hairspray. There are nipple tassels, high heels, leather and wigs. It’s 8pm and the night is about to begin.“There’s always a buzzing atmosphere while everyone prepares for the doors to open,” says Fiona Jay-Brown, one half of the acrobatic duo Deux Ailes. “There are a lot of performers so it does get very busy backstage but we all do our best to get the show on the road. There’s rarely a backstage panic. Whether it’s missing tit-tape or hairspray running out, we all help each other out.”Over at the Houses of Parliament, the scene is quiet and the politicians are long gone. Fire officers Eddie Brennan and Paul Chambers sweep through the House of Lords, past the empty benches, along more than three miles of corridors and down into the bowels of the famous structure, patrolling for potential fire hazards.“It’s a world heritage-listed building and I don’t want to go down as the next Guy Fawkes!” quips Brennan.Drawn from the London Fire Brigade, Brennan and his colleagues oversee numerous government buildings in the area. This past year they have investigated more than 200 alarms and reports of fire “but, touch wood, we haven’t had to fully evacuate the palace in the four years I’ve been working here,” he says.Much of the current palace was built following the devastating fire of 1834. The architect, Charles Barry, used brick, stone and iron to try to minimise the risks of another catastrophe but in the interiors he and Augustus Pugin used vast quantities of highly flammable materials.That said, Brennan notes that people present the greatest risk. “You’ve got people laying data cables next to old plumbing and it’s all out of sight, out of mind you find people propping the fire doors open and forgetting to switch off stoves and heaters and lamps. Even after the latest round of modifications, the palace will always be vulnerable to fire.”Further down the river, another London landmark, Tower Bridge, is also staffed at night. The bridge is raised around 850 times a year for registered vessels with a mast or superstructure of nine metres or more.Tower Bridge was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built when it was finished in 1894. The lifting mechanism was originally operated using steam to power the enormous pumping engines these days the hydraulics are driven by oil and electricity while the upper walkway – now a function space with a glass floor offering views directly over the Thames – is lit in vivid pink.With the roads relatively free of congestion, Transport for London begins night maintenance work at the Upper Thames Street tunnel. Opened in 1970, approximately 40,000 vehicles and 4,000 cyclists travel through the half-mile long tunnel every day.“We have only one opportunity every three months to close the tunnel and carry out all repairs, maintenance and cleaning for the next three,” says Stewart Wilson, Asset Operations Manager. “You really feel the pressure when you have a dozen jobs that all need to be carried out at once, before the tunnel reopens.”Westminster has become a European hotspot for homelessness, with more and more people moving to the heart of London in search of hope, opportunity and support. By nightfall, not all have managed to get a roof over their heads.The Connection at St Martin’s, next to Trafalgar Square, provides help for approximately 4,500 people a year its night centre accommodates up to 45 people every night – or more during severe weather – on a short-stay basis.“Most of our clients have complex issues so our approach is to help them deal with trauma and help them to gain independence and get their confidence back,” says The Connection’s night centre manager, Paul Symonds.“They’re really relieved to get indoors at night, to have a nutritious hot meal and to get their heads down. It’s like a pool of tranquility while you’re surrounded by the bright lights and madness of central London.”Symonds adds: “You meet the most interesting characters you could ever hope to meet – that’s the joy of the job. I’ve always felt it a privilege really.“We do have our challenging moments with people dealing with addiction and mental health, but generally it’s very fulfilling.”“London can be rough when you’re on the streets. I’ve had some good times, I’ve had some bad times,” says Ken, one of the residents.“You’ve got to understand that to get into The Connection you’ve got to spend at least four nights on the street. They’ve got to see you sleeping out. There are people who’ve been out a lot longer than that, though. At least here you’ve got a bunk and the staff are quite helpful.”While London sleeps, Spitalfields night market comes alive with traders buying and selling goods. Around 750,000 tonnes of produce passes through the market each year and is shifted by 233 forklifts and about 2,000 employees.The market has been on its present 32-acre site near Hackney Wick since 1992 though its royal charter dates back to 1682 when Charles II granted permission for a twice-weekly market for flesh, fowl and roots.Peter Durber began trading at the market in 1983. “It’s still busy and bustling but it’s evolved to be a very different market over the years,” he says. “It was predominantly white trade with Jewish influence but now there’s a very large ethnic influence which has kept it alive and reflects the ersity of London.”Durber works 12 hours, six nights a week, starting at 3am. “Any sane person would look at the hours we work and think we’re all crazy,” he says. “It’s a bit of a beast but I enjoy what I do and when you have a buzz and you enjoy what you do, the time goes very quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/845024883b316ad6d511b650265c74f2d6e401d7/0_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce724c20e07650068e359fa43fe77d0b","title":"western consumers fund extremism by buying talcum powder claims study","story":"Talc used in products sold in Europe and the US is often mined in Afghanistan by Isis and the Taliban, finds reportIslamic State and the Taliban are engaged in a bitter battle over control of mines in Afghanistan that supply much of the talcum used by European and US consumers.The mineral, used in everything from baby powder and cosmetics to paint and car parts, is mined in areas of eastern Afghanistanwhere the Taliban and Islamic State in Afghanistan are vying for supremacy.The struggle to control the extraction of talc and other minerals, such as chromite, has been exposed in a new report by Global Witness. The campaign group has spent months investigating how the murky trade means western consumers are effectively supporting insurgents in the country. Nick Donovan, campaign director for Global Witness, said that while talc lacked the imaginative allure of blood diamonds, which have featured in Hollywoods films and global rap music hits, it was nonetheless a “blood mineral”.“This report shows the insidious way in which insurgents have become involved in talc mining and the threat of groups like Isis becoming more involved,” said Donovan.He added that, while the Taliban’s involvement in talc mining is now well established, the move by the Afghan branch of Isis into mining the mineral appeared to follow a pattern whereby the group attempts to seize and exploit resources as a way of funding its efforts. The trend has been particularly marked in Iraq and Syria, where the group has moved into crude oil refining.According to the report, Isis in Afghanistan now controls large talc, marble and chromite mines in eastern Afghanistan, particularly around their stronghold in Achin district in Nangarhar province, the same area where the US military dropped the “mother of all bombs” against Isis-held caves in April 2017.Several sources interviewed for the report said significant mining has taken place under Isis since they took control. The group has fought major battles with the Taliban over neighbouring districts containing even richer deposits.One former security source told researchers they believed Isis had been involved in trying to construct a road to Pakistan to export minerals from areas controlled by the group.“The Islamic State appears to have a significant strategic interest in Afghanistan’s minerals and controls some major mining areas,” said Donovan. “Given its track record of exploiting natural resources in Iraq and Syria, this should be a wake-up call for both the Afghan government and the Trump administration.“They must strengthen control over the trade in places like Nangarhar, but just as importantly put in place desperately needed transparency and oversight reforms so that legitimate mining has a chance to provide a viable alternative.”The findings of the Global Witness investigation follow research suggesting that the Taliban is making millions annually from talc as part of the estimated $300m (£225m) a year they rake in from minerals across Afghanistan. Almost all of Afghanistan’s talc is exported to Pakistan, said the report, which in turn exports more of it to the US than to any other country. Pakistan provides more than a third of US imports of talc, with EU countries also major buyers. “Unwitting American and European consumers are inadvertently helping fund extremist groups in Afghanistan,” said Donovan, adding that a ban on the talc trade in Afghanistan, imposed in early 2015, had been weakly enforced – not least because of the involvement of political figures in the trade.

I was particularly drawn to the compact evergreen cultivar Euphorbia ‘Black Pearl’ in Chris Beardshaw’s Morgan Stanley garden, although I also spotted architectural caper spurge (E. lathyris, often maligned as a weed), bright-yellow-flowered Wallich spurge (E. wallichii) and lime-yellow cushion spurge (E. epithymoides) all over the showground.2 Fancy giving room to the prehistoric-looking black-ribbed stalks of scouring rush (Equisetum hyemale), which popped up in a couple of Chelsea gardens this year? Don’t be put off because it’s a relative of the horribly invasive weed horsetail: this is a brilliant low-maintenance architectural plant that loves swampy spots and pond edges. It was shown off to good effect in Nic Howard’s garden, set against a simple charcoal-grey wall and softened with Mexican fleabane (Erigeron karvinskianus). Stuart Towner paired it with Hosta ‘Devon Green’, Japanese forest grass (Hakonechloa macra), Gunnera magellanica and European wild ginger (Asarum europaeum). Scouring rush will spread relentlessly if given free rein, so contain it in a trough or water feature.3 If you are looking for low-maintenance, low-cost alternatives to paving your front garden, gravel has much to recommend it, and at this year’s Chelsea several gardens took this theme in different directions. Sarah Price showed how to use a Mediterranean plant palette with the papery pink flowers of the Cretan rockrose (Cistus creticus) and the vivid red flower clusters of the blood pink (Dianthus cruentus). Gravel’s also a good mulch for shade planting: see Nic Howard’s row of the huge (and thankfully slug-resistant) leaves of Hosta ‘Sum and Substance’ planted in gravel along a narrow bed that would work perfectly in a gloomy side return.4 If I was in any doubt about the rise of the houseplant, the visitors swarming over the displays of cacti, succulents and orchids in the Great Pavilion were proof of their staying power. It’s not only because these plants are so Instagrammable – Popsy the Cactus from Craig House Cacti is now so popular she has her own Twitter account – but because for many of us without much outside space, an air plant or two is a far more realistic prospect. A collaboration between Ikea and Indoor Garden Design offers clever ways to display plants indoors, from space-saving hanging planters to planters on peg boards. You’ll see houseplants creeping into show gardens, too, from the blue chalksticks succulent (Senecio serpens) in Sarah Price’s garden to the cast-iron plants (Aspidistra elatior) dotted through Stuart Towner’s garden.5 Want garden furniture that will never require repainting and doesn’t need covering in winter? What about a slab of rock? Jo Thompson’s show garden for Wedgwood shows how it’s done, with flat-topped chunks of York stone serving as chair or table or both simply add a comfy cushion or blanket. Just make sure you think carefully about where to position them, as you won’t be able to move them easily. If you’re more of a wood type, take the lead from Nic Howard, whose garden seats are simple cubes of oak, charred and shaped to make the perfect resting spot.6 If summer bedding leaves you cold, try planting up containers with succulents instead. The Pearlfisher garden cleverly employed echeverias, kalanchoes, sedums, crassulas and the like to mimic an underwater scene, while communicating its message about the perils of marine plastic pollution. The key to success is a very free-draining growing medium (use cactus and succulent compost, and choose a pot with plenty of holes in the bottom) and the sunniest spot you can muster. Remember to bring them inside to a frost-free place once summer starts to fade.7 It may be the flower show, but some gardens demonstrated that big and bold foliage can offer as much impact. Stuart Towner’s Spirit of Cornwall garden is a masterclass in combining different shapes and textures to create a big-leaved border, using the palmate-leaved false castor oil plant (Fatsia japonica), the pleated leaves of rodgersias and the huge corrugated leaves of Chilean rhubarb (Gunnera manicata). If you want a really unusual bold-leaved foliage shrub for your garden, get your hands on a spikenard (Aralia cordata), as shown off by Tom Stuart-Smith in his Weston garden in the Great Pavilion.8 Bare concrete in a garden is usually shorthand for something ugly and municipal, but this year’s Chelsea shows how to use this material in an inspired way, from the concrete cubes that break up frothy planting in Robert Barker’s Skin Deep conceptual garden to Stuart Towner’s simple oval concrete patio in his Spirit of Cornwall garden. Just make sure the lines are clean, the finish professional and the planting abundant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e730e9f257d4d40f6443f7cc8896d2818f9ba5/0_460_5436_3262/master/5436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e95d1d2ba22e38f46d394ae9f87e5e","title":"ditch the tin foil and channel yotam ottolenghi how to enjoy eating outdoors","story":"From flying insects to the weather, Mother Nature can be a cruel mistress. Here’s how to master British summer picnics and barbecues and realise your alfresco dining fantasies The simple pleasures of dining alfresco are a well-worn topic at this time of year: it is hardly news that food tastes better in the open air, even if it is more likely to be our appreciation, rather than our perception of flavour, that is enhanced by the novel surroundings of a cliff top, a sailing dinghy or even a park bench.Indeed, although the rustic romance of un déjeuner sur l’herbe has inspired writers and painters for centuries, the picturesque results tend to be heavily seasoned with artistic licence. No wasps hang around the fruit basket in Manet’s painting and nary a seagull e-bombs the bread and cheese as Virginia Woolf’s fractious family finally make their voyage to the lighthouse. If the Famous Five’s tinned sardines ever leaked fishy oil all over the rug, I don’t remember it, while Renoir’s boating party seem bizarrely untroubled by the distinct possibility that the small dog on the table will upset their wine glasses.These are fantasies of alfresco life, but in truth Mother Nature is a cruel mistress who doesn’t give a fig for your carefully laid plans or meticulously sliced cucumber sandwiches – which is why it pays to come prepared for all eventualities. Here’s a guide to dealing with a few of the challenges likely to crop up as soon as the words “it’s a lovely day!” leave your mouth.These days, most special diets are easy to cater for with a little notice – but when someone texts on the day to inform you they have gone plant-based, or gluten-free, it can be tempting to reply telling them to bring their own bloody lunch. Before you do, count to 10 and channel Yotam Ottolenghi: a Middle Eastern feast will keep everyone happy. Big bowls of hummus or baba ganoush, paired with a salad of roasted or barbecued veg and some falafel or vegetable fritters are sure to go down a treat with omnivores, too – add pitta or other flatbreads to bulk it out, then finish with fruit and meringues or damp, sticky polenta cake. Most of these are gluten free and can easily be made vegan too. Failing that, almost all supermarkets carry a wide range of free-from products – and everyone likes crisps, right?Even the most committed animal lover might be hard-pressed to welcome our flying friends to the feast – but if you are eating outside, a certain insect presence is inevitable to be fair to them, it’s where they live. The best way of deterring wasps and bees is thought to be to trap the first inquisitive scout before it returns to the nest weighed down with ketchup and alerts 250 of its nearest and dearest to the free buffet going on in your back garden. Avoid setting up camp close to ponds or the standing water beloved of mozzies and midges instead, embrace the fresh air of a breezy hilltop – most flying insects hate both wind and smoke, which is a great excuse for a barbecue or a campfire.The crunch of sand between the teeth may seem as inevitable a part of eating on the beach as a stiff wind and a Mr Whippy for pudding, but there are ways to reduce your silica consumption. Go for food such as wraps, filled baguettes and oranges that can be eaten straight from their wrappers (see below for eco-friendly options) with minimal contact with the gritty environment. Make sure you rinse your hands, preferably with fresh water, before you even think of unpacking anything, although even a bucket of sea water is better than nothing.Obviously, sun is welcome whether you are planning a barbie in the back garden or a celebratory drink at the top of a mountain, but it can be problematic keeping food fresh in the heat. A good rule of thumb is to choose dishes from warmer climes: cured salami and ham are more robust than poached salmon or coronation chicken, just as parmesan, manchego or feta will do better than cheddar or stilton in sunshine. (That said, if you are eating at home, or can keep them flat in transit, bries, camemberts and their ilk come into their own after a few hours outside the fridge.) Crunchy carrots and radishes and Mediterranean veg are preferable to leafy greens, and vinaigrettes tend to hold up better than mayonnaise in high temperatures. If you are making sandwiches ahead of time, consider replacing the butter with avocado mashed with lemon juice, or a soft cheese.This is more likely to be a problem in the UK than sun, sadly – but all is not lost if the forecast begins to look grim one of the best picnics I have ever eaten was consumed in the very damp shadow of a dry-stone wall on Scafell Pike in December. As on a beach, choose foods that can be eaten straight from the wrappers, and avoid soft bread or delicate pastry: you’d be surprised how water-repellent a pork pie or scotch egg is compared with your average loaf of sliced white. If you are taking advantage of a brief break in the clouds to picnic, pack a waterproof layer to protect the rug, and your bottoms, from soggy grass. If the forecast looks similarly grim for a long-planned barbecue and you cannot fit the grill under cover, or prop a well-weighted umbrella over it, then go for dishes such as jerk chicken or ribs, which can be cooked in advance and then finished off either on a grill or a hot pan, depending on how the sky is looking, or choose recipes that work in the oven as well as on the barbecue.If you are planning to eat a few hundred yards from your own kitchen, I probably do not need to tell you that a tray will come in handy. For picnics at distant beauty spots and barbecues on the beach, however, it pays to consider the very unromantic question of logistics. Some foods travel better than others exquisite Parisian pastries will not look quite so pretty once they have been carted up a hill, but a sturdy British pie with a hot water crust could probably be kicked up there without much damage. Hard cheeses, cooked meats, boiled eggs and crunchy pickles are all good choices, as are soft things such as hummus or potato salad, which won’t mind being shaken about a bit. If you must take ripe tomatoes or stone fruits, then wrap them in newspaper as carefully as fine china, and put them in storage boxes. Cold drinks can be happily decanted into Thermos flasks full of ice.One of the chief pleasures of picnics in particular is their simplicity: unless physical necessity demands it, this is not the time for tables and chairs. Much lovelier to lounge about on the grass, sand or a sun-warmed rock and feel at one with nature as you shovel Pringles into your gob. In reality, all of those surfaces can be prickly, damp or downright spiky – so if you can manage to lug along a stout, preferably waterproof rug as well as the food, all the better (a sheet of plastic, or a few large Ikea bags, underneath an ordinary rug, does the job just as well). If you are planning to sit for a while, you might also like to suggest each guest brings a cushion as head support for an eminently sensible postprandial nap, and consider bringing a parasol as a sunshade: though a hat apiece is considerably easier to carry. Proper cloth napkins not only give a picnic an air of sophistication but are much more useful than paper ones, which tend to disintegrate at the mere sight of mayonnaise – and, of course, they are endlessly reusable, as well as handy for wrapping any crockery, glasses, boiled eggs and so on.As above, if you are eating away from home, keep it simple. Go for finger food – crudités and dips, burgers, hot dogs or samosas – and all you need are napkins to wipe your hands afterwards, although a bottle opener is sure to come in useful at most British picnics, as will some beakers. (Unless you want to be lugging those around yourself, ask everyone to bring their own – it will save on the washing up too.) If you are planning to barbecue away from home, invest in a small portable grill rather than wasteful disposable ones: some models are hardly more expensive, and you will be able to enjoy them for many summers to come. Barbecues will never be the most eco-friendly option of course, but you can also help by fuelling them with sustainable British lumpwood charcoal.Naturally, this should be kept to a minimum – principally for environmental reasons, although aesthetically there is little to spoil the simple elegance of a picnic like outrageous amounts of plastic wrap strewn across the rug. This should not be a problem if you are making the food yourself: there are plenty of good eco-friendly options out there, from sandwich wraps to Indian tiffin boxes, which are not only reusable, but far easier on the eye than tin foil, and a lot better at their job as well. Unless you are feeding the 5,000, you may prefer to decant condiments and seasonings into small jars (I collect tiny jam jars from hotel breakfasts for the purpose), though always leave dressing salads and sandwiches until the last minute, if possible, to minimise the risk of things going soggy and slimy in transit.In theory, without all that rubbish to deal with, this should be relatively painless: box up any leftovers for tomorrow’s lunch, then sluice out dirty containers with water if it is available and going spare, and roughly dry with the aforementioned napkins before packing away. It’s always a good idea to take a couple of bags for any disposable packaging and recycling you do manage to accumulate, and if you are likely to be somewhere without water, a few damp flannels in a waterproof washbag will be invaluable for cleaning hands and faces before you release any trapped wasps, shake out the rug and head home, smug in the knowledge you have done your patriotic duty by the great British summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee007c78e9aeed218f7d0da4be670670a6063a7c/0_277_5189_3113/master/5189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=693bd2ba504e41e1ab1154994ba89f47","title":"natalie lee joes recipe for pork tonkatsu sando","story":"This fried pork cutlet sandwich is a bit naughty, super tasty and the perfect late-night indulgencePork tonkatsu sando – fried breaded pork cutlet in a sandwich – is something I\u0026nbsplove cooking when I get home late at night.

The dispute has been settled without admission of fault.Maltby is understood to have been prepared to go to court over the claims made in the Pierce article and any court case could have involved No 10 staff and senior members of the Conservative party being called to give evidence.Her original claim against Green, that he hinted he could advance her career in exchange for an affair, was judged “plausible” by a Cabinet Office inquiry. However, Green ultimately lost his job after admitting that he had lied about the fact that pornography was found on his parliamentary computer during a police investigation in 2008.The inquiry also examined claims that Green or his allies influenced the Mail article, which called Maltby “one very pushy lady”. Green and his aides have strongly denied they contributed in any way to the attacks on Maltby.In her original piece for the Times, which prompted the inquiry, Maltby said Green had fleetingly touched her knee during a meeting in a Waterloo pub in 2015 to talk about her political career, as he mentioned that his own wife was “very understanding”.Maltby, who writes regularly for the Times, said Green also sent her a suggestive text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper. In his resignation letter, Green said he did not recognise the events Maltby described in her article, “but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and for this I apologise”.Maltby told the : “Like many of the women who’ve spoken this year about abuse of power, I only felt able to speak publicly about inappropriate behaviour at Westminster because I had a strong media platform and was lucky enough to be able to afford legal representation.Samantha Rennie, executive director at Rosa, the UK-wide fund which manages the Time’s Up fund, welcomed Maltby’s £5,500 donation. “We can’t end the culture of impunity without generous people like Kate who inspire others to give,” she said. “Grants from the Justice and Equality Fund will be made to support organisations with a track record of success in tackling harassment and abuse, and of supporting people who have suffered it.”Maltby said the fund would “particularly focus on those less privileged … working-class women, women of colour, and those with other intersecting disadvantages” who were less able to face the brunt of harassment in the workplace.“It’s not enough for prominent white women to speak out against harassment from our relative safety. It is essential that we give tangible financial support to women who take greater financial risks in challenging power,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83db94297a0585413cba4ff308fc3a07f875ff95/48_219_2422_1453/master/2422.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ced6e2d3c5ab323d845570eb4af9498b","title":"britten sinfonia ades review gerald barry barbican london nicolas hodges","story":"In Barry’s words, his piece is more like a play or opera than a concerto. It’s a noisy dialogue between piano and the rest, the anatomy of an argument. It opens with a challenge from the brass – the trumpets are the ringleaders, the horns their sidekicks. The piano answers with self-assurance mixed with irritation and, while it might seem an unequal fight, the soloist has many weapons. These include not only force – at times the soloist hits clusters of notes with both forearms – but also smug certainty, which comes through in a passage that sounds almost like a five-finger exercise, travelling baldly up the keyboard and down again. You can almost hear the hot air – literally at times, when the wind machines on either side of the percussion section let rip. Flippant, cool and histrionic, it’s typical Barry, and initially at least it’s fun to hear but as response follows statement follows response it becomes wearing. This argument takes a long time to be fought through, and when at the end the piano is left alone repeating a little quiet figure to itself – a winner’s loneliness – it’s the first moment of real depth.Beethoven’s Symphony No 4, which opened the concert, peaked in the slow movement, the violins spinning their melodies into almost impossibly long threads. The finale, however, was a little heavy-handed there are passages in this movement that should perhaps be conducted with only a single eyebrow, and Adès’s energetic direction didn’t achieve that kind of nonchalance. His reading of No 5, however, was a winner – impatient yet disciplined, histrionic yet lyrical, it stressed the elements Beethoven and Barry share, and found resolution for all of them, ending the concert in triumphant exuberance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d541f24b86ec7161e0bb661981bf9f097f4811/0_61_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a8c4906325001f2dc8ede42ad074906","title":"rolling stones review london stadium jagger","story":"London StadiumThere are ragged moments – a shaky Under My Thumb, a leaden Paint It Black – but plenty of others where Jagger and co achieve liftoffIt is 37 years since the Rolling Stones more or less singlehandedly invented the latterday mega-tour. Huge artists had toured huge sports arenas before the Stones’ 1981 jaunt around the US, but not on that scale, not with that profit, and not with corporate sponsorship – courtesy of Jōvan Musk, an aftershave one suspects Mick Jagger was no more likely to wear than he was to spray himself with manure. There were also pay-per-view tie-ins and the early 80s equivalent of live streaming to cinemas: all the stuff one now expects when the rock aristocracy hit the road.The best part of four decades on, with umpteen tours that make their 1981 outing look like the apotheosis of understatement, you might imagine the Stones’ stadium show to be a thing of perfectly-drilled slickness. In a sense, it is. You get a lot of what you might expect to get at a Rolling Stones show in London, from Mick Jagger reminiscing about a long-lost local venue, Dalston Baths (or, as he puts it, “a place near ear called Dalston Barfs”), to footage on the big screens that evokes their past – when they were Britain’s premiere exponents of tough Chicago blues. And there’s the way the rock-solid drumming of Charlie Watts is augmented by the various facial expressions of Charlie Watts, every one of which somehow communicates that this nonsense is all a bit beneath him.But in a sense it isn’t slick at all. “Well, we made it frew,” sighs Jagger after a shaky version of Under My Thumb, a song he suggests the band play rarely these days, for obvious reasons. It displays what you might tactfully call an attitude to male-female relations that hails from a different era – but which the public have apparently voted they return to their set, in an online poll. Jagger himself sounds in pretty good shape for a man of 74, the only evidence of time’s passage on his voice is when he drops out of the falsetto in Fool to Cry. But said shakiness is what’s really gripping about the Stones live. Performing without the safety net of backing tracks – as much a part of the mega-tour these days as sponsorship deals – the band still occasionally feel shambolic, as if they’re just clinging on to the song by their fingernails: a ragged version of Street Fighting Man, a leaden plod through Paint It Black that carries none of the original version’s amphetamine paranoia. And then there are moments when everything suddenly gels and they achieve liftoff. Tonight, it happens first during Ride ’Em on Down, one of the old blues numbers they resurrected for 2016’s Blue and Lonesome – even though an audience here for the hits react to its announcement as if Jagger’s just informed them where the nearest lavatory is – and then again during Sympathy for the Devil, which kicks off a ferocious home run of songs. Miss You sounds suitably humid and intense Midnight Rambler rages along, its nastiness fully intact. You’re struck by the sense that they probably sounded not unlike this back in Dalston Barfs, flaws and all.In a world of stadium rock shows where every note seems perfectly choreographed and nothing is left to chance, it’s authentically thrilling and raw. The Rolling Stones have still, to borrow their old phrase, got live if you want it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8f453bbabce282b32c23ba7c8c7fab189e431b/0_0_3000_1910/master/3000.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=83abb1ae8ae15d07e6b70951116054a8 1320w","title":"all future labour peers must back abolition of lords says corbyn","story":"Corbyn is first recent Labour leader to make voting for abolition of upper chamber a condition for appointment of new peersJeremy Corbyn has said any new peers appointed by his party must support Labour’s position of abolishing the House of Lords if ever offered a parliamentary vote on its future.The Labour leader, a long-time advocate of replacing the upper house with an elected chamber, has already made the pledge a condition for the appointment of three new peers announced on Friday.The government can create new peers whenever it likes. But there are a few conventions, agreed between all the parties, and all nominations for a peerage have to be approved. Tax dodging and criminal convictions usually rule out appointment. Outgoing prime ministers often reward old chums with a peerage. Occasionally an MP is propelled into the Lords to create a spare seat in the Commons. By recent custom, peers are created without shifting the balance of power from no overall control.No, and famously the Lords is the second biggest legislative chamber after China’s national people’s congress. It has 750 members, of whom 150 or so inherited their titles. When one dies there is an election among other hereditaries in the same party. When the Lib Dem peer Lord Avebury died, an electorate of three voted for his successor. Efforts at shrinking it have led to a retirement scheme but not much else.Most democratic countries have an elected second chamber, if they have a second chamber at all. Some have a mix of appointed and elected. Efforts to reform the house of lords have foundered on disagreement on questions of scale - how big, what proportion should be elected and on what basis - first past the post, single transferable vote, alternative vote … a fresh start would make almost anything possible.\u0026nbsp One idea gaining traction is that it should represent the United Kingdom, bringing together England, Scotland, northern Ireland and Wales in a kind of federal body. But the most contentious question is always whether an elected second chamber would have more powers, which would weaken the House of CommonsThe trio of new peers, former Labour party general secretary Iain McNicol, campaigner Martha Osamor and socialist writer Pauline Bryan, have all signed up to the principle of replacing the Lords with a new, more democratic model. Senior Labour figures suggested the move was “well past overdue” and that transforming the House of Lords must take place to address the democratic deficit. Corbyn said: “It is a democratic necessity to abolish the unelected and outdated House of Lords and replace it with an elected second chamber. “We cannot continue to let political insiders, who the public can’t get rid of, have so much influence over our country’s laws. The next Labour government will renew our democracy and take power back from out-of-touch elites.” Party insiders suggested that Corbyn had been reluctant to appoint any new peers but was concerned that Labour could be at a disadvantage as Theresa May unveiled nine of her own on the same day.“While it exists, it is important that we have the strongest Labour voice there to make sure that the government is held to account and to make sure that Labour priorities are pushed as strongly as they can be,” the spokesman said. One of those new peers, Bryan, wrote on a blog for the RedRobin website: “I was asked to accept a nomination on the basis that a) I would take it on as a job and work with the Labour team b) that when the opportunity arose I would vote for its abolition. It was also important that I was from outside the London bubble.” Corbyn has only nominated four people for Labour peerages since he became leader in 2016. Frontbencher Shami Chakrabarti was the only Labour peer to be named as part of David Cameron’s resignation honours. He is the first recent Labour leader to make voting for abolition of the Lords a condition of a peer’s appointment.His spokesman’s comments appear to go further than Labour’s manifesto, which said that while the party’s “fundamental” belief was that the second chamber should be elected, in the meantime it would seek to end the hereditary principle and reduce the size of the existing chamber.Theresa May recently appointed nine new peers including former MPs and ministers, despite previously saying she was committed to “restraint” in handing them out. At prime minister’s questions, the SNP’s Pete Wishart said the latest increase in the numbers of peers, bringing the total to more than 800, was “cynical” and a “complete fix” after the Tories lost 15 key Brexit votes in the House of Lords. Labour also suffered a major rebellion when more than 80 of the party’s peers supported a plan, against the leadership’s will, to keep Britain in the single market. However, May’s spokesman defended the announcement, which came on the eve of the royal wedding. “We have been clear that there should be restraint on new appointments in the Lords, combined with an increased cross-party take up of retirements,” he said.“The prime minister has made clear that she will operate on the basis that there will no longer be an automatic entitlement of a peerage for any holder of high office in public life. The total size of the Lords has fallen since she took office.“The nominations reflect our determination that the House of Lords should contain people from various walks of life but also people who have expertise that can add to the overall contribution the house makes. I think that’s reflected in the list of nominations that you saw last week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb89f5721d7cf72579d23105ccf49f3b6c9bab7b/0_39_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef01df5fabf42e239986e4bee720eadd","title":"brexiters customs model could cost 20bn for uk business","story":"‘Max-fac’ option could result in huge annual hit for firms, according to head of HMRCThe post-Brexit customs model favoured by Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and Michael Gove could cost business as much as £20bn a year, the head of HMRC has said, a verdict that delivers a huge blow to the Brexiters’ hopes of a complete departure from the customs union. Jon Thompson told the Treasury select committee that their preferred “max-fac” model, which relies on technology and trusted trader schemes to minimise border checks, would be substantially more expensive than the alternative. Cabinet sources claimed that they had never been briefed by HMRC that the cost could be so high. The huge figure, which represents around double the UK’s annual net contribution to the EU, sent shockwaves around Westminster. Theresa May’s preferred option, the customs partnership model, under which the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, would be virtually cost-free because businesses could claim back the levies, Thompson said. The prime minister has faced veiled threats from leading Brexiters including Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg in recent days to drop the partnership model and press ahead with their max-fac option instead.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.The issue has split both her cabinet and the wider Conservative party, with May forced to ide her cabinet into two groups to fight out their differences over Britain’s post-Brexit customs arrangements. Both options have already been dismissed by Brussels as “fantasy-island, unicorn” models. Brexiters have warned that a third “backstop” option, agreed by the cabinet last week in case the Irish border issue is not resolved speedily, must remain in place only for a short time, fearing that it could be a back-door means of keeping Britain tied to the EU indefinitely. Some in Westminster believe if Brussels accepts the UK’s alternative plan, which would keep Britain aligned with elements of the single market and customs union if no other agreement is reached, it could become the post-Brexit norm. However, there have been reports that Brussels might reject it. Downing Street played down the the HMRC’s £20bn estimate. May’s official spokesman said: “The prime minister has asked for work to be done on both customs models. That work is ongoing and therefore any speculation about implementation is just that.”However, Thompson told MPs that max fac would force firms to draw up UK customs declarations at £32.50 a time, while there would be similar charges on the EU side of the border. Rule-of-origin protections for particular products, such as Melton Mowbray pork pies, would mean higher charges still.“So you need to think about the highly streamlined customs arrangement costing businesses somewhere in the late teens of billions of pounds, somewhere between £17bn and £20bn,” he said. “The primary driver here is the fact that there are customs declarations.”The HMRC chief said there were approximately 200m intra-EU consignments made by firms each year, according to figures checked by the National Audit Office. The customs partnership model, by comparison, would in theory allow goods to cross the border without the need for comprehensive checks, which would be significantly more economical for businesses. They could expect to pay a maximum of £3.4bn a year in total, he told MPs, although in reality it could be “a net cost of zero or less, depending on the tariffs drawn up by the UK and Brussels, because businesses could claim them back”. The Treasury committee chair, Nicky Morgan, summarising the potential costs of the max-fac arrangements, asked Thompson whether it would be a relief if parliament voted for a customs union. He said it was for MPs to decide. Tory Brexiter Bim Afolami MP said the figures should give ministers pause for thought. “Leaving the customs union is the right policy, but whatever the solution we come up with must not be hugely costly and burdensome to British business. That would not be a good outcome,” he said.Thompson also said it would take between three to five years to begin implementing the UK’s new customs arrangements, depending on which of the two options were decided upon by the government. While they would be unable to begin putting them in place until a decision was made, he insisted that the UK border would still continue to operate from the moment Britain left the EU. However, he admitted that such a border might not be “fully optimal”.Even so, there could be issues posed by the land border in Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic. “There is a design challenge for us,” he said. “If you look around the world, even the most technologically advanced customs borders generally involve some kind of infrastructure,” he said.A No 10 spokesman said: “We have been clear on a number of occasions that our intention is to be ready by the end of the implementation period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d85c9dd1efd98d63e39ac1131df624a69565db3d/0_243_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6915ec2cb5a1d9a0f7917c4bbf170c90","title":"eu split exclusion uk galileo brexit","story":"France, Spain, Sweden and Netherlands among countries wishing to retain close ties on GPS systemDivisions are emerging within the EU over the European commission’s decision to exclude the UK from the bloc’s new satellite navigation system, Galileo. A number of member states are said by sources in Brussels to have become sympathetic to the British cause regarding the handling of the issue by EU officials.The commission decided last year to exclude Britain and its companies from sensitive future work on the Galileo satellite project without warning, in what EU sources have described as a “peremptory manner”.Galileo is the £8bn EU rival to the global positioning system (GPS) developed and controlled by the US. The system, which will have both civil and military uses, was commissioned in 2003 and is due for completion by 2020.The UK is claiming, according to a leaked government paper tabled this week in the negotiations in Brussels, that blocking British companies from the project will add €1bn (£880m) in costs and threaten security on both sides of the channel. It further claims that stopping British involvement during the transition period is a breach of the joint report agreed in December between the commission and the UK.The UK is now threatening to demand the return of more than €1bn of its contributions to EU space research unless Brussels backtracks.“An end to close UK participation will be to the detriment of Europe’s prosperity and security and could result in delays and additional costs to the programme”, the leaked UK technical note says. “Should the UK’s future access be restricted, the UK’s past contribution to the financing of space assets should be discussed.”The commission’s decision itself is said to be an issue for some member states, but the manner in which the UK has been treated has generally raised eyebrows.When the UK’s ambassador to the EU, Tim Barrow, was said to have sent a letter expressing his concerns over the block on UK firms, he was not given the courtesy of a response. He later received an apology as the letter had been lost by the European commission.The commission’s claim that the UK, as a “third country” after it leaves the EU, cannot be trusted with sensitive material related to the project has infuriated the government. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, raised concerns over the issue last week with his French counterpart.It has been reported that French officials have now raised their concerns with the commission over the decision to block UK involvement with the encrypted navigation system after Brexit.The French government, while generally hostile to the UK’s demands for preferential treatment once it leaves the bloc, is anxious to keep the UK in a tight relationship in relation to security. According to the Times, the concerns in Paris are shared by Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands and the Baltic states. Earlier this month the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is giving a speech in Brussels on Thursday, was said to want to sabotage the EU’s satellite navigation project by attempting to disrupt the transfer of sensitive encryption technology from Britain. It has also been suggested that the UK could launch its own £5bn rival system unless the EU backtracks.Meanwhile, UK negotiators in Brussels have further warned of significant economic and security dangers for Europe if the EU does not grant a special deal on data-sharing laws after Brexit. In an appeal for immediate talks on the issue, a government presentation given to Michel Barnier’s EU team on Tuesday demanded a seat on the body that applies data laws on companies, and has insisted that it should be given preferential treatment over other non-EU countries after Brexit.EU businesses in sectors ranging from finance to telecommunications that are reliant on current data-sharing arrangements earned €36bn from the UK in 2016, British officials said.In the same year, 13,000 requests from EU member states for information about criminal convictions of UK nationals received a response. Britain issued 35,000 notifications regarding EU nationals being convicted in the UK.The UK’s presentation said: “The continued, uninterrupted and secure flow of personal data between the EU and UK is vital for all partners.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83804273ef4347c787e0b79645ced902a629ff50/0_62_3977_2386/master/3977.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8471f15ec0284c2f2a8c55d52572fc4","title":"england dom bess jos buttler pakistan first test","story":"Performances of spinning newcomer and white-ball specialist will be closely watched in first Test against Pakistan when Alastair Cook and Ben Stokes will also be under spotlightWith uncertainty comes excitement and there are more uncertainties than usual as England begin their Test summer. So for those of a nervous disposition let me offer one cast-iron reassurance: in the field at Lord’s England will be a more vibrant, athletic outfit than they were last winter.The newcomer and the prodigal are brilliant fielders. Dom Bess, guaranteed to play according to Joe Root on the eve of the match, is a terrific presence in the field in the ring. So too is Jos Buttler, assuming he remembers how to do it. Before he was given the gloves Buttler was also a superb outfielder, fast and with safe hands, though if his return to Test cricket becomes permanent his slip-fielding prowess may have to be explored – this is not an area in which England have excelled recently beyond second slip.Now to the unknowns: the most eye-catching selection was the return of Buttler as a specialist No 7 batsman. He has excelled in the Indian Premier League, which served as a reminder of the “unique gifts” Ed Smith referred to when announcing the squad. England have had specialist batsmen at seven before – Derek Randall, Mike Gatting, Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash have batted there – but it is hard to recall the side ever adopting the notion of a “specialist seven” with particular freedom to play in an aggressive manner, honed by white-ball cricket. This is unpredictable and appetising – though it is doubtful the Lord’s faithful will break into a slow handclap if Buttler has not played his “ramp shot” within 10 minutes of his arrival at the crease.The oddity about Bess’s selection is that he could be construed as the conservative choice once the sad news of Jack Leach’s broken thumb had surfaced. Bess toured with the Lions in the winter he has played 16 first-class games with the astonishing return of 63 wickets at 22 apiece and he can bat a bit as well as field. His most obvious rival is Surrey’s Amar Virdi, a year younger than Bess at 19 with only seven first-class appearances for Surrey and 23 wickets at 26 apiece.Even so Bess’s elevation is incredibly rapid he will be England’s youngest finger spinner and in first-class cricket he has seldom bowled on a pitch that does not turn, which is likely to be the case at Lord’s for at least three days. Once again here is a (glorious) uncertainty.It does not end there. It may be that Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes will be the support bowlers for Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. Like Buttler they have just flown from the IPL into a Lord’s Test without playing any red-ball cricket this season. This may well work, but it breaks with convention and it is not so hard to predict how one or two old players might riff on the impossibility of playing proper Test cricket with such scanty preparation if Stokes and Woakes bowl poorly or run out of puff in the final session.Woakes is not guaranteed to play. He is competing with Mark Wood for the last bowling slot and Root explained England would inspect the pitch early on Thursday morning before making their decision. It was tricky to inspect it on Wednesday since it was locked under a white tarpaulin and then, after a quick mow, the hover cover.Currently those covers are hiding a healthy amount of green grass but the fact that the pitch was hidden from the sun all day suggests the groundstaff are concerned that it may become too dry too quickly.The selection conundrum probably goes like this: if England think the ball is going to jag around then they are more likely to go for Woakes if the pitch looks flat and batsman-friendly they may prefer Wood, who played in England’s last Test in Christchurch. Wood has the dubious reputation of being a better pick when his variety – the potential extra pace, his willingness to bowl bouncers – is deemed to be of greater value. A less cheerful man than Wood might then point out “I only play on the flat ’uns”.There remains more uncertainty about the opening batsmen even though Alastair Cook will be equalling the record set by Allan Border when playing his 153rd consecutive Test. The only game Cook, who has never been dropped, has missed was through illness in Mumbai in 2006, which would have been his third Test.Both sides have slumped since the drawn 2016 series here. They were vying for first place in the rankings then now Pakistan are seventh, England fifth. Sarfraz Ahmed, a sparky captain behind the stumps, is leading a team that is rebuilding and missing one of their best bowlers, the leg-spinner Yasir Shah, because of injury.“That is why we have inducted Shadab Khan and Faheem Ashraf so we can have five bowlers”, said Sarfraz. “If we had Yasir we would have played six batsmen and a keeper with four bowlers”.Shadab, who is only 19, bowls leg-breaks, Faheem medium pace and both can be classed as all-rounders. Along with Imam-ul Haq, Inzamam’s nephew, they represent the new generation. But as with so many players in this match we have no real idea how effective they will be over the next five days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cf8ddcaabe5e7e2a2121754c6af4b4b6fcdc3d3/206_338_1891_1135/master/1891.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96a1f2e77e77ccd314a4e5e32c911ccc","title":"ian poulter pga championship wentworth rubbish","story":"• Poulter wants to atone for ‘15 years of rubbish’ at Wentworth• Rory McIlroy aiming to be more competitive in his off-weeksIan Poulter has vowed to atone for “15 years of rubbish” as he returns to England for the PGA Championship.

FOM said they could not be construed as ‘grid girls’ and that they would not be holding board numbers nor standing in front of cars. The issue remains isive among drivers, with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel saying he believed dispensing with ‘grid girls’ had been unnecessary.F1 decided to cease the practice this season, replacing them with ‘grid kids’– young karters selected by each race’s host nation. The commercial director, Sean Bratches, was unequivocal about the decision at the time, saying ‘grid girls’ were “at odds with modern-day societal norms. We don’t believe the practice is appropriate or relevant to Formula One.”Monaco has been seen as a direct challenge to the change in policy. However, a senior source at F1 management told the : “What is going to happen here is nothing new.” The women would be present as part of a long-standing commercial relationship between the race and watch manufacturer Tag Heuer and would only be taking pictures and showing messages from social media.The ‘grid kids’ will still be present and FOM insisted there had been no change in policy. Of the five races held this season four have had a promotional presence on the grid. In Melbourne it was children selected by the organisers to promote Australia in Bahrain, Gulf Air hostesses and stewards in China, men and women representing Heineken and in Spain, air hostesses from Emirates Airlines.FOM said it has been in discussions with promoters on the decision and with Monaco for at least eight weeks in what was described as a collaborative process. It was suggested similar promotional activity might occur at other meetings this season but F1 had no intention of returning to using ‘grid girls’.Vettel, who trails Lewis Hamilton by 17 points in the world championship, said he believed the original decision had been an overreaction. “I think all the women that took part as a grid girl in the past did it because they want to,” he said. “I’m sure if you ask any grid girl on Sunday if they’re happy to stand there, their answer would be: ‘yes’. I don’t think there’s anybody that forces them to do it. It speaks a little bit of our times that sometimes there’s a lot of noise for nothing.”Hamilton was non-committal. “I definitely don’t think that we should ever be supporting or pushing these women in general to feel uncomfortable and, if they are, then we shouldn’t do it. If they’re comfortable doing it, I don’t really know,” he said.Haas’s Romain Grosjean disagreed with Vettel and thought F1 was right to dispense with what is seen by many as an archaic tradition. “When it was removed I thought it was a good thing for women in the 21st century because they were not used as just a board holder,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5c9edd10142de8da8cdff3b3e18bc2fa290140/136_520_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e62089d8d78c158d10dae4b1a22f3e4","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

It’s a timely decision for a work that charts a clash of generations between Enid, who has moved from Jamaica to make a life in England and give her children the opportunities she never had, and her teenage daughters – born in the UK – who know nothing of the West Indies and see England as home.There is a line about an immigrant who is told his papers are not in order and who faces deportation. “That was written 30 years ago,” says Pinnock, wryly. Her frustration with the slow pace of change in general, and theatre in particular, is quietly but potently expressed.“We need to honour these journeys that are so old. Hundreds of years old. We must honour the sacrifices made by my parents, but also by our great, great, great, great grandparents. There is a link with this country that goes back generations,” she says, referring to slavery. “We deserve opportunities and access because our history and sense of being is part of this country’s history. It’s important not to forget that, because our history is one of being overlooked and silenced. It’s a continuing cycle and unless it’s broken there can be no progress. You can’t get away from the fact that we have been oppressed.”This production will mark the first time Leave Taking has been staged in London since 1997, and Pinnock’s only regret is that her mother is no longer around to see it. She died three years ago, and her last words to the daughter who had asked her mum endless questions about life in Jamaica when creating the play was to urge her to keep writing. “She had Alzheimer’s, but her saying I must keep going, keep writing, made me realise how important it was to her.”It’s important to Pinnock, too. She may once have been described by this paper as “the godmother of black British playwrights”, but despite accolades – including the George Devine award, and numerous well-received plays including Talking in Tongues and Mules at the Royal Court in the mid-1990s – she has been sorely neglected. In recent years, she has written shorts for the Bush and the Tricycle and had several radio plays broadcast, but her last major play in the theatre was One Under, more than a decade ago. “I felt forgotten. It’s painful. Writers are so powerless. We have a directors’ theatre, and if you are going to get plays seen, you have to have people in buildings championing you – and I didn’t have that.”Now she does, in Madani Younis, who is directing Leave Taking and has commissioned her to write a new play. She has also just finished a draft of Rockets in Blue Light, which she describes as “a conversation between the past and the present” set in contemporary London and the 19th-century capital just after the abolition of slavery. She remains fascinated by the craft of writing, which has led to a fruitful life in academia teaching playwrighting (“I learn as much as I teach,”), but while she knows she has achieved a great deal and that every hard-won gain should be celebrated, she is also acutely aware of how far there is to go for writers of colour.“I never imagined I’d ever have a play on. I grew up in Islington, in the poor bit, in a single-parent household and I was educated in the inner city. When I was told I was the first black woman to have a play on at the National Theatre, I thought, ‘That’s great, that’s progress.’ But then I thought, ‘Why did it take so long?’” We meet in the week in which Natasha Gordon’s debut play, Nine Night, opened at the National to rave reviews, but Gordon is still one of only a handful of black female writers, including debbie tucker green and Michaela Coel, who have had their work staged at the National. It’s hard for any young playwright to progress, but without a strong champion for writers of colour – Pinnock’s early work was supported by Jules Wright and the Women’s Playhouse Trust – the invisible barriers further lessen the opportunities. “You are always finding yourself cast as a beginner, always a young writer, even though I no longer was,” she says. “There was a sense for me and my peers, other black women writers, of feeling we weren’t allowed to grow up and progress – the feeling that I constantly had to prove myself over and over, and never getting to the point when people said, ‘You can do this.’” Pinnock argues it is not just the inidual who suffers, but the entire culture, leaving each new generation of black female writers to feel that nothing came before them. “Always feeling that you are the first is a lonely place to be,” she says.“If writers like me are denied a full career and the opportunity to reach our mature voice and fulfil our creative potential or tell our stories, it’s not just a censoring of that inidual but the censoring of an entire community. I feel this far more passionately than I ever did. You leave a trace of yourself as an unresolved history. It’s not enough that you now have black actors playing parts not necessarily written for them. There is a culture and history that should be told and seen on stage. I used to think we needed change to progress. Now I think we need a revolution. I was a shy kid, full of self-doubt when I wrote Leave Taking. I’m no longer that shy kid. I’ve got stuff to say. Let me say it.” She smiles. “What can be so dangerous about that?”• Leave Taking is at the Bush theatre, London, from 24 May.

So here we are, fiddling while Brussels burns – for the UK, at least. Director Christian Trumble spins comedy and tragedy into a watchable, if at times teeth-grindingly frustrating three-part series that pulls off a remarkably balanced portrait of seven MEPs from across the political spectrum, all working to very different ends.This first episode sets out its W1A-ish tone – we hear that SNP MEP Alyn Smith has booked “the third-floor coffee lounge” for a charity mixer, and he grumbles that Ukip aren’t mingling and are only there for the free wine – primarily by concentrating on the most embattled of the bunch. Seb Dance, a young Labour MEP, is notorious for holding up a sign reading: “He’s lying to you” behind Nigel Farage as he spoke in the EU parliament. As a result, he says, he gets tweets calling him a “knob”, a “big girl’s blouse” and a “shitbag”, and strangers offering to take him outside. He’s earnest and so upset by Brexit that, at one point, it moves him to tears. Dance has spent six months working on getting a sustainability report passed. We follow him to the crucial vote.One person whose support he won’t get is Ukip’s Gerard Batten, who rejects the EU system entirely, and thinks that legislating to reduce the damage done to the environment by red meat consumption, for example, is Europe sticking its nose in. He doesn’t eat red meat himself, he adds. Doesn’t like it. Prefers chicken and fish. Imagine Farage with every last drop of charisma drained from him, cross that with Alan Partridge in his Linton Travel Tavern years, and you’ve got Batten, whose inadvertent comedy becomes less and less funny as the programme goes on. He speaks at a joint committee hearing for almost twice his allotted speech time when his microphone is eventually cut off, he declares that he is being discriminated against because he’s not a pro-EU leftie. This supposed denial of his democratic rights – his claims are quite clearly shown on camera to be untrue – is theatre and spectacle, designed to cultivate an image of victimhood and to disrupt proceedings as much as possible. Whatever you think about Ukip, it has proven an effective tactic, although Batten seems oblivious to just how embarrassing it looks when viewers are able to watch it play out from concept to execution.But then, he seems an oblivious kind of person. His 120-page alternative Brexit strategy, Taking Control, runs into hiccup after hiccup, ironically making it difficult for him to take control of anything, particularly his own report. The computer doesn’t work. He can’t print it out to send to journalists because it’s 120 pages long, and he doesn’t have the budget. He doesn’t bother talking to such mainstream media “propaganda organs” as the , the Times or Independent anyway, although he doesn’t mind the ’s propaganda organ, because it agrees with him, so that’s “fair enough”. We see him humming Land of Hope and Glory as he puts out his mini union jacks (“I’m the flag captain”). Like the other Ukip MEPs, he’s fighting Brussels from the inside, but if this is the extent of it, he makes a sorry case for the resistance.Of course I would say that. I’m part of a propaganda organ one that Batten doesn’t like. And one of the skills of this documentary is that I suspect it’s a Yanny-or-Laurel affair. If you want to see Dance as a member of the leftie metropolitan elite – and his little “Let’s Dance” moment, the framed “He’s lying to you” sign in his office, make it easy – then you can. If you want to see Batten as a bumbling buffoon who blusters about common sense despite appearing to be entirely lacking in it, then that, too, is perfectly possible. Carry on Brussels does not so much challenge preconceptions, as allow itself to be moulded to fit the ones that already exist. But wasn’t that what got us into this mess in the first place?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97db1d55006fee1460f5ca893278ecf4e8339198/0_135_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb0d060dd9e2612d6af91d80f360579","title":"westworld annoys me but is it ok to give up on it","story":"It is not easy to quit a series you once loved, but in the age of peak TV, there is no time for hate-watching shows that no longer rock your boatWhen I’m on my deathbed, surrounded by people I love, I know the regrets that will flash through my mind. I’ll regret trying to grow my hair out as a teenager. I’ll regret spending so much time on dishwasher comparison websites. But most of all – and I guarantee that this will happen – I will regret sticking with Westworld.And I suspect this is the case around the world. I have yet to meet a person – a real flesh-and-blood person, who does not work in television or get paid to write Westworld recaps – who can summon even a hint of excitement about it. Westworld’s entire audience, I am certain, is made up of people who sit there idly checking their phones during episodes because they’re still on the fence about formally giving up.I think I can feel the start of something similar happening with The Handmaid’s Tale. What started off as something timely and necessary has given way to out-and-out torture porn. The first episode of the second series – which variously included muzzling, nooses, freezing, chaining, burning and graphic, closeup self-mutilation – was essentially one liquidised pig’s carcass away from becoming Saw III: The Series. The Handmaid’s Tale is now so relentlessly grim, so spectacularly, queasily bleak, that it overwhelms any point it might be trying to make. I would be much happier if I gave up on it now and never looked back. But guess what? I am still here, because it is a big important show, and that apparently overrides whether or not I like it.This is not to say that I am entirely hamstrung by apathy. There have been a couple of moments this year where I have victoriously given up on a programme. The first was Amazon’s The Crossing, billed as The New Lost, but which ended up being a honking great mess of too many ingredients hurled at the screen with a shrug. Yes, it might have taken five episodes for me to get there, but turning to my wife at the conclusion of another hour of nothingy bullshit and asking “Do you actually want to keep watching this?” felt like a moment of genuine triumph. Same goes for BBC One’s’s Hard Sun, which I bailed from two episodes in because I’m only human.There was a time when I would have persevered more aggressively with these programmes. I might have even made a sport of it, turning Westworld into a hate-watch endurance test, gleefully yelling at the TV whenever Jeffrey Wright murmurs another faux-intellectual phrase with all the pretend idiot profundity his stupid robot body can muster. But what is the point, when there are dozens of better shows I could be watching instead? Or a new show that I would otherwise never get around to watching? To hate-watch Westworld in 2018 would be even more self-indulgent than Westworld itself, if you can imagine such a thing. So here I am, trapped in purgatory. This is what I want to know: at what point do you summon the courage to give up on a show? Is there a tipping point, a moment of no return, where you can happily cash in your chips and move on from a series you no longer enjoy? If there is, for God’s sake tell me, because I would love nothing more than to stop watching Westworld and The Handmaid’s Tale. I won’t stop watching them, obviously, but I would love to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0573824a1e4de66481dfd5f9d18f931af9d3ec/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=863cfb3a6a204fd1b6951e279d4d6f59","title":"italys president invites populist coalition to form government","story":"Government formed by anti-establishment Five Star Movement and far-right League will be led by political novice Giuseppe ConteItaly’s president has given his blessing to the creation of a new populist government in Rome to be led by Giuseppe Conte, a political newcomer who will serve as Italy’s next prime minister.The ascension of a virtually unknown law professor to Palazzo Chigi, who will lead a government that has been cobbled together by two rival populist parties – the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League – represents an unprecedented development in one of Europe’s biggest economies. The decision by Sergio Mattarella, Italy’s president, to grant Conte a mandate to form a government, despite serious last-minute questions about the professor’s academic credentials, means he will now be given the power to choose ministers for a new government, which could be sworn in in coming days.“I am conscious of confirming Italy’s European and international position,” Conte said, in his first remarks to the nation on Wednesday evening. “I propose being the defence lawyer of the Italian people.” He made the short address in front of cameras in the presidential palace following a two-hour meeting with Mattarella.For weeks, it was uncertain whether the M5S’s Luigi Di Maio and the bombastic Matteo Salvini of the League, who is expected to take the role of interior minister, would be able to form a government. But the agreement of a shared agenda late last week, which included slashing taxes, increasing spending, and tougher laws on migration, followed by the decision to nominate Conte, has put the coalition on track to lead Italy, albeit with a slim parliamentary majority.Mattarella, the head of state, reportedly had doubts about Conte’s nomination but on Wednesday evening gave his blessing to the choice after both Di Maio and Salvini indicated that the professor, who has served as a lawyer for Di Maio, was the only candidate they could agree on. Mattarella has also voiced concern about the pair’s choice for finance minister, Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old Eurosceptic economist who has said that Italy’s entry into the eurozone was a mistake.The question dominating Italy now is how Conte, an enigmatic figure who is a member of the M5S but has never been seen as a political force within the anti-establishment party, will govern and what the rise of two non-traditional populist parties, who won the most votes in Italy’s 4 March election, will mean for the eurozone’s third largest economy. Markets have dropped sharply in recent days on concerns about whether the new government is on a collision course with Brussels over its spending plans, with Italy’s 10-year bond yield, a measure of the market’s concern, hitting a 14-month high.“The big issue is, how do you govern a country like Italy, an industrial giant, with a populist government, in a large democracy within the constraints of the eurozone?” said Sergio Fabbrini, director of the LUISS School of Government in Rome.“This is a laboratory in a way. Nobody knows what will happen, because this is a government without precedent, and the two parties of this government are virtually incompatible,” he added.The March election split Italy in two. The wealthy north sided with the League, a formerly secessionist party that campaigned on a xenophobic platform and has called for mass deportations of undocumented migrants. Poor regions in southern Italy voted for the M5S, which has called for a basic minimum income and is a proponent of so-called “direct democracy”, in which big decisions are put to online votes for members to decide.Experts say voters in both parties are united by anger towards Brussels and the view that economic constraints have held Italy back. Both parties also support building closer ties to Russia and have accused the EU of abandoning Italy in the face of the migrant crisis.Among the many unknowns were the leadership style of the new prime minister and whether the M5S-Lega coalition would be able to govern cohesively, he said. Italy was – not unlike the UK’s Brexit vote – possibly on the precipice of a sweeping change that would steer the country toward a far more antagonistic relationship with the EU, Orsina said. But the new government’s slim majority, and fiscal limits, made it more likely that sweeping change would be constrained, he added.“My expectation is that this thing cannot go on for a very long period of time. And of course there are very strong limits of what they can do because they have a lot of objective limits. So my expectation is that in a few months time someone will say, we pull out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba6300a048ed2765e4250060d712c8641f8b0c0/0_0_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c4976c4ee2a4a2a74d0eec78f8e1ef6","title":"parents of lawyer nominated as italys pm worry about political mudslinging","story":"Giuseppe Conte respected by friends and colleagues but his parents are a little worried The man nominated as Italy’s prime minister may be respected in the legal and academic realms but he is far-removed from the complex, messy world of Italian politics - something that is of mounting concern to his parents.“They are a little worried,” Vittoria Macchiarola, a childhood friend of his mother, told the . “He is already very important in his career, but look what happens when you get into politics: they throw mud.”There was a lot of mud thrown this week when Giuseppe Conte, 53, emerged as the surprise pick to lead a coalition of Luigi Di Maio’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League, headed up by Matteo Salvini.The lawyer and professor at the University of Florence was accused of embellishing his university studies on his CV, while reports emerged that he had supported Stamina, a discredited stem cell therapy invented by the disgraced former professor Davide Vannoni. Beppe Grillo, the comedian who founded M5S, slammed the claims as “malicious gossip”. Conte’s ex-wife, with whom he has a 10-year-old son, also leapt to his defence, saying accusations over his CV and Stamina were “rubbish”.Patrizia Giunti, a friend and colleague at the University of Florence, described Conte as “attentive, generous and very graceful”. “He’s much loved by his students,” Giunti told the .“We have been friends and colleagues for years and I have never heard him speak with a raised voice or get angry – he’s always soft, someone you mostly see with his mouth shut rather than open, but at the same time he is very effective.”Conte graduated from Rome’s Sapienza University in 1988 and now lives in the capital, where he runs a law firm. He is an expert in arbitration, particularly in the areas of civil and commercial law. Between 2012 and 2015 he served on the board of the Italian Space Agency.Conte came into contact with M5S in 2013, the year the party entered parliament for the first time, when he was asked to become a member of its council for administrative law. Di Maio, 31, had also earmarked him for the role of minister of public administration when he announced the party’s would-be cabinet lineup ahead of the elections. Conte told reporters in February that until 2013 he had been a left-wing voter.He is thought to be the mastermind behind Di Maio’s pledge to abolish 400 “useless laws” in order to cut Italy’s infamous red tape and free up the economy.A passionate fan of AS Roma, Conte is said to also be deeply spiritual and devoted to Saint Padre Pio.Italian media reported that he is also a fan of John F Kennedy, with his WhatsApp profile containing a quote from the assassinated US president: “Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoWhere we have a Yes vote, I imagine women would access services across the Border\u0026rsquoBallot paper will ask voters if they wish to approve Bill seeking to repeal Article 40.3.3Government-funded scheme receives 15 letters from solicitors in the past two weeksHarris confident Oireachtas will support the law because \u0026lsquonobody has any alternative\u0026rsquoCeann Comhairle suspends D\u0026aacuteil debate on Bill over contradictory amendmentsIRFU head attends reception to mark Six Nations, Triple Crown and Grand Slam successResearch Lives: Javier Varela, Research Assistant with the Chassy project at University College CorkCity as old as Waterford but Norsemen landed on Suirside earlier, says archeologistSpirit of sacrifice and courage which produced the Belfast Agreement must be rediscoveredInternational media arrive in Dublin as photocalls and press conferences wind downBody of sixty-year-old local man was discovered close to Crow Island in Kilkieran BayAcrimony and personal antipathy that has bubbled under the surface emerged in flashesMost vulnerable, including poor reliant on food banks at risk \u0026ndash British Medical JournalAdelaide Doran says doctors gave her no choice but to go ahead with the deliveryWarm weather to continue as country heads to the polls for Eighth Amendment voteThey got onto the road and his friend says \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom a bit drunk, will you drive?\u0026rsquo, court toldGarda\u0026iacute issue photo of Jastine Valdez bag as search for her belongings continues"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505620.1527084793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"single people discriminated against on social housing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin called for an online system of allocating most local authority housing. Photograph: Eric LukeThe Single people are being discriminated against in the provision of social housing, according to a national housing charity. John-Mark McCafferty, chief executive of Threshold, said the supply of local authority housing does not reflect the type of people on waiting lists.  The accommodation local authorities build and acquire is mostly three and four-bedroom houses, when single person households make up a “huge proportion” of those on waiting lists, he pointed out.“The available housing not only fails to meet need in general supply, but also does not reflect the population characteristics of the waiting list and the ersity of household types, with an aging population and increasing numbers of smaller households.” Mr McCafferty said there needs to be “a better balance” in construction and acquisition of properties to reflect the nature of waiting lists. He was addressing the Oireachtas housing committee on Wednesday, along with representatives from the County and City Management Association (CCMA) and Department of Housing officials. The committee was examining local authority housing waiting lists. Threshold said its clients regularly report “very long waiting times” for housing but this varies from place to place Andrew Guy, from Threshold, said in Galway some people have been on the list for 14 years. The charity has called for a national policy on the allocation of local authority housing. It said one possibility was a “score sheet” to include points for time on the waiting list and special considerations such as medical needs. Kathleen Holohan, a member of the County and City Management Association said the average time on housing waiting lists varies from local authority to local authority, ranging from less than six months to more than seven years. “Just because somebody is 10 years on the list doesn’t necessarily mean that they didn’t get offers of accommodation. In some cases people have declined many offers of accommodation,” Ms Holohan added. In its opening submission to the committee, the CCMA said the definition of homelessness needs to be clarified or reviewed and those availing of emergency accommodation should be visited regularly and receive active supports to source alternative accommodation. Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin said the primary mechanism for allocating most properties should be Choice Based Letting (CBL). Choice Based Letting allows local authorities to advertise some of their social housing online so approved applicants can express an interest in the available properties. The Dublin Mid-West TD said it is a much more efficient system and gives applicants “some level of control” over the properties that they’re expressing an interest for. He said there are some issues that need to be addressed however, such as applicants who don’t have access to computers or are not computer literate. Mary Hurley, assistant secretary at the Department of Housing, said the scheme is operational in 16 areas across the country and by the end of the year many more local authorities will have it in place. Ms Hurley also said the department has been working with local authorities on “greater flexibility” for cases of domestic violence or similar “specific cases”.

On the pavement outside Leinster House, a man walks up and down with a sign hanging from his neck.“Yes Voters” it reads. “You should have been aborted.”A woman pushing a baby-buggy shoots him a filthy glance as she passes. “You’re disgusting,” she snaps, hurriedly escaping his noxious presence.International news crews are arriving in the city to cover the referendum, most of them coming from the UK and last weekend’s royal wedding. There is talk that Kay Burley from Sky News has landed.The photocall and press conference production line is slowing down. The Yes campaigners are upbeat. The No campaigners are not.Their respective political supporters reflect the mood. The party leaders are calm and reasoned and cautiously optimistic.While Mattie McGrath complains ever more loudly and angrily about alleged electoral fraud – “Majella from Mayo” got voting cards as did a French lad in Galway. And the disgraceful media bias against the No side has been, well, disgraceful. It’s all one big “stitch-up”.Meanwhile, back to Leinster House, where the party leaders are making their final remarks in the chamber before Friday’s vote. They speak with one voice, and that voice says an emphatic “Yes”.The Taoiseach thanks all of them for their work during the campaign and pays particular tribute to socialist TDs Ruth Coppinger and Claire Daly for their early work in putting the abortion issue on the political agenda in Leinster House, “perhaps at a time when many of us would have preferred not to deal with it”.The atmosphere in the chamber is close to one of relief. There is a definite feeling across all the parties now that the Yeses have it.But not everyone is happy. Sinking retain spirits are confirmed afterwards in the corridors by doleful men solemnly predicting that the No vote in their rural constituencies will not nearly be high enough to swing the result their way.As the leader of Fianna Fáil reaffirms his support for repealing the Eighth Amendment and the proposed legislation to follow, four male colleagues sit in the row in front of him looking extremely glum. Micheál McGrath, the finance spokesman tipped as a leadership contender, shakes his head now and then, and sighs heavily, his pinched expression trapped somewhere between distraught and disgusted.Next to him, James Browne from Wexford, another staunch No campaigner, looks similarly stricken. And beside him, Meath’s Thomas Byrne and then Cavan’s Brendan Smith, two more committed anti-abortion TDs. They bury their noses in their mobile devices while their leader and opposing leaders talk of a better future.“I want the people who are worried about this decision . . . and who will vote ‘no’ in clear conscience, to know that if there is a Yes vote this weekend, Ireland will still be the same country it was before the vote. It will just be a little bit more compassionate,” says Leo Varadkar.The four lads don’t look remotely convinced.When talk finally moves from the referendum, McGrath and Browne jump up together and rush from the chamber. Micheál Martin, the one most likely to be on the right side of history come Saturday, watches them go.Earlier, Martin made sure to put on the record that the legislation before the Dáil in the event of a Yes vote “in no way presents abortion on demand nor is it comparable to the legislative regime in the UK. That needs to be said.”He explained the lengthy process whereby that legislation came about. First, the Citizen’s Assembly.“A stitch-up!” declared Mattie McGrath, who was very agitated.And then the Oireachtas cross-party committee.Not happy. But then, outside Leinster House earlier in the morning, there came strange rumblings from the No camp, whose disparate groups appeared to be fracturing under the pressure of possible defeat. Cora Sherlock, deputy chairperson of the Pro-Life Campaign (has anyone ever heard from the chairman during this campaign. Is there one? Where is heshe hiding?), hadn’t appeared at the previous night’s big TV debate, as expected.As anti-abortion campaigners immediately blamed the liberal media’s interference for the no-show of one of their star speakers, Sherlock issued a strange little video, shot in a Spartan, bunker-like room, claiming she hadn’t withdrawn from the debate but had wanted to participate.She was only short of holding up to the camera a newspaper with the day’s date on it to prove she is still in the campaign.Meanwhile, as the news reporters and camera crews fanned across Dublin in search of teenage firebrands and fulminating clerics, the Sinn Féin leader was speaking about abortion pills and one mother’s story of having to watch her teenage daughter bleed at home for three days having secretly taken them.“Are we prepared to look the other way?” asked Mary Lou, as this country has done for decades as Irish women have clandestine abortions. “I’m not. I’m not prepared to look the other way.”Leo Varadkar said that retaining the Eighth Amendment ties the hands of medics who want to look after women properly.“Doctors can intervene to end a pregnancy only if there is a risk to the life of the mother, not a risk to health. To me, a risk to life is a very low bar . . . we can change from a risk to life to a serious risk to the health of the mother,” he said.Ruth Coppinger classed the referendum as “one of the most important votes in decades in this country”. She attacked the No campaign for the “thinly veiled misogyny” of its messages before starting a list of all the social issues its leading lights over the years had opposed.“As well as saying ‘no’ to the right of a woman to have a choice, the leaders of the No campaign have said no to contraception. They said no to sex education. They said no to same-sex marriage three years ago. They have said no to orce, to equal employment, to married women being in the public service, to working mothers, to LGBT+ rights and to gender recognition . . .”The most bizarre intervention came from Fianna Fáil’s Éamon Ó Cuív, who said the other day that we were all unborn once. (Although it might have been a different story for him if his grandfather Dev hadn’t had that US passport after the 1916 Rising when his comrades were being executed by the British.)He told the Taoiseach the prison sentence of up to 14 years on the books for women who have abortions could be reduced by treating abortion as infanticide under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act of 2006. Infanticide, said Young Dev, is now treated as manslaughter “which can carry a very, very short prison sentence”.He also asked the Taoiseach to apologise for saying in the Dáil that he was in favour of decriminalising the abortion pill. Which the Taoiseach duly did.Leo told Éamon he thought he heard him say this, but was happy to stand corrected and acknowledge this isn’t his view.“I didn’t say what my view was, Taoiseach. That’s not what the issue is. The issue was that you said I said something I didn’t say. But my view is a different issue.”That’s cleared that up so.On the subject of infanticide, Leo explained that the amendment holds that the right to life of the unborn, even at one week’s gestation, is equal to the right to life of a pregnant woman. “So the penalty for having an abortion has to be equal to the penalty for killing a pregnant woman, which is not infanticide because, obviously, infants do not get pregnant. The penalty has to be at the level of homicide or manslaughter.”Was Ó Cuív seriously taking the Dáil down this rabbit hole and women taking pills or travelling abroad daily to terminate crisis pregnancies?And how strange is it that a woman gets a lesser sentence for killing a baby or toddler, with her mental health taken into account, but a women terminating a five-week old foetus gets a longer sentence?It would be truly daft, if it wasn’t so awfully serious.Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505854.1527092826!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"obscure provision may permit open border if no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBorder at Newry: Prof Federico Fabbrini says the EU could “declare the entire territory of Northern Ireland to be a frontier zone to the EU customs union thereby removing the need for customs controls (at least on the EU side)”. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyThe EU could use an obscure provision in an international trade treaty to preserve a frictionless border in Ireland in the aftermath of a no-deal, no-transition Brexit, a new report commissioned by MEPs suggests.The report to the European Parliament Constitutional Affairs Committee on the legal institutional implications of a hard Brexit – a prospect which is unlikely in the current state of negotiations, he suggests – has been prepared by Dublin City University’s energetic Prof Federico Fabbrini, director of its Brexit Institute, and will be presented at a meeting of the committee on Thursday. \u0026nbsp It warns that in the event of a hard, no-deal Brexit in which there was no transition arrangement or withdrawal agreement, from April 1st, 2019, “contingency plans would need to be put in place from the EU side to deal with the sudden emergence of a customs border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”. \u0026nbsp That could be done, he argues, by invoking Article XXIV(3) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) , which provides for a so-called “frontier traffic exception”. It is one way of doing what four parties in the North have urged in recent days – keeping the North inside the customs union and single market. \u0026nbsp The clause, which has never been used before, allows that custom provisions under the World Trade Organisation regime which would prevail in both the EU and UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit “shall not be construed to prevent: a) advantages accorded by any contracting party to adjacent countries in order to facilitate frontier traffic . . .”This would allow the EU, Fabbrini says, to “declare the entire territory of Northern Ireland to be a frontier zone to the EU customs union thereby removing the need for customs controls (at least on the EU side)”.Whether the 27 remainer states would be willing to allow such a gaping hole in the EU’s external frontier is not clear – they have been most firm to date in their insistence on preserving the “integrity of the single market” and it would immediately raise questions about how to deal with east-west trade across the Irish Sea.Such a policy might also not completely obviate the necessity for border controls to ensure regulatory compliance in areas like veterinaryanimal health standards.Fabbrini’s paper also argues that a hard Brexit would not mean that the UK would not remain obligated in international law to fulfil its commitments to the current EU budget, which runs until the end of 2020. \u0026nbspPrior to the joint report signed in December, some UK politicians insisted that the UK’s obligations to the budget would cease on Brexit. But the UK government conceded in the joint report that it would honour whatever undertakings it had made in the current budget round. \u0026nbsp Although the Brexit talks are based on the principle of “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”, Fabbrini insists that under the legal principle of “fair play”, “the fact that the UK has already accepted its budgetary responsibilities as a condition of withdrawal implies that the EU will have a strong legal case against the UK for budgetary contributions even in a hard-Brexit scenario”.Although he admits that finding a court with jurisdiction to uphold such an EU case would be difficult, he argues that the UK is unlikely to be willing to test the argument legally.The report also considers the effect of Brexit – whether hard or soft – on the ending of the terms of members of various institutions. Fabbrini argues that UK MEPs should continue to serve after Brexit on March 29th for a further six weeks until the European Parliament concludes its own term and has elections.The UK European commissioner, Julian King, should quit on the 29th, he says. But the UK members of the European Court of Justice should be allowed to finish out their own six-year terms – technically speaking, they do not “represent” inidual states. Leaving them in place, he says, would be “more consistent with the preservation of the constitutional integrity of the ECJ as an institution which has not been tainted by national interests”.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.North Korea threatens to scrap Trump summit after Mike Pence\u0026#39s \u0026#39ignorant and stupid\u0026#39 remarksCynthia Nixon vows to continue campaign for New York governor despite failing to get Democrat endorsementWho stole the World Cup in 1966?

It seems to me that it\u0027s out of control.”In an email from a manager after Ms Fitzpatrick raised the alleged incident, it was claimed that it was a case of “boys just being boys”.Ms Fitzpatrick claimed that over a period of almost 10 years she had been subjected to behaviour including being mocked about having a miscarriage, being told certain staff didn\u0027t want a foreign woman”, and subjected to racist language.One of the men allegedly involved, who has left the agency, told the corporation: “These are false allegations. I can\u0027t remember the event you mention, but if it did happen, it would have been office banter. Just a craic. Certainly nothing to do with abuse.”Ms Fitzpatrick, of Janetstown, near Thurso, is understood to have been signed off from work since her father died in November 2016.She is understood to be facing a disciplinary hearing from her employers at the end of May, over charges of being overzealous in her job and rude to clients.A spokesman for the government said it had “clear standards of behaviour which apply to all staff”, adding: Any concerns raised by staff are taken seriously and investigated fully.” It also said that in addition to the ongoing tribunal there were internal procedures underway, and it would be wrong to pre-empt the outcome.Law and orderNorth Korea threatens to scrap Trump summit after Mike Pence\u0026#39s \u0026#39ignorant and stupid\u0026#39 remarksCynthia Nixon vows to continue campaign for New York governor despite failing to get Democrat endorsementWho stole the World Cup in 1966?

More than three in five (63 per cent) “outstanding” grammar schools have not been inspected for six or more years, compared to just over a third (36 per cent) of “outstanding” non-selective schools.The number of complaints made to Ofsted from parents about schools has more than doubled in the last decade, reaching approximately 11,000 a year, Mr Tryl added.Despite concerns about the figures, Ofsted officials said that inspectors will go into “outstanding schools” if there are safeguarding concerns, dramatic fall in results, or a serious complaint.The NAO report added that Ofsted has struggled to meet targets amid falling budgets and high staff turnover – and that the lack of reliable data means it cannot show it provides value for money.Almost two decades ago, a team of 16 inspectors used to go into every secondary school – regardless of their previous rating – for a whole week typically every six years, Ofsted officials said.Now “good” schools get two inspectors for one day approximately every four years, and up to four inspectors for a couple of days if it is in special measures, with reinspection within 30 months.The report found that Ofsted did not meet its target to reinspect schools graded as inadequate, where the quality of education provision is most at risk, in 78 cases.Ofsted also failed to meet its legal target of inspecting a school within five years of last inspection in 43 cases between 2012-13 and 2016-17, the NAO found.In 32 cases it had incorrectly treated expanded or amalgamated schools as new schools in the remaining 11 it deferred on the basis of exceptional circumstances.School inspectors provide only a “snapshot” of standards rather than the “comprehensive picture” they did around two decades ago, officials said, and they cited slashed budgets as one of the reasons behind this.Ofsted spent 52 per cent less in real terms in 2017-18 than it did in 1999-2000.Teachers criticise ‘Islamophobic’ Ofsted approach to hijabs in schoolsOfsted to be given new powers to crack down on illegal schools Over-stretched schools ‘shovelling’ children back to parentsUK news in picturesUK news in picturesHome Secretary Sajid Javid speaking at the annual conference of the Police Federation of England and Wales at the International Convention Centre in Birmingham.Felix, two,sits next to messages and flowers left in Manchester, ahead of the Manchester Arena National Service of Commemoration at Manchester Cathedral to mark one year since the Manchester attack.

We have repeatedly made clear that we want to ensure accountability is proportionate, helps to ensure standards in our schools are high and does not distract high-performing schools from what matters most – teaching and providing an excellent education.“If Ofsted has reason to believe a school is no longer meeting its previous high standards, we would expect it to use its powers to carry out a full inspection – this has always been the case – and remains so.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Screens will buzz with static and interference before going blank and entirely silent, leaving viewers staring into the void – or searching for their remote controls – for five long seconds, it wrote.But the reason people are being tricked should become clear soon enough, when the ad spot comes to an end and a message will display that reads: “This is your TV screen ... most of the time a void full of nothing.” The rest of the ad will explain the QLED TV\u0027s technology.The ads will begin on Friday evening, when they will still be relatively short. But they will eventually become even longer – eight seconds of a 30 second ad spot – and will cut right into the middle of the Champions League final when it airs on Saturday evening.Given that many people will be watching that match in pubs and other venues, it seems likely that the controversial ad campaign could wreak havoc in the middle of one of the most watched TV events of the year.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

The two stars are a mere 20 kilometres apart – but they are around 6,500 light years from Earth.One of the stars is a cool, lightweight star called a brown dwarf. The other is an energetic, strange and spinning star known as a pulsar.Scientists spot strange lasers coming towards Earth from \u0027space ant\u0027The gas coming out of the brown dwarf appears to be magnifying the energy from the pulsar, and sending out a bright streak of radiation.The gas is acting as like a magnifying glass right in front of the pulsar, says Robert Main, lead author of the paper describing the observation being published May 24 in the journal Nature. We are essentially looking at the pulsar through a naturally occurring magnifier which periodically allows us to see the two regions separately.The pulsar could eventually destroy the brown dwarf. They are locked together in a system sometimes called a black widow – just as those spiders eat their mates, the pulsars are thought to kill the stars they are attached to.The discovery could help explain fast radio bursts, the intense blasts of radiation that are occasionally sent down to Earth. Those powerful signals are until now entirely unexplained – and have prompted suggestions that they are the result of either undiscovered physics or even artificial technology.Many observed properties of FRBs could be explained if they are being amplified by plasma lenses, say Main. The properties of the amplified pulses we detected in our study show a remarkable similarity to the bursts from the repeating FRB, suggesting that the repeating FRB may be lensed by plasma in its host galaxy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When Labour is elected we will carry through that pledge.”Asked whether he was now going further than the manifesto, he added: “The commitment is clear. And by the way, anyone who is appointed to the House of Lords under existing rules from the Labour party is required to support that.”Mr Corbyn recently appointed former Labour general secretary Iain McNicol, campaigner Martha Osamor and writer Pauline Bryan to the Lords.The House of Lords defeats the government voting to remove the Brexit date from the billBut the strong words from his spokesman also come after more than 80 Labour peers ignored their leader’s will and backed a plan to keep the UK in the EU’s single market.They helped rebel Tory peers to inflict a defeat on the government over the issue during the passage of Ms May’s EU (Withdrawal) Bill – one of 15 her administration suffered in recent weeks.Ms May has also recently appointed nine new peers to the Lords. Questioned on how she justified the new commitments, her spokesman said that the overall size of the Lords had reduced during her tenure.And on appointing ex-ministers, like Peter Lilley and Sir Eric Pickles, he said: “The nominations reflect our determination that the House of Lords should contain people from various walks of life.“But also people who have expertise that can add to the overall contribution the house makes.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Secretary\u0026nbspDeVos\u0026nbspis once again wrong’Civil rights groups have heavily criticised US education secretary Betsy DeVos for saying that schools can decide whether to report undocumented students to immigration enforcement officials. They said her statements conflict with the law and could raise fears among immigrant students.Ms DeVos’s answers came during testimony before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. New York Democrat Adriano Espaillat, himself an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who was at one time undocumented, pressed the secretary for her positions on immigration enforcement.“Inside the school,” Mr Espaillat asked, “if a principal or a teacher finds out that a certain child is undocumented, or his or her family members are undocumented, do you feel that the principal or teacher is responsible to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to have that family reported?”M DeVos replied:“Sir, I think that’s a school decision. That’s a local community decision. And again, I refer to the fact that we have laws and we also are compassionate, and I urge this body to do its job and address or clarify where there is confusion around this.”Not so, say civil rights groups. The Supreme Court made clear in Plyler v. Doe that public schools have a constitutional obligation to provide schooling for children, regardless of immigration status. That means schools also cannot enforce measures that would deter undocumented children from registering. They cannot ask about immigration status and according to the American Civil Liberties Union, they cannot report students or their families to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.“Let’s be clear: Any school that reports a child to ICE would violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court has made clear that every child in America has a right to a basic education, regardless of immigration status,” Lorella Praeli, the ACLU’s director of immigration policy and campaigns, said in a statement. “Secretary DeVos is once again wrong.”The Supreme Court ruling has not prevented some states from attempting to bar undocumented children from their schools. California voters in 1994 passed Proposition 187, which required schools to kick out undocumented students and to report students they suspected of being undocumented to federal authorities, but the law was struck down in federal court.Alabama in 2011 passed a measure requiring school districts to ask all students about their immigration status and report their findings to the state. The federal government and others challenged the law, saying it violated Plyler because it preceded an uptick in absenteeism among Latino students. A federal appellate court blocked its implementation two years later.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople protest outisde the Tamil Nadu House after at least 10 people were killed when police fired on protesters seeking closure of plant on environmental grounds in town of Thoothukudi in southern state of Tamil Nadu, in New Delhi.People demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

Under the Plyler decision, “Any public school or school district that denies an education to any undocumented child – whether by refusing to enroll, by limiting access to the programs and benefits provided to other students, or by reporting a child to ICE – has violated the United States Constitution.”Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, declared the matter “settled constitutional law”.“Betsy DeVos should know better, and to suggest otherwise only serves to frighten children,” Ms Eskelsen García said.Asked to respond to the backlash, Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said: Ms DeVos has repeatedly said that DACA students have the right to a K-12 education, as ruled on by the Supreme Court”. Ms Hill used the acronym for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides two-year, renewable work permits and deportation protections for about 690,000 “dreamers,” undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children.“She has tremendous compassion for DACA students and has said repeatedly she hopes that Congress would do its job and give these students the certainty they deserve,” Ms Hill said.The exchange comes as the immigration debate reaches a fever pitch, with President Trump threatening to jail leaders of sanctuary cities and an increase in immigration enforcement. In some places, schools have also reassured community members that they will not permit immigration agents on school grounds, nor will they turn student records over to the immigration agency without a subpoena.Historically, immigration agents have avoided schools.

About 725,000 of those children were unauthorized immigrants.Mr Espaillat also grilled Ms DeVos about accounts of immigration agents arresting parents near schools. DeVos declined to say whether she supported the Trump administration’s enforcement actions.“We are a nation of laws and a nation of compassionate people,” Ms DeVos said. “I think it’s important that we follow the laws of the land, and if it’s important that laws be changed, this body can do so.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

out at least one massacre of Hindu villagers in Myanmar’s conflict-wracked Rakhine state, an Amnesty International report has concluded. Ethnic conflict has convulsed the southeast Asian country in recent years, with the military accused of slaughtering members of the Muslim Rohingya minority in the majority-Buddhist country.But the new report from the human rights organisation suggests that a Rohingya group known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) killed up to 99 Hindu women, men and children while also abducting Hindu villagers.‘Bittersweet’ Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced

saying they were suppressing an armed insurrection after attacks on police posts.The Rohingya have responded by suggesting that their communities suffered disproportionate and undiscerning government reprisals as a result.But while the Amnesty report accused Myanmar authorities of orchestrating a frenzy of “unlawful killings, rapes, and burning of villages” targeted at the Rohingya, driving a mass exodus to neighbouring Bangladesh, it said “no atrocities can justify the massacre, abductions, and other abuses” committed against Hindu villagers.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya Crisis in Photos

crucial as it is for the crimes against humanity carried out by Myanmar’s security forces in northern Rakhine State”, Ms Hassan said.After ARSA members launched an assault on army installations in August of 2017, the report says, Myanmar’s security forces responded with an “unlawful and grossly disproportionate campaign of violence marked by killings, rape and other sexual violence, torture, village burning, forced starvation tactics and other human rights violations”.Security forces targeted all Rohingya in Rakhine state, the report alleges.ARSA responded by unleashing violence on Hindu people, according to Amnesty. It says the group killed some Hindu villagers “execution-style” and abducted others, with survivors recounting having been forced to convert to Islam if they wished to be spared.The group denied having carried out a massacre.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve not sold it and that’s all I’m saying.”A man, believed to be her father, also answered the door but declined to comment.Claire apparently sold off the thoughtful gift after being one of the 1,200 non-VIP­ members of the public invited to share in Meghan and Harry’s big day outside St Georges Chapel on Saturday.The Daily Mail reported she had shared her excitement about the big day, reportedly tweeting: I got to watch the royal wedding right outside Windsor Castle in this amazing setting. Such an amazing day #Golden ticket #Royal connections.But the excitement apparently didnt last long as her complimentary goodie bag was posted on eBay hours later where it eventually went for £21,400.The hessian bags, inscribed with the couples initials, contained a welcome letter, commemorative chocolate coin, bottled Windsor Castle water, fridge magnet, official order of service and a tin of shortbread.Claire received more than 80 bids on her listing - with one bid of £60,000 retracted - before managing to sell it.The young woman is not believed to have received the cash yet.According to eBay rules, bids can only be retracted within one hour if there is less than 12 hours in the auction to go. The decision to allow a bid to be cancelled is up to the seller.But Claire isnt the only opportunist to sell off the commemorative bag, with a number of other bags put up for sale just hours after the wedding that saw everyone from the Queen to the Clooneys attend.One seller called Chrisofwilliams, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, stands to make more than £40,000 after putting his commemorative bag on eBay.The gift was initially listed for 99p on Sunday, with the seller saying: Buy a piece of history and memorabilia to celebrate a momentous special day for Britain’s and the royal family.I am selling my limited Goody bag for guests of Royal wedding of Meghan and Harry 19th May 2018.Official bag with full contents containing commemorative chocolate coin unopened sealed and in original condition, labelled spring water bottle unopened and sealed in original condition: royal wedding fridge magnet unopened in original packaging, the castle spectator badge and a tub of ‘handbag shortbread’ unopened as well as a Marriage order of service booklet and a 20% off voucher of middle ward shop in Windsor castle.Don’t miss out on this limited once in a life time opportunity to have a piece of royal history.”The hessian gift bag was given to the 2,640 guests who were invited to the wedding of the year.But many saw the monetary value in flogging off the bag, selling it online.So what does the bag actually contain? - Bottle of Windsor Castle Still Spring Water 500mL- Harry and Meghan Traditiaionl Handbag Shortbread Biscuits- Royal Wedding 2018 Belgian Milk Chocolate Coin 90g- Royal Wedding Commemorative Magnet- Voucher for royalcollectionshopAnother online listing has reached £420 while another hit £411.One of of the listings, the seller declared proudly: “At the wedding today I received this wonderful gift bag for guests.”And the post promised: “I forgot to mention all money raised will go to charity.”Another seller has even been trying to flog PDFs of the Royal Wedding order of service - for £5 each.As the non-VIP guests departed on Saturday the wedding reception turned into an ­outrageous party with a very royal dance-off and “beer pong” games. The Sun can reveal that chat-show superstar James Corden — who was compering the event — instigated an extraordinary dance routine which featured Prince Charles, Prince William and Harry.The royal couple chose I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the fun-filled, early-hours wedding bash.Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36 — now the Duke and ­Duchess of Sussex — let their hair down to the hit by Whitney Houston at Frogmore House, Windsor, where telly’s Corden hosted dinner and fireworks for 200 guests.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

It’s the uncertainty caused by Remain diehards in the Commons and Lords bent on scuppering it and even destroying our Government.It is destabilising for firms not to know what Brexit will look like. If Theresa May formed a position fully honouring the result, and told the EU to like it or lump it, the unease would end overnight.Our economy would take off like a rocket.IT is disgraceful that Google is revealing rape victims’ names via the “autocomplete” function on its searches.

Fine words are well known for not buttering parsnips, and we are not getting our parsnips buttered at the moment.”His withering attack continued: “In terms of these negotiations, particularly as they’re led by someone who backed Remain, trust is very important. And it’s very important that the Government maintains faith with those who voted leave.To go into the negotiations to say to Mr Barnier, We will kowtow before you in every way you possibly want if we cannot get everything ready by the due date, encourages him to say, Just kowtow, Im quite happy.No10 hit back to say Mrs May making “good progress” on leaving the EU in an attempt to play down the latest outbreak of government civil war over Brexit. Last night Mrs May was backed by Boris Johnson who said she was the “custodian” of Brexit.Speaking in Argentina, the Foreign Secretary said: “The Prime Minister is the custodian of the plan, which is to come out of the customs union, out of the single market and to get on with it, to get on with that project with all convenient speed -- and that is what we are going to do.He added: “What people like Argentina, Peru, Chile, outward, free-trading countries, what they want to hear from us is that we are getting on with it with confidence and brio and zap and dynamism.”In a further embarrassment for the Govt its own immigration minister admitted she had never read the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland.The Home Office minister with responsibility for the Irish border Caroline Nokes said she was “probably giving birth” when it was signed 20 years ago.The pro-EU Best for Britain campaign hit back: “It seems that ministers have no idea of history or even policy.“It is scandalous that ministers can deliver answers like this. It is a slap in the face to the people of Northern Ireland.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000180243126.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"flight mh370 photo mystery latest news conspiracy theories","story":"Christine Negroni said pics of washed up wreckage shows the Boeing 777s wing flaps were retracted when it smashed into the sea in March 2014.It means that the plane was not being fully controlled when it landed — casting further doubt on bombshell claims made by former Canadian air crash investigator Larry Vance.He told Australias 60 Minutes earlier this month that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah flew off course on a suicide mission and planned to kill himself and the 238 others on the journey from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur.Mr Vance said: He [the pilot] was killing himself unfortunately, he was killing everybody else on board, and he did it deliberately.And in his new book MH370: Mystery Solved, Mr Vance says evidence suggests Shah cruelly tried to ditch the plane as gently as possible to avoid creating wreckage that would make it easier to find.But Ms Negroni has blasted his conclusions as preposterous and absurd — and says photos prove her point.In a post on her website following the show, she fumed: Ladies and gents, thanks to 60 Minutes, pilots Vance and Hardy are in the cockpit.They’ve fuelled up with alternative facts and are taking us on a flight to the absurd.“Will we ever return from this remote region of reality? Stay tuned.”She accused the show of airing “far-fetched”, “hokum” details — in particular is claims about the wing flap suggesting a controlled landing.Vance had said the wings flaps, that washed ashore in 2016, were extended as they would be in a controlled landing.Mr Vance told Australian show 60 Minutes that the flaps were extended, just as they would be during a controlled landing.It lent weight to his theory that the pilot flew on a sinister murder-suicide mission, trying to ditch the plane gently in the water to prevent floating wreckage that could be visible to search teams.But his claim that the flaps were extended has been refuted — as photos show they were in fact in the retracted position.Flaps remain retracted during a flight and are deployed in controlled landings.If they are not extended, it suggests the pilot was not fully in control when the plane went down.MH370 search director Peter Foley said: “If it was being controlled at the end, it wasn’t very successfully being controlled. The flaps weren’t deployed.But Ms Negroni wrote Vance should have revisited that statement when a forensic examination showed the flaperon was very likely stowed, not deployed when the plane crashed.”She pointed to an October 2017 report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which said: It was established from the debris that the aircraft was not configured for a ditching at the end-of-flight.Analysis indicated that the flaps were most likely in a retracted position at the time they separated from the aircraft making a controlled ditching scenario very unlikely.Ms Negronis view has been backed by MH370 search director Peter Foley.He said: “If it was being controlled at the end, it wasn’t very successfully being controlled. The flaps weren’t deployed.One flap is being withheld by French authorities as they carry out their own criminal investigation.But a second flap that washed up in Tanzania in 2016 shows it was “probably not deployed”, according to Australian analysts.Mr Foleys agency did confirm that “it’s absolutely evident” someone had initially flown the plane off course, ruling out some mechanical or electrical malfunction.Various governments and private agencies have scoured the ocean for the main wreckage of the doomed flight but have failed to find it.A total of 239 people were on board, including 153 Chinese nationals, 50 Malaysians, seven Indonesians and Australian, French, Canadian, New Zealander, India, Iranian, Dutch, Russian, Taiwanese, Ukrainian and American nationals.Parts of this article originally appeared on News.au"},{"url":null,"title":"red marks girls ankles nursery staff taped shoes on","story":"Jessica Hayes was horrified to discover staff at the North Carolina daycare centre tied the 17-month-olds feet with masking tape because she kept taking them off.She shared images of her daughters skin bulging over the tightly wrapped tape and clear, dark bruising on her feet.Does anyone see an issue with this? she wrote alongside the photos.

This is untrue and is an unwarranted attack on GMP police officers who, as the actual footage showed, acted bravely in response to this horrific attack.The documentary featured unseen mobile phone video and unheard audio recordings, as well as exclusive access to the emergency services.Mr Hopkins said he and his staff were most deeply concerned about the impact on families of viewing this footage.He added: I fail to see any public interest in footage of such an explicit nature being aired with disregard to the feelings of those who matter most.The GMP chief suggested the material in the documentary breached the BBCs editorial guidelines.The programme, at least by inference, wrongly suggested that GMP officers and staff were held back on the night of the attack. This is untrue and is an unwarranted attack on GMP police officers who, as the actual footage showed, acted bravely in response to this horrific attack. At no point were GMP officers and staff held back and they were immediately deployed to the Arena to save life and protect people. In fact, GMPs Force Duty Officer made a decision not to withdraw officers contrary to national plans, a decision highlighted as courageous in the Independent Review into the response to the attack conducted by Lord Kerslake.I want to make it clear that Greater Manchester Police working within the framework of the National Counter Terrorism Network have had primacy over the response to the attack from the moment the attack occurred and the ongoing live criminal investigation. This is not made clear in the documentary and the style of reporting of this is entirely misleading. As the lead police force, for the response and the criminal investigation, GMP has significant constraints on what we can discuss publicly. The production company approached GMP in Autumn 2017 and after a face-to-face meeting we respectfully explained in detail the legal constraints we worked under and highlighted to the production company their own responsibilities. The production company approached us again sometime later and we reaffirmed this constraint and again declined to participate. It is within this context that the reference at the end of the programme that GMP refused to cooperate, is wholly misleading and was focused only on creating journalistic drama rather than accurately portraying the constraints we have repeatedly highlighted. We became aware, just days before the anniversary, that the documentary was going  to be broadcast and this came from a third party who disclosed the potential content of the programme. At this point, we expressed to the BBC our very serious concerns for the families, especially in relation to any footage of the scene that would show victims regardless of whether these were blurred out or not.We also explained again that GMP is leading a live murder investigation and a warrant was issued in October for the arrest of a suspect. We explained this means proceedings have started and as such we are very mindful of undermining a prosecution. In addition to this, we pointed out that there is an ongoing coronial process and we are again very clear that we should not make comment on matters within the jurisdiction of HM Senior Coroner.We asked repeatedly to view the footage so that we could work with the CPS, Coroner and our own family liaison officers to assess what legal implications it may have, but most importantly so that we could inform  and support families. We were not permitted to do this at any point before broadcast. Consequently the first time the investigation team saw the documentary was at the time of its broadcast last night.In the recent independent review into the response to the Arena attack from Lord Kerslake he voiced specific concerns over the conduct of the media in the aftermath of this tragedy and this documentary serves, in my view, to further illustrate the media’s irresponsibility. This documentary, in our view failed to accurately depict the events of the night, and is a partial reconstruction at best. The production company no doubt will say that organisations were offered the chance to cooperate and they chose not to, but these very organisations have an overriding duty to families and the courts and so cannot cooperate with a production company whose only aim is to provide newsworthy viewing at the expense of the families, coronial process and indeed a criminal trial.Most importantly when I became aware of the content of this documentary, my staff and I were most deeply concerned about the impact on families of viewing this footage. I fail to see any public interest in footage of such an explicit nature being aired with disregard to the feelings of those who matter most. Whether families wish to view such footage is a private matter and is not something that should be publicly aired on national television taking away any choice. Some families are left with the question -  is this my loved one on the floor?.Before the broadcast, I am aware that the CPS and the Coroner expressed serious reservations. I am also aware that having understood the potential enormity of the impact of the programme British Transport Police withdrew support and refused the BBC authority to use the material. Despite all this the broadcast went ahead.The duty of Greater Manchester Police is to support the families, search for evidence of what happened and present this evidence objectively to the courts. This takes time, there is an ongoing extradition process good reason for us being unable to provide detail. Thankfully the vast majority of the media understand and respect this. The broadcast of this programme and the material within it appears to breach the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines.This documentary however, is in our view entirely inappropriate and I deeply regret the impact the actions of the production company and the BBC may have on those who matter most - the victims’ families and survivors of one of the worst terrorist attacks this country has ever seenYours sincerely,Ian Hopkins, QPMChief ConstableGreater Manchester PoliceA BBC Spokesperson said: “The production company worked constructively and appropriately with Victim Support, and the sensitivities of all those involved in this tragic event were subject to careful consideration throughout the production process.This was a responsible, accurate and thoughtful documentary which was an important piece of public service broadcasting. The programme team took considerable care to minimise offence whilst accurately portraying the severity of events.”Featuring interviews with counter-terrorism police and friends of Manchester-born bomber Salman Abedi, the film also explored what could have driven him to kill.He grew up in Britain, where his friends claim he lived a wild youth of booze and drug-taking, but his parents are originally from Libya.The killer is thought to have visited the North African country – a haven for ISIS fighters – regularly in the six years leading up to the Manchester bombing.It was claimed he rang his nuclear scientist mum Samia moments before detonating the rucksack bomb to say: Forgive me.Yesterday, the people of Manchester fell silent as bells rang out across the city at 10.31pm to mark the exact time of the attack one year ago.Thousands gathered in the darkness of St Ann’s Square on Tuesday night, where moving song lyrics were projected onto the side of the church.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them.

The response was phenomenal with over 100,000 people replying, making it the largest survey of LGBT people anywhere in the world.  “One answer that stood out to me was how many LGBT people said they avoided being open about their sexual orientation or gender identity in public, or with their own family and friends. I want to help make us a country where no one feels the need to hide who they are or who they love. “We will publish the full results soon. And while these findings might not come as news to many in the community, they do allow government to focus on what more it needs to do to tackle discrimination in every walk of life. Whether that is at home, in the playground, in the workplace, or in public.” She added: “That is why we will also publish an LGBT Action Plan this summer.  It will set out concrete steps the Government will take to improve lives for LGBT people in this country and address some of the injustices the community has faced.” Labour’s Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities said the Prime Minister’s words did not go far enough.

SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford said that the Windrush Scandal had revealed that the Tories\u0027 immigration crackdown has targeted those who legally live here. And he raised the plight of young people who have grown up in the UK and know of nothing else face losing their lawful settled status because they simply cannot afford the paperwork. Mr Blackford, who has been damning in his criticism of the Government\u0027s attitude to immigrants, raised the issue at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions. Speaking in the House of Commons he warned that they are struggling to find the money to secure their immigration status because Home Office fees have increased by 148% since 2014.  These children have the right to be here the UK is their home, he said. I am giving the Prime Minister the opportunity today: will she scrap these fees for young people, as she has done for the Windrush generation? The Prime Minister insisted that a minor who has indefinite leave to remain will have access to benefits and entitlements which put them on an equal footing to their British citizen peers, so a grant of British citizenship is not therefore required. But Mr Blackford insisted there were about up to 120,000 young people in the UK in this difficult position.  We are talking about young people who live here, who have to wait 10 years and pay up to \u0026pound10,000 to achieve permanent right to remain. It is shocking.  The Government are guilty of creating a generation of undocumented citizens without the rights that many of us take for granted. Will the Prime Minister change her policies that target young people? The Prime Minister said she did not recognise the \u0026pound10,000 figure he quoted. And she repeated the point that a minor who has indefinite leave to remain will have access to the benefits and entitlements that put them on an equal footing to their British citizen peers. A grant of British citizenship is not required in order for someone to access those rights and benefits.

She was urged to speak out after American billionaire Shahid Khan tabled a multi-million pound bid for the national stadium. Mr Khan owns the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL American football team, and wants to make Wembley their official home.  It would be the first NFL side to be based outside of the US in a deal reportedly worth \u0026pound1bn. But speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour’s Justin Madders said: I\u0027m sure the Prime Minister, like millions of other people, was glued to her TV set on Saturday watching an event of national importance. Sadly, there was not a fairytale ending, as Chelsea won the FA Cup.  But that could be the last FA Cup final played at Wembley before it is sold to an overseas owner. When Premier League clubs spend hundreds of millions of pounds every year on wages and transfers, does the Prime Minister agree with me that there is actually more than enough money in the game for there to be no need to sell off this iconic national asset? The Prime Minister said: Can I say to him, that is a decision for the owners of Wembley. It is a private matter, it is not a matter for the Government.  Labour deputy leader Tom Watson blasted May’s response. He said: “The sale of Wembley is not a \u0027private matter\u0027 as Theresa May has just said at PMQs. It\u0027s our national stadium and fans have to be heard. We are deeply sceptical of the proposal to sell Wembley.

Emmanuel Elliott, 81, and partner, Hilda Farmer, 79, had parked their Ford Fiesta somewhere near Cheltenham General Hospital in Gloucestershire on Friday afternoon for Emmanuel to attend an appointment. Hilda said she dropped her partner at the entrance and then found a parking spot within a mile and a half of the building, on a street she thought had nice houses on one side. When the couple returned from their appointment, however, their car was nowhere to be found.  Family and friends spent days trawling the nearby streets without success in an attempt to help the Gloucester couple find the vehicle - they even offered a reward on Tuesday of \u0026pound100 to anyone who could locate it. The Fiesta was discovered a day later in the St George\u0027s Road car park about 900 metres from the hospital and had been ticketed three times by wardens. Hilda said she must have dreamt she parked it beside houses. She said her granddaughter played a major role in locating the car after launching a public appeal on social media for locals to keep an eye out for the silver Fiesta.  The post went viral and attracted the attention of local news outlets, with several people soon contacting media to say they had seen the car. The relieved couple\u0027s reunion with their vehicle was filmed by TV crews who had published stories in the days prior about the parking mystery.  Hilda told Gloucestershire Live : It feels crazy. Aren\u0027t we lucky to live in a country where an old aged pensioner\u0027s car gets national news coverage? Thank God we live in England.  My granddaughter has got hundreds of people on her Facebook. She put the appeal on there and someone has seen the car. We\u0027re really happy because it\u0027s the only car we have got. We had to go on our bikes yesterday. I prefer riding my bike to driving a car, but there are some things you can\u0027t do without a car. Emmanuel told the BBC it was marvellous to have found it.

Of course I believe in equality of men and women which, by definition, makes me a feminist. But I’ve always felt excluded from feminism and feminist debates because they’re always dominated by one voice – well-off middle-class women. Instead of being inclusive, it is exclusive and rarely addresses the views and needs of ethnic minority or working-class women. It seems those who benefit most are usually already well paid and well connected. I’ve been to networking events about gender equality in business or the media and I can usually count the number of non-white women on one hand. During panel discussions I never hear anyone talking about tackling the lack of social or racial diversity. Instead it’s a certain group of women fighting for women like themselves. Women of colour have fought against sexism and racism, but their voice is rarely heard. I believe Meghan can change that. Yes she’s well-off and privileged, but her background, and the fact she was raised by a black woman, gives her a different perspective.  As her bio says, she’s had a keen awareness of social issues from an early age, instilled by her wonderful mother Doria Ragland . “Those early experiences helped shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment,” it says.

Leah was just 17 years old when the coaster crashed into a test car, crushing her leg amongst the twisted metal of the ride. Brave Leah was taken to hospital where doctors failed to save her injured leg. Now, three years on, Leah, from Barnsley in South Yorkshire, has shared footage of her running for the very first time. She shared a video of her smiling while running alongside her physio Carolyn - captioning the clip: \u0027This is my first time running since my accident. it felt amazing\u0027. Leah was on a first date with her now long-term boyfriend Joe Pugh on the day of the crash.  Joe today congratulated Leah on the milestone moment, tweeting: YES GAL. Such a achievement.    Leah spoke earlier this year about the horrific accident and the moment doctors told her they had to remove her leg. Describing the ill-fated rollercoaster ride to Cosmopolitan, Leah said: I started yelling, no no no, and then...there was nothing. Only blackness, The next thing I remember was the screaming and the blood. There was so much of it. The metal of the safety bars had folded into our bodies. When she was finally freed Leah was taken to hospital, but doctors could not save her leg. The doctor came over in a white coat, she told Cosmo. He had kind, sad eyes and spoke to me slowly.  \u0027I’m so sorry. I had to amputate your left leg. It was seriously injured. It was the only way I could save you.\u0027 The 24-year-old has started blog, Limbitless , and documented her journey from being afraid she might not be able to run, to ordering prosthetics blades and taking on a 10k race. “Everybody is unique and people should be proud of that. I would love to help other people and that is my aim really. It not only helps them but helps me too.” Last year Leah posted a series of stunning pictures from her summer holiday with Joe, showing her full prosthetic leg while wearing a bikini.

Kelsie Murphy was celebrating her birthday when the test centre contacted her and told her there had been an admin error. The 22-year-old says her examiner had gone through the test paper with her after she took the exam in Herne Bay, Kent, last month. She says he showed her she had received only six minors and told her: You’ve got yourself an early birthday present- you’ve passed! Kelsie was so delighted she was almost in tears - but her happiness turned to confusion when the test centre got in touch the next day.  She says she was told to return her pass certificate, with a major error having been recorded during her driving test on April 11. It remains unclear how she ended up being given an initial \u0027pass\u0027 result - but the centre has said there was an administrative error. It is thought she is the first person in Britain to have had their licence revoked before even receiving it. Kelsie said: “I have no idea where the major mark came from. As far as I knew, everything had gone smoothly. I feel like the unluckiest person ever because they told me it hasn’t happened to anyone but me.”  The mum-of-two had thought she had passed with half a dozen minors after taking the test at Herne Bay driving test centre. Drivers must have fewer than 15 minor faults and no major errors to pass and be issued with their interim driving licence. Kelsie claimed: “My examiner said ‘congratulations you’ve got yourself an early birthday present- you’ve passed!’ “I was so happy, nearly crying, but holding myself back because I didn’t want to embarrass myself. “I’ve been through a lot in my life and I was over the moon that things were finally going well for me.  “My driving instructor came running over to me because she could see the smile on my face. “The examiner went through the paper with us, showing me that I only had six minors.” Kelsie, from Broadstairs, Kent, was ecstatic to have \u0027passed\u0027 the test after previously failing on her first attempt. She returned home to celebrate with her family and friends, where she was greeted with congratulatory balloons, banners and cards. Her mum had helped her to buy a car, and she sent her papers off to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to get her driving licence. But a day later, while celebrating her birthday, she received a call from the test centre asking her to return the pass certificate to them.  Shockingly, she says they then told her she hadn’t passed after all. A letter addressed to Kelsie, from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency’s (DVSA) Operational Delivery Manager, Mark Aston, said a serious fault had been recorded during her test. The letter, dated April 14, read: “After your test on Wednesday 11th April at 13:35 our in-house checks identified a serious fault had been assessed and recorded during your test but due to an administrative error, your examiner issued a pass. “You can only pass your test if you receive fewer than 15 driving faults and there are no serious or dangerous faults recorded. “With this in mind, I am sorry to confirm that you have not passed your driving test and that you should only be driving in accordance with the provisional licence regulations.” It added: “Finally, please accept my sincere apologies for any upset and inconvenience that this error may have caused.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding facts figures cake","story":"NewsRoyal Wedding facts and figures: From the cake, to the cost and big moments you may have missedNow we\u0027ve had time to process everything that happened on the big day, we look at the facts and figures from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s big day\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJo-Anne RowneyDeputy Audience Growth Editor17:26, 23 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email It was to be expected, but Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day was a huge undertaking - taking a massive amount of time, money and teamwork to make it all come together.  The couple tied the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel on May 19 in an extravagant - but touching - ceremony. Their family and friends gathered - along with millions of people around the world - to see the happy pair say I do. With so much going on though you may have missed a few things. It\u0027s a little frightening when you consider how much work went into a single day. We\u0027ve taken a look at the facts and figures to break it all down for you. Meghan followed in Princess Diana\u0027s footsteps Harry and Meghan read traditional vows from the Common Book of Prayer, though Meghan left out the word obey - just like Diana did. Kate Middleton also left the word out when she married William in 2011. Meghan made history  Meghan began her wedding procession alone - after her father remained in the USA or an operation - though she was joined by Prince Charles at the Quire. She\u0027s the first royal bride to walk down the aisle without an escort. Meghan and Harry got new titles Hours before the wedding, the Queen announced they were now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. There were a ton of celebs at the wedding and reception  David and Victoria Beckham were there, as were Amal and George Clooney. James Corden rocked up with his wife, and compered the reception later, even getting the royals to dance off. Meghan\u0027s friends, including Serena Williams, Priyanka Chopra and her Suits co-stars also were invited to the wedding.  Harry\u0027s exes were at the wedding Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davis both attended, but everyone was fine with it, because that\u0027s what the royals do. Meghan\u0027s veil had intricate details  The 15-ft long veil was designed by Givenchy\u0027s Clare Waight Keller. She had flowers for every single commonwealth country as per Meghan\u0027s request. Meghan had two dresses The first was by Givenchy, the second was by Stella McCartney and was more Hollywood in its look - a lily white halter neck. Meghan wore shoes from Aquazurra made in silky satin, with nude mesh and soles painted in baby blue.  Meghan\u0027s tiara was her something old She wore Queen Mary\u0027s old tiara which was lent to her by Queen Elizabeth II. She deliberately had subtle make up Just like Kate, Meghan had her close friends do her makeup rather than a professional.  Meghan\u0027s dad wasn\u0027t there Thomas Markle Snr had causes quite the drama beforehand. He was set to attend the wedding, but caused controversy when it was revealed pap pictures of him reading a book about London and googling his daughter were set up. It later emerged he needed a heart operation and would be unable to fly to the wedding or walk Meghan down the aisle. He told TMZ: My baby looks beautiful, and she looks very happy. He added: I wish I were there, and I wish them all my love and happiness.  Though her mum was - and alone   Doria Ragland sat alone, though it\u0027s thought the Bride and Groom sorted the seating. Harry\u0027s family were on the right, Meghan\u0027s on the left. She had a tear in her eye as she watched her daughter get married. What Harry said to Charles When Prince Charles reached Harry at the altar , Harry looked at him and said: Thank you, Pa. The entertainment in the church was amazing There were 23 boy choristers from St George\u0027s School as well as Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the 19-year-old who won BBC Young Musician of the Year, who was the cellist at the wedding. There was also a gospel choir who sang Etta James and Stand By Me. There were twins as page boys  The son of Meghan\u0027s best friend Jessica were page boys - Brian and John held her veil and looked very excited about it all. Prince George was also a page boy and his sister Charlotte was a bridesmaid. There were no adult bridemaids.  There was an A-list guestlist 600 invitations were made by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood for the event, though only 200 were invited to Frogmore House. The couple also invited members of the public, with 2,640 people getting an invite. Made up of 1,200 nominated by nine regional Lord Lieutenent officers 200 people from charities and organisations 100 pupils from local schools the Royal School and St George\u0027s School 610 Windsor Castle\u0027s community members 530 members of the Royal Households and Crown Estate. Bishop Michael Curry went down a storm  The preacher gave a stirring sermon, that had the royals looking a little shocked. People seemed to love it though, and the message about civil rights, love and the power to change the world. It was a big logistical event Volunteers helped out on the day, with 140 Royal Borough Ambassadors stewarding. It cost \u0026pound30 to park at the Review Ground on the day, and there were 6,000 spots. Security operation About \u0026pound30m was spent on security for the wedding. The Met Police identified 160 \u0027stalkers\u0027 before the event.  TV channels All the channels from around the world descended on Windsor. Most impressive though was Sky who laid 27km of cable to broadcast the coverage in UHD, making them the first broadcaster to televise it in 4k. Their first dance was to Whitney Houston They went for something a bit different and had I Wanna Dance With Somebody - instead of dancing alone they invited their guests to the dancefloor with them. They went into a bit of jive and lindy hop. Jaguar E-Type  The number plate was the date of the wedding. The car was a silver blue classic convertible Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, originally made in 1968 but made into an electric car. The reception was at Frogmore House ...so called because of the frogs that live in the low lying marshy area. It\u0027s only open on three ticketed charity days. Guests partied in a glass marquee, it was also where they had their sit down meal.  The cake was massive There was quite an ingredients list for the cake.   The flowers were donated to a hospice  Floral designer Phillippa Craddock directed a team, including florists from St George\u0027s Chapel and Buckingham Palace, to create the wedding displays. The flowers have gone to St Joseph\u0027s Hospice in Hackney, East London.   They had a great evening reception  There\u0027s so many details from the reception we gathered them all together in our behind-the-scenes break down of what happened . Highlights included a firework display at 11pm, George Clooney dancing with Meghan, but being shunned by Fergie and a special cocktail being created for Harry with ginger in it as a nod to his red hair.  Dirty burgers were served with candyfloss. Serena Williams played beer pong Apparently she played it like it was tennis.  Idris Elba had a turn on the decks While DJ Sam Totolee provided the music in the main, Idis did a stint as well. Think 80s and R\u0026ampB. Elton John sang a Disney song  He also sang Tiny Dancer, Your Song, and I\u0027m Still Standing. The Disney song was Circle of Life. Meghan gave a speech Harry gave a speech as did Prince William, where he teased his brother, but Meghan also stood up to talk. She thanked Charles for walking her down the aisle and for such a warm welcome. Awww.

Her eyes were closed and she seemed peacefully asleep, with fairy lights around her bed as her favourite music played softly in the background. The image still brings so much comfort to her mum Stephanie because, tragically, Daisy wasn’t asleep, she had died at the age of just 12. It was thanks to a special mattress Stephanie was able to collect such precious memories during a week with her little girl after she had passed away. For the mum and her three other children, being able to say goodbye to Daisy in their own home was crucial to the grieving process.  “She just looked like she was asleep,” the 49-year-old mum says. “It was amazing to be able to feel like she was with us. You have these visions of her looking like something from Silent Witness, lying there in the mortuary, but it was just like having her home again.” Daisy died in 2017 of a rare condition called Costello syndrome, which affects fewer than 300 children worldwide. It is caused by a mutation of a cancer- causing gene, which meant Daisy had a 17% increased risk of developing a cancerous tumour, heart and bone problems. She lived longer than doctors expected but eventually it was too much for her body to cope with. After she died, Daisy’s family were able to take her home to Wimbledon, South West London, for an extra week before they laid her to rest because of the special cold mattress. “When Daisy came home she was in her nightie, we put her duvet on her and tucked her toys around her,” Stephanie says. “I played her music, the soundtrack to Frozen, we had some candles on. My children and I just drifted in and out of her room. It was like she was sleeping. But I did keep expecting her to wake up and say ‘go away!’  “People might hear that and say, ‘Oh my God, that’s really freaky’, but it felt like the most natural thing in the world. I felt I’d reclaimed her. I’d brought her away from a traumatic death and a medical environment and she was just my little girl tucked up in bed.” The technology is not widely available but a small number of hospices have the mattresses. Stephanie, a writer and campaigner, explains: “It’s a blue, plastic-coated mattress and it has cooling fluid and is attached to a tube. It acts like a padded fridge or a freezer block, you put that on the bed and put normal bedding over the top. “I was astounded that there is very little information about these cold mattresses. If Daisy had been under a different hospice, we wouldn’t have been able to take her home after she died. “The most horrific thing for me is that she would’ve had to go to the mortuary. Embalming was the other option, which is horrible. How horrific – you’ve just lost a child and then have to go through that. “The mattresses seem to be really rare, we were so lucky our hospice uses them.” They took Daisy home for a night and then spent seven nights with her at Shooting Star Chase children’s hospice, where she spent so much of her life.  It has been a traumatic couple of years for the family. Stephanie’s husband of 23 years Andy died from cancer a year before Daisy in December 2015, leaving Stephanie as a single mum to Daisy, Theo, 21, Xanthe, 19, and Jules, 15. Being able to spend the extra time with Daisy has been hugely beneficial to them all. Theo and Jules decided that the night with Daisy at home brought them enough closure, but Stephanie and Xanthe spent the rest of the week with her in the hospice, where they re-created Daisy’s bedroom. Stephanie says: “My other daughter spent so much time with Daisy in the hospice, she painted her nails, did her make-up. After Andy died, she didn’t want to be there right at the end. “But actually with Daisy, she said being able to spend time with her and dress her up in her favourite Princess Anna dress, from Frozen, and put all her toys around her was so healing.” Now Stephanie is able to remember her daughter at peace. “Daisy looked so relaxed at the end,” she says. “She had been in a lot of pain for the last few months of her life and was very tense. When she died, we all said how long she looked because she wasn’t tense any more. “In my mind I have that beautiful picture, not on a ventilator and bloated from the fluid, with tubes everywhere. “I have a nice picture. Had I not been able to have that, my last memory of her would’ve been before she went to the mortuary.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what princess dianas lover james","story":"NewsWhat Princess Diana\u0027s lover James Hewitt was doing on Prince Harry\u0027s wedding dayFormer army officer James Hewitt spent the day of Prince Harry\u0027s wedding shopping in Exeter\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByIsaac Crowson13:59, 23 MAY 2018Updated01:31, 24 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrincess Diana\u0027s former lover James Hewitt spent Prince Harry\u0027s wedding day doing his weekly shop, it has emerged.

Charlotte Bonwick, who has a permanent stoma bag and is fed through a tube, claims she was told by the service to instead get her clean needles from an exchange usually reserved for drug addicts. The 23-year-old, who was born with her intestines outside her body, needs to inject medication every eight hours to stabilise her body, which has been ravaged by sepsis a shocking six times. The West Sussex woman claims she was recently told by her doctor she could no longer have a NHS script for hypodermic syringes.  She also says her regular prescription for anti-sickness drug, Cyclizine, which she needs to inject to help keep water down and weight on, had been reduced to meagre rations and was having negative impacts on her health. Due to absorption problems, I cannot just take a tablet. I have to have medication in other forms, eg. patches which stick onto the skin and release the drug, injections, medication that melts under the tongue, IV through my central line. These medications are so important when trying to live life as normal as possible. Too fearful to visit a needle exchange, the young woman, who is so ill she cannot work, has begun borrowing money from her parents to afford the \u0026pound500-a-month private prescription for syringes. She said: This whole thing came out of the blue, I had no warning whatsoever - it\u0027s made me really upset because now I can\u0027t rely on them.  Whenever I went to go and pick up my prescription they said they lost it - that\u0027s how it started. They couldn\u0027t tell me where the prescription was - it came across a bit strange. I have been on drugs since I was born - it seems they are just phasing me out, they told me that the drugs were just too expensive, but these are the only ones that work.” How am I supposed to take my medication.  Free charity needle exchanges are usually set up to improve the health of drug addicts by giving them a free way to get new needles, rather than having to share. She contacted Mid Sussex East Shoreham CCG to raise her issue . She added: They told me to go the needle exchange.

Until now mystery has surrounded its theft, and what happened to the precious cup in the week before it was found again by a dog called Pickles. But now, with the 2018 World Cup just 22 days away, our investigation tells for the first time the story behind one of the world’s most notorious thefts.   \u0027He was thieving from a young age\u0027: The life and crimes of the man who stole the 1966 World Cup  Armed robber Sidney, then 40, stole the trophy with the help of brother Reg, say three independent sources with knowledge of the heist including Reg’s son Gary. And he did it just for fun, says Gary, who decided to tell the story after he was approached by the Mirror. He said: “Sidney just nicked it for the thrill – not for financial gain, but just because it was so easy.” It led to one of the biggest manhunts in Scotland Yard’s history and became a bigger story than that year’s general election. But Cugullere died of cancer in 2005, aged 79, having never been caught.  Only a handful of relatives, friends and gangland figures have known the truth. One source said: “Many a time Sid would say he was the first Englishman to lift the World Cup in 1996 and that he did it before Bobby Moore. “He was an opportunist and the stealing of the Cup was just that. He didn’t have any inside information or help from the guards. It was spur of the moment.” He had tried to extort a ransom of \u0026pound15,000 for the trophy with the help of pal Ted Betchley, but the plan went wrong after his friend was arrested. Yet still he was not exposed as the culprit.   The Mirror has spent 10 months tracing Cugullere’s history and family after a source disclosed the thief was a man named “Sidney Coo”. Using interviews with insiders, police files and National Archives records we pieced together the most complete picture so far of what happened. Cugullere, jailed for more than 25 years for other offences, took the winged Greek goddess figurine on Sunday 20 March 1966 from the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster, Central London.   History of Jules Rimet trophy as mystery behind stolen 1966 World Cup revealed  It was insured for \u0026pound30,000 and was being exhibited in a glass cabinet by the Stanley Gibbons stamp company. Sir Stanley Rous, the president of FIFA, had only agreed to it being released from the FA headquarters on condition it was watched 24 hours a day. The exhibition was closed on the Sunday and there were four guards on duty, split into two pairs. One source said Cugullere told him in the 1980s how he had pulled off the burglary. He had driven to Westminster from his home in Walworth, South East London, to case out security after hearing the Cup was on display there.  Wearing a brown removals-style coat he walked into the area open to the public and went to the locked room where the trophy was housed in a padlocked cabinet. The source said: “There were those door handles you get on schools, the large metal ones, and he realised he could unscrew them and get in. The handle fell and was hanging there.”  The handles were holding a wooden bar across the rear doors. Once removed, Cugullere could get inside. The insider said: “Sid had a bag with his tools including bolt cutters. “He said he couldn’t believe it was just in a glass-fronted wooden cabinet with a chain and a little Woolworths padlock on it, and no security watching it. He cut the chain and in seconds got the cabinet open. When he got it out, he braced himself to lift it, expecting it to be very heavy.  “But he said it was so light it was untrue. He said it wouldn’t have made much as scrap in them days.” Cugullere then put the trophy in his bag and walked out. Gary says his father Reg told him he was also in the Methodist Central Hall, but did not see Sidney take the cup. He said: “On the street after coming out of the doors Sid lifted his jacket and said, ‘’Ere you are, Reg, look at this’. He opened one side of his jacket and the World Cup was there.  “My dad went: “F***ing hell, Sid, what the f*** do you think we are going to do with that?” Back at the Methodist Central Hall, security guards were in for a shock. Senior guard Frank Hudson was meant to be keeping a constant eye on the Cup with colleague George Franklin on the first floor. Franklin later told police he checked the Cup at 11am before going for a coffee with Hudson.  At 12.10pm, one of the downstairs guards found the padlock on the case removed and the trophy stolen. The next day police issued a description of a lone thief in his late 30s, around 5ft 10in with sallow skin, dark eyes and greased-down black hair. The description fitted Cugullere. Sidney took the trophy home, but soon realised his wife Nell “would have flung him out” if she found it. So he called Reg, who took it home in his car to Leighton Buzzard, Beds.And that’s when police nearly found the trophy they were all searching for. The source said: “Reggie had it under the front seat. He got pulled at a general stop by the police and they searched the car but didn’t find it.” Rewards totalling \u0026pound5,500 were soon offered for its safe return, far more than Sidney could get if he melted down the 14in gold-plated silver Cup.  DI Len Buggy of the elite Flying Squad led the probe. His break came when the Chelsea and FA chairman Joe Mears was phoned by a man calling himself Jackson, who said a parcel would be arriving the next day. It arrived three days after the theft, on the Wednesday, and contained lining from the trophy and a ransom note demanding \u0026pound15,000 in five and one-pound notes. The note, written by Cugullere, said: “Dear Joe Kno (sic) doubt you view with very much concern the loss of the world cup...to me it is only so much scrap gold.” He said the cup would be “for the POT” if the ransom was not paid. Buggy posed as Mears and arranged to meet “Jackson” in Battersea Park – in fact Sidney’s friend Ted Betchley, 46, a former docker. Betchley was arrested. He insisted he was just the middleman, paid \u0026pound500 for his part, and was jailed for just two years. Gary said soon after the theft Reg and Sidney hid the World Cup in Reg’s father-in-law’s coal shed. He added: “My dad was freaking out and he knew there was no way they could sell the cup. They didn’t melt it down or destroy it because it’s the World Cup. They realised they had to give it back.”  Seven days after the theft, on March 27, docker David Corbett was taking his cross-bred collie Pickles for a walk when he spotted the cup in the street. It remains unclear how it got there. Corbett collected \u0026pound6,000 in rewards. Bobby Moore went on to lift the Cup after England defeated Germany 4-2 in the eighth World Cup final.

She is reported to have gone into the fast food restaurant after a night of partying. The woman is wearing a sheer top and tiny black skirt that is hitched up around her waist. German newspaper Bild said she was filmed in the Majorcan town of Inca at 11am on Sunday. Majorcan newspaper Ultima Hora also carried the picture, linking it to the drunken tourism the island is fighting against. The newspaper also mentioned the party resort Magaluf , which is 29 miles away from Inca. Inca is in the centre of the island and is not a mass tourism hotspot.  Bild claimed the woman was with with two friends and needed the burger as a hangover cure and headlined its article “This is how you ask for a hamburger in Majorca”. It added: “Her already tight skirt has probably slipped over her buttocks.”  It was previously reported how boozy British tourists had been warned to think twice before stripping naked in Magaluf as they could be fined hundreds of pounds. Officials on the Spanish island introduced new laws in 2015 to clean up its image as a wild party town for stag and hen dos and tanked-up teens.  Anyone found committing alcohol-fuelled rowdy acts like balcony hopping, urinating in public and skinny-dipping can now be given an on-the-spot fine. CCTV and police patrols were also beefed up, as well as a ban on drinking in the street between 10pm and 8am, and shops can no longer sell booze after midnight. Anyone found urinating in the street and being naked in public could be made to pay €750 (\u0026pound658). Spanish authorities have been cracking down on unruly behaviour on the streets of Magaluf in recent years.  In April it was reported Magaluf cops have banned a pub crawl by 90 boozy Brits in a clampdown on “uncivic” behaviour. Police said the outing was “totally against” regulations put in place to combat public drunkenness by visitors to the popular tourist island. The bar crawl promised drinking games, an open bar and a bucking bronco for revellers. The group, which was led by two guides from Ireland, was visiting its second pub in the Punta Ballena area of the city when police intervened.

It wasn’t exactly encouraging.\u0026#8221Mark was 19 when he left Dundee and decided to travel Europe by rail, and it was those experiences that prompted him to write a book, titled Changing Trains.\u0026#8220The main character in the story is Sam, but much of it is based on my own experiences travelling alone in Europe in 1985,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’m a big fan of the novelist Christopher Isherwood, whose books formed the basis for the film Cabaret.\u0026#8220My title is a nod to his book Mr Norris Changes Trains.\u0026#8220Isherwood’s Fraulein Schroeder is remembered in my book as Madame Gilbert and all the young female characters that Sam encounters in my book kind of collectively represent Isherwood’s Sally Bowles.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220When I travelled across Europe in 1985, we were still in the cold war era \u0026#8211 weird to think we could heading that way again now \u0026#8211 and it was pre-Shengen, so I had to go through border controls as I entered and left each country and there was no euro at this point, so I had to get my head around constantly changing my currencies \u0026#8211 pounds to francs to pesetas to lira. This is all described in the book, and I have a little fun with it.\u0026#8221Mark began writing the book in 2010, while he was travelling between his work in London and a small house in France.\u0026#8220I’m a huge fan of Ian Fleming’s James Bond stories and when I travelled to places like Paris, Monte Carlo, Venice and the French Riviera \u0026#8211 all places that have appeared in Fleming’s novels \u0026#8211 it really felt like you were in the world of Bond, so I play with this a bit too,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And when I went Interrailing, I travelled \u0026#8211 as everyone did back then \u0026#8211 with a number of compilation tapes for my Walkman, so the soundtrack to the book is also very 80s.\u0026#8220Everything from Duran Duran’s Bond theme ‘A View to a Kill’ to Simple Minds’ Glittering Prize album. Fab music.\u0026#8221The story starts in Dundee, and Mark said it was central to the story of Sam\u0026#8217s journey from uncertain, undecided small-town boy to a modern, outward-looking European with a sense of direction in his life.\u0026#8220Once the main character Sam has left Dundee and is discovering new cities like Paris, Barcelona and Monte Carlo, he often compares them with his origins. His experience of ‘otherness’ opens new possibilities to him, ones that weren’t available in Dundee at that time,\u0026#8221 Mark said.He initially started looking for a publisher for the book but decided instead to self-publish and said the reviews had been great.\u0026#8220I’ve been amazed at how many people have said it really took them back to that period and reminded them of their own lives back then. I love that it resonates with them,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’ve also done some readings in London and a few guest spots on blogs.

career at Dens Park.The 19-year-old, signed from Port Vale two years ago, impressed manager Neil McCann enough to see him made second-choice behind Elliott Parish, despite the signing of Jeremy Malherbe in January.That brought a debut at Ibrox in April after Parish was hurt late on before Ferrie was rewarded with a new contract and then his first start on the final day of the season.That ended in frustration for the Dark Blues as they were beaten 1-0 by Partick Thistle after a limp performance and left Ferrie “annoyed” that his hopes of keeping a clean sheet had been dashed.He said: “The result wasn’t what we wanted and we could have done better.“However, on a personal note it was a great achievement to play and I feel I did alright.“It was a good confidence booster for myself to get that full start under my belt, I really enjoyed it.“It’s always frustrating as a keeper because you can’t really influence the play in front of you.“That’s just the life of the goalkeeper – it can be a lonely position. Sometimes you just have to look after yourself, make sure you give your team the best chance to go and win a game by making saves when you need to.“All I did really in that Partick game was do my job.“I conceded a goal which is very annoying because I just want to keep clean sheets – that’s what goalkeepers are built on.“I wasn’t happy about that but, overall, it was a pleasing performance for myself.”And Ferrie did impress, making timely saves as well as commanding his area with Partick quickly putting the rookie keeper under pressure from the off.An early save that saw him claw an Adam Barton header out of the top corner set him on his way and, although he couldn’t stop Kris Doolan poking in the winner, he was happy with this performance.On that Barton header: “It had me worried when it was looping over me! I was thinking ‘oh, no, it’s looping, it’s looping, please get there!’“I managed to just get there and then, after that, there was a corner and with a young keeper they were going to put it on me. That’s what anyone does with a young keeper, and I got a good punch on it.“I felt that was important because it meant they maybe didn’t put it on me as much. I found in the second half they didn’t. The crosses were a bit further out, which was good.“Teams might look at that because I’m maybe not as big as other goalkeepers. I’m 6ft 1in but it doesn’t matter, you just have to be dominant and you get yourself out for crosses.“I’ve always tried to do that because I always think if you attack it 100% you can get there even if they are six foot seven or eight.“If you want that ball more than them then you can go get it.”His displays in training and for the successful U/20 side, saw him handed another year’s deal by Dundee and Ferrie is determined to make the most of the chance he’s been given.He added: “It was good to get that signed, get secure for next year knowing I can come back and work 100% again to make sure that gets me as far as I can go.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/SMac_Invertay_House_Maule_Monifieth17100501.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"fresh hope of building facility for local community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to build a new community centre in the local area could be back on the table.The Monifieth Community Resource Group (MCRG) suffered a huge setback in March when a £1 million request to the Big Lottery Fund to refurbish Invertay House was rejected.The former school building was earmarked to be turned into a multi- purpose centre to hold sports and community events.Angus Council had most recently used the premises to process benefit inquiries, but agreed to the community asset transfer in August last year.Jean Lee, chairwoman of MCRG, said: “Before Invertay House was declared surplus to requirements by Angus Council, and we began the whole process, we had done a huge amount of work on the potential development of a community hub on land beside the Blue Seaway.\u0026#8220We were at the stage of being ready to apply to the Big Lottery for funding. Our plans were well advanced and we were very enthusiastic about them.“However, the decision was made to shelve those plans and pursue the option of Invertay House because it was accepted it had always been first choice of building by the community.”However, £2m was needed to realise the ambition, and with the Big Lottery grant application having been turned down, the MCRG is now considering the previous plan to build a brand new facility in the Blue Seaway park area, near to the waterfront, in conjunction with Monifieth Athletic FC.Jean said: “The Blue Seaway option is now again our best option.“We can have a fit-for-purpose building in a magnificent setting – a building that provides for local groups, community events and individuals who just want to have somewhere to socialise, an activities space that will ensure the viability of the whole community project.“Monifieth needs this building and we are ready again to start work on making it happen. We have had very positive preliminary discussions with Monifieth Athletic to take this forward as a joint project.“They had ambitions to create a sports hub down at the riverfront and we had always shared the understanding that we would support them in this ambition after we had secured our community centre. To ensure that Monifieth gets the best that’s possible we will work together in the spirit of joint compromise.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03e9f0f1800-846x564.jpg ","title":"hero bouncer pulled keys from car as boozy motorist tried to drive off from dundee pub","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA hero doorman chased a drunk driver along a Dundee street and stopped his car — pulling the keys from him to stop him from driving away.The security guard was worried Silviu Palade, 33, would cause an accident and injure people as he was driving on the wrong side of the road and weaving from side to side as he travelled along King Street and on to Fort Street in Broughty Ferry.The doorman leapt into action on Sunday after he saw Palade driving away from the pub he had been drinking in.A roadside breath test revealed Palade was more than six times the legal limit, however he failed to provide further breath tests at police HQ, Dundee Sheriff Court heard.He pleaded guilty to failing to provide two specimens of breath at police HQ on Monday.Fiscal depute Laura Bruce told the court Palade had walked out of the Eagle Inn pub and witnesses saw him going towards a car, getting in and driving away along King Street on the wrong side of the street.She said he then turned the car around and drove back towards the pub and the witnesses, including the doorman, realised the car was all over the road. They started to chase after the car in case he injured someone and the bouncer told him to give him the keys.Police were called and Palade disappeared, however when police attended, he returned with a spare set of keys and tried to get into his car and start it up.Officers prevented him from doing so and a roadside breath test showed a reading of 134 mics. He was then taken to Bell Street HQ but would not agree to provide two further specimens of breath and would not provide any explanation, Mrs Bruce said.Solicitor Nicola Brown told the court Palade had “panicked” when told what the roadside breath test reading was and had failed to provide further tests.She said in terms of the driving offence, he had driven about 300 metres.Ms Brown said he had gone to the pub for a drink with a colleague but ended up consuming far more than he had intended and had foolishly decided to move his car away from the restricted parking area he was in to avoid getting a parking ticket the following day.She said he intended to sell the car to pay for any fine that was imposed.Sheriff Alastair Carmichael fined Palade £800 and banned him from driving for 16 months. The sheriff rejected the crown’s motion for forfeiture of the vehicle.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03ea61a9b1d-846x564.jpg ","title":"locals blame overflowing bins for creating rat haven near busy dundee nightspot","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents have voiced their disgust about overflowing bins that have attracted “massive” rats to their neighbourhood.Seabraes Lane in the West End has been described as a “haven” for vermin, with rats seen just yards away from people’s homes.Several students who live in the block said the issue had been ongoing for several months.Items including sanitary items, rotten food and pizza boxes are discarded on the ground beside eight wheelie bins.The mess is just yards away from eateries and bars along Perth Road.Signs have been erected by tenants at the block requesting that the communal close door is closed at all times.One of the sign states that there are “massive rats outside the building” and urges people to report the matter to Dundee City Council.Rachel Stubbs, 21, a business student, said she had reported the issue to the local authority.She said: “As far as I’m aware, the rubbish is collected once every four weeks.“I sent a complaint in about the matter because it is vile.“People usually walk down the footpath towards Tesco Riverside and I think they are scared they are going to see more vermin.“We’ve placed some signs urging people to recycle as much as possible and close the doors to prevent rats coming into the building.”Another resident, who declined to be named, said a rat roughly the length of a “school ruler” was basking in the sun just yards away from her window.She said: “We saw the rat at the weekend.“My flatmate took a picture of it and someone else saw a dead rat lying in one of the parking bays beside the bins.“The area is a haven for vermin at the moment.”Law student Hannah Paterson, 20, said the ongoing rubbish situation had put her off renewing her lease.She said: “There are about five students in each flat and there simply aren’t enough bins to cope with the demand – we need Eurobins.”A council spokeswoman said: “We are looking into this.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b02998d05dab-854x564.jpg ","title":"return of james keatings gives dundee united early fitness boost","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have been handed an early fitness boost for next season by the return to action of James Keatings.The attacker delayed his summer break to take part in youth coach Dave Bowman’s charity match against a team of fans at Tannadice on Friday night.It was the first time since January he’d kicked a ball in anger and leaves him on course to be ready for the start of pre-season training next month.The man who won promotion from the Championship with Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs was seen as a key signing when he joined after leaving the Hibees last summer.However, the first season of a two-year deal was ruined by a catalogue of injuries.Early in the campaign he was sidelined by an ankle problem and he hasn’t played since being forced out by a groin condition in January.That led to surgery but, in recent weeks, he has been building his fitness and has now reached the stage where he can resume playing.Also turning out for the United greats team on Friday was Craig Easton, with whom talks over a youth coaching role at Tannadice are continuing.Easton taking charge of the development of the club’s young talent remains very much on the cards.The 39-year-old was himself a product of United’s youth policy and went on to make more than 200 appearances for the club before continuing his career with Livingston and then a string of lower division clubs south of the border.Once his playing days were over, he did some coaching in England and, for the past two years, has been in charge of the youths at Raith Rovers. United, meanwhile, are continuing to hold talks with a long list of signing targets for next term.Dunfermline pair Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird could be fixed up this week.And Celtic youngster Sam Wardrop is also expected to join what will be a new-look squad.The 20-year-old played against United last season during a loan spell at Dumbarton that saw him make 27 appearances.United now know all

proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03eb105ae54.jpg ","title":"zimbabwe international striker macauley bonne tops dundee wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the border.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the
