But apparently not.The seeming ease with which Beech was able to fleece the system is there in black and white on his application form, which has been made available by the Crown Prosecution Service. It probably took him no more than 20 minutes to complete. Many of the questions only required ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers. If only tax returns were that straightforward.         Beech received the cash after falsely claiming he had been abused as a child by a VIP paedophile ring         Beech claimed on his form: \u0027My stepfather started to physically and sexually abuse me at the age of seven. And then he gave me to a group of men who continued to hurt me until the age of 15’It has to be acknowledged that CICA operates in a permanent catch-22 situation. It is, on the one hand, dutybound to provide an accessible and victim-centred service. On the other, it is dutybound to carry out rigorous checks and due diligence. It walks a tightrope between compassion and justice, in other words.CICA has an anti-fraud team. And claims do get turned down. Nonetheless, the prevailing culture at CICA, many observers believe, is that it is better that some iniduals like Carl Beech get away with fraud, than real victims be discouraged from coming forward. This, they say, amounts to ‘an open invitation to fraudsters’.All CICA would say on the matter is that, in 201819, the organisation ‘prevented £700,000 worth of fraud’. Not an insignificant sum, until you realise this figure is less than 1 per cent of the £71 million paid out — taxpayers’ money, remember — to alleged sexual abuse victims in 2018 alone. This was a 30 per cent rise on the previous 12-month period.Common sense tells us that the ‘£700,000’ quoted is unlikely to be the extent of criminal activity. In most cases, the decision on whether an application succeeds or not is based overwhelmingly on the testimony (no more than a few paragraphs in the space given on the CICA website’s standard questionnaire) of claimants. On their honesty, to put it bluntly.Awards are made even where no perpetrator has been found, convicted or even identified. The very nature of sexual abuse, especially historical sexual abuse, means that sometimes victims simply don’t know who the perpetrators are. The unintended consequence of trying to help those genuinely harmed is that it also leaves the door ajar for iniduals such as Carl Beech to manipulate the system.         Beech, pictured in Gothenburg before his extradition to the UK, made his compensation claim more than 15 years after the death of his step father Other culprits we highlight today demonstrate that Beech is clearly not an isolated example.Fuelling the compensation industry are countless ‘no win, no fee’ law firms and other claims companies who use crude ‘sexual abuse compensation’ calculators in marketing blurb (minor non-penetrative: £1,000 severe abuse over three years: £6,600 and so on, up to the £44,000 ceiling) to attract clients. ‘We can’t turn back the clock. But we can help you move forward’ is the slogan of one such firm.It’s hardly surprising, then, that claims have soared. Forms like the one Beech filled in are available in the space of just a few clicks.         What Carl Beech wrote on his compensation forms which he used to defraud the state out of £22,000CICA insists applications are thoroughly scrutinised. But claimants are not routinely interviewed in person.The first — some would say only — real check carried out by the CICA is with the police, who have to believe a crime has been committed in order for the claim to succeed.CICA contacted the police in Beech’s case and they told CICA that they believed a crime had been committed, even though there was absolutely nothing to verify his story.If a claimant says physical injuries were sustained, the person’s medical records are obtained from their GP. But that, effectively, is it. Beech, in his form, claimed any physical injuries he had sustained were many years earlier, and had never been reported to a GP.Beech was born in Wrexham, North Wales. But on the form he says that, although he was resident in the UK at the time he claimed he was being abused, he was not a British citizen. That will come as news to most. CICA was unable to provide clarification about this apparent discrepancy, which rather sums up this sorry saga.You do not have to be a British citizen to claim compensation, but you must have been physically or mentally injured as a result of a crime committed in Britain.The questions you have to answer on the form are surprisingly simple. ‘Please provide brief details of the incident,’ Beech was asked, as everyone is.He wrote: ‘My stepfather started to physically and sexually abuse me at the age of seven. And then he gave me to a group of men who continued to hurt me until the age of 15.’ His stepfather died in 1995, nearly 20 years before Carl submitted his form.One of the next questions for claimants concerns injuries. ‘I have ticked “no”,’ Beech wrote, ‘although it is important to know that I suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse and torture ... but no medical treatment was obtained from a GP. One of the group was an army doctor who treated me when they went too far.’Perhaps the two most ‘stringent’ CICA requirements are that claims are filed within a reasonable time (the deadline is flexible in abuse cases) and that the abuse must have been reported to the police.         The £22,000 payment undoubtedly gave Beech added credibility when he met detectives from the Metropolitan police — who did take him seriously       For those with ulterior motives, it’s no problem. Beech’s explanation for the ‘delay in applying for compensation’ was: ‘I had blocked out the abuse since childhood.’ But he confirmed that, ‘yes’, he had now reported the abuse to the police.Beech had gone to Wiltshire police shortly before making his claim. The force took no further action. Even so, what officer in the current climate — when police are encouraged to believe ‘victims’ — would rule out that someone had been abused all those years ago, effectively branding them liars?So when CICA contacted the detective who had interviewed Beech, he backed up his story and said Beech had exhibited a ‘significant degree of psychological suffering’ when he spoke to him. The details emerged during Beech’s trial at Newcastle Crown Court, where he was convicted of fraud and perverting the course of justice on Monday.There is a precedent for the way Wiltshire police appeased Beech by supporting his application with CICA. The force also backed the totally unsubstantiated allegations made against former Prime Minister Ted Heath years after his death in 2005.Around 26 abuse claims made against him were also recorded as alleged crimes, despite the fact that only seven of the accounts were found to be even credible, it was reported at the time.At least two of the complainants who tarnished his reputation applied for compensation from CICA, raising fears that they were financially motivated just like Carl Beech. The letter confirming Beech’s own payment from CICA arrived 17 months after he first applied. He was informed by the official who made the decision: ‘I accept you have suffered psychological trauma and stress as a result of this horrific abuse.’The assessment was based on the ‘balance of probabilities’ that a crime had been committed, not the higher standard of ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ used in criminal law.The £22,000 payment undoubtedly gave Beech added credibility when he met detectives from the Metropolitan police — who did take him seriously.There are a string of similar horror stories, where the taxpayer has been left to foot the bill.         Beech was convicted on Monday of fraud and perverting the course of justice and jailed for 18 years at Newcastle Crown CourtIn 2017, Jemma Beale, 25, was convicted of perjury for fabricating multiple rape allegations which resulted in one man being jailed for seven years. Beale, the court heard, had simply made up the claims for the compensation. She collected £11,000 from CICA.The previous year, Danny Day was revealed to be a fantasist. Day had accused a Dorset fire chief, David Bryant, of raping him in the Seventies. Mr Bryant was found guilty solely on his testimony and spent three years in prison.His conviction was overturned on appeal in 2016, after incriminating medical records were unearthed showing that Day had sought medical help for a decade for being, as he told his GP, a ‘chronic liar’, claiming he was a champion boxer who would have fought in the Olympics if he had not been so traumatised by the rape. He got £11,000 from CICA.But it is the case of retired GP Stephen Glascoe, 68, that has the most striking parallels with the shortcomings exposed by the Carl Beech fiasco.Dr Glascoe was due to stand trial in January 2018, along with four other men, after being falsely accused of being part of a paedophile gang that raped and tortured children in Cardiff in the Nineties.The woman who made the allegations, and cannot be named for legal reasons, turned out to be a ‘serial fantasist’ and the charges were dropped. By then, she had received £22,000 from CICA.Speaking at his home in Cardiff, Dr Glascoe said: ‘I’ve got a problem with the way CICA works. Public money was given to Carl Beech and my accuser. It comes out of government funds and there has been a sharp uptake in the number of complainants. I’m not trying to rubbish genuine victims because sexual abuse of children is real. It happens and the perpetrators should be punished severely.‘But it’s very easy to make up allegations, especially if they are impossible to prove as these were — no CCTV, no chain of emails, no DNA. Everything relies solely on the word of the complainant.‘Once word got out that complainants would be believed and that substantial compensation was available, well, you can work out the implications.’Dr Glascoe and wife Liz, 58, spent £98,000 of their own savings to prove his innocence, employing a QC. He has lobbied his MP for a change in the compensation scheme. He believes the money should be spent on counselling like the German system.‘Genuine victims of horrific sexual crimes need help to come to terms with these things and move on with their lives,’ Dr Glascoe said. ‘The Germans realised that the answer was not to throw money at them. I think there needs to be a Royal Commission or some kind of public inquiry into the way CICA operates.’Additional reporting: Tom Bedford and Tim Stewart "},{"url":null,"title":"How 245 000 year BBC presenter cashed hired speaker bank giant JP Morgan","story":"Share this article Yesterday MPs claimed Mr Sopel has also flouted the broadcaster’s impartiality rules. Tory Andrew Bridgen said: ‘He is in the pocket of JP Morgan. It is difficult to believe, when he has taken money off them, that he can be impartial when he’s reporting on matters that impact Wall Street.’The engagements could also cast doubt over his ability to be impartial when reporting on the US President. Mr Dimon riled Mr Trump last year after claiming at a conference he would beat the President in an election campaign because he is ‘smarter’.         Mr Sopel presided over two sessions at JP Morgan’s Global Markets Conference in Paris in 2017 – which included an interview with Mr Dimon. And in 2016, Mr Sopel appeared at JP Morgan’s Board Summit in New York. Pictured is Mr Sopel giving an off-the-record keynote address at the world\u0027s biggest tobacco company\u0027s Miami conference in AprilMr Trump responded on Twitter, saying Mr Dimon did not have ‘the “smarts”’ and branded him a ‘poor public speaker and nervous mess’.The BBC’s rules state ‘public speaking commitments should not compromise the impartiality’ of the broadcaster.They include a special provision for news and current affairs staff that they ‘should not chair conferences which are a promotional exercise for a commercial company that... is not impartial on a matter of public policy... or any other “controversial subject”.’But yesterday BBC sources said the JP Morgan events did not represent a conflict of interests. A spokesman said: ‘BBC staff are allowed to undertake certain outside engagements which they are required to clear with us, as long as they maintain objectivity and impartiality.’         A BBC spokesman said: ‘BBC staff are allowed to undertake certain outside engagements which they are required to clear with us, as long as they maintain objectivity and impartiality\u0027The JP Morgan events are not the only occasions on which Mr Sopel has accepted a controversial speaking engagement.Earlier this year, he spoke at an event by Philip Morris International, the world’s biggest tobacco company. The ‘open mic’ event was held at a five-star hotel in Miami, where he regaled an audience with his tales of covering the Trump presidency, it was claimed by the cigarette firm staff.Philip Morris told BuzzFeed that Mr Sopel gave ‘a keynote speech on covering the Trump White House’ but claimed it was ‘an internal meeting and an off-the-record discussion’.The arrangement sparked fury both inside and outside the BBC. One radio host said staff were angry that Mr Sopel was ‘foolish’ enough to accept such a controversial gig, amid fears the controversy could lead to a crack-down on the lucrative sideline hundreds of presenters enjoy.The BBC said it did not break rules, but former BBC News director Richard Sambrook said: ‘So is he now prevented from reporting on Big Tobacco? Should be.’This lucrative sideline has helped Mr Sopel fund an enviable lifestyle. He lives in Washington with his wife, but keeps a four-bedroom house in Hampstead worth more than £2million and a £1.2million flat in London’s Belsize Park.  Revealed: BBC presenter Huw Edwards \u0027earns £400,000 in speaking fees for 16 events in five years\u0027 Huw Edwards has raked in an estimated £400,000 in speaking fees in the last five years.The News at Ten anchor has fronted at least 16 events since the start of 2014, and commands fees of up to £25,000 a time.Some of the events are so dull that audiences could be baffled at why Mr Edwards would want to take the work, when he is already paid up to £495,000 a year from licence fee funds.He is also thought to have hosted numerous other events over that period – but the BBC does not make the engagements public or keep a central register so the extent of his moonlighting work is unknown.However it lays bare the scale of the lucrative sideline enjoyed by many BBC presenters. Yesterday, insiders at the corporation said that speaking work is such easy money, it can become addictive.         The News at Ten anchor has fronted at least 16 events since the start of 2014, and commands fees of up to £25,000 a timeOne broadcaster – a household name who has also earned huge sums from public speaking – said the amount of cash on offer for so little effort is too tempting to turn down. He described how writing an article for a national newspaper required a ‘huge’ amount of work, and leaves presenters exposed to criticism if they make a mistake.By contrast, he said that BBC hosts can ‘wheel out the same jokes they have told a thousand times before’ to a conference audience that is unlikely to criticise because they are dazzled by the speaker’s star power. ‘Obviously we are all as venal as anyone else so that is appealing,’ he said.Mr Edwards does not tend to accept money from firms that could be a conflict of interest. He also undertakes charity events for free. However, he has fronted a series of events for railway firms, regional law societies and insurance brokers. The Mail has previously revealed that he has hosted the Concrete Society Awards.This year alone, he has hosted the National Rail Awards in London. He has also fronted events for the Birmingham Law Society, the Women’s Institute and Thames Valley Business Magazine.He also hosted the British Insurance Brokers Association conference where Boris Johnson revealed his ambition to be Prime Minister. Mr Edwards announced the ‘scoop’ on his Instagram account, raising questions over the way public figures could exploit BBC journalists thirsty for speaking fees to make announcements.According to JLA, one of the speakers’ agencies which has him on their books, he charges between £10,000 and £25,000.Yesterday, Mr Edwards said that his speaking fees ‘vary enormously’ and that he does not accept fees for charity events. He added: ‘Like broadcasters from other organisations, I am always happy to host events celebrating the best of British.’The BBC said that none of the events broke its impartiality rules, and that BBC staff are allowed to undertake outside engagements as long as they maintain objectivity and impartiality. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37f7ac856e6abfc7f49444b22a2c875a69cdc3a7/0_278_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04944153c642f28558386d18c95d5ee7","title":"buy a classic guardian photograph piazzetta san marco venice 2010","story":"This week in our  Print Shop series we have an unusual image of Venice, shot by David LeveneWhile covering the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2010, the  photographer David Levene took time out to photograph one of the city’s best-loved tourist spots, St Mark’s Square – and decided to capture a different view of the adjoining Piazzetta.

Katherine Rundell on how the best of them can ignite the imagination of all readers, whatever their ageI have been writing children’s fiction for more than 10 years now, and still I would hesitate to define it it is a slippery, various, quicksilver thing. But I do know, with more certainty than I usually feel about anything, what it is not: it is not exclusively for children. When I write, I write for two people, myself, age 12, and myself, now, and the book has to satisfy two distinct but connected appetites.My 12-year-old self wanted autonomy, peril, justice, food and above all a kind of density of atmosphere into which I could step and be engulfed. My adult self wants all those things, and also: acknowledgments of fear, love, failure. So what I try for when I write – failing often, but trying – is to put down in as few words as I can the things that I most urgently and desperately want children to know and adults to remember.Those of us who write for children are trying to arm them for the life ahead with everything we can find that is true. And perhaps also, secretly, to arm adults against those necessary compromises and heartbreaks that life involves: to remind them that there are and always will be great, sustaining truths to which we can return.When you read a children’s book, you are given the space to read again as a child: to find your way back, back to the time when new discoveries came daily and when the world was colossal, before your imagination was trimmed and neatened, as if it were an optional extra. But imagination is not and never has been optional: it’s at the heart of everything, the thing that allows us to experience the world from the perspectives of others, the condition precedent of love itself. For that we need books that are specifically written to give the heart and mind a galvanic kick – children’s books. Children’s fiction necessitates distillation at its best, it renders in their purest, most archetypal forms hope, hunger, joy, fear. Think of children’s books as literary vodka.Above all, children’s fiction spoke to me, and still speaks to me, of hope. The books say: look, this is what bravery looks like. This is what generosity looks like. They tell me, through the medium of wizards and sexy Jesus lions and talking spiders, that this world we live in is a world of people who tell jokes and work and endure. Children’s books say: the world is huge. They say: hope counts for something, bravery will matter, wit, empathy, love will matter. These things may or may not be true. I hope that they are.WH Auden wrote, in an essay on Lewis Carroll: “There are good books which are only for adults, because their comprehension presupposes adult experiences, but there are no good books which are only for children.” I would not suggest that adults read only, or even primarily, children’s fiction. Just that there are some times in life when it might be the only thing that will do.The Paddington books by Michael Bond There’s a vivid and obvious lesson in Paddington, about refuge. Paddington turns up at our door, with nothing to commend himself but his existence and his excellent hat, and we must take him in. We must cherish him, because he lives – and Michael Bond is telling us, like William Blake before him, that everything that lives is holy.But there’s more: for Bond, I think, structure is a form of metaphor, and the stories can be read as parables. So each inidual Paddington story usually has some kind of mishap: for instance, Paddington drops a sandwich a man slips on it. Disaster! But then the man proves to be a burglar, and his stolen goods spill out at the bear’s feet: triumph! The books tell us that if we zoom out we will see that inside each disaster there is a cog, propelling us towards potential goodness. Baked into the structure of the stories, small as they are, is Bond’s colossal central truth: larger than the world’s chaos are its miracles. Paddington asks us to trust, if only for a brief gasp, for the length of the book, in the world’s essential nobility. The books are oxygen for those, like me, who doubt.His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip PullmanLyra, Pullman’s ferocious heroine, one of the greatest ever written, a girl with quick wit and tooth-and-claw loyalty and a loose hand with the truth, voyages to the underworld. At first, on meeting the harpies who guard the realm of the dead, she lies – tells them what she thinks they want to hear. The harpies go for her, e‑bombing her and scraping at her skull with their talons. And so instead, she tells her own story: about pain, loss, hope and grubbiness, love and mistakes. The harpies listen. Lyra’s companion asks why they did not attack, this time: “‘Because it was true,’ said No‑Name. ‘Because she spoke the truth. Because it was nourishing. Because it was feeding us. Because we couldn’t help it. Because it was true.’”The harpies make a bargain: if each soul has paid heed to the world and has a story to tell of it, and they tell it truly, they will be led through the darkness to the other side. Rigorous attention, wakefulness to the world’s beauty, for Pullman, is what life demands of us. He has that in common with the philosopher Iris Murdoch, another writer I love, who decreed that attention was the foundation stone of love. We must learn, in Pullman’s universe, to watch the world with intense and generous care. We must learn to tell stories, his books say, whether it comes naturally or not – because it is the best and sometimes the only way we have to exchange truth.Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak“But the wild things cried, ‘Oh please don’t go – we’ll eat you up – we love you so!’“The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye.”There are as many interpretations of Where the Wild Things Are as there are people who have read it, and it means something very different when you are 30 from what it meant when you were three. I think it’s about the ferocity of love about how we devour each other, and are devoured.It’s also about, I think, the stark strangeness of the world. Max returns home to find his dinner “was still hot”. According to Sendak, his editors wanted him to cut or change that line, because it was impossible – or at least to edit it, to a more believable, “and it was still warm”. In an interview, he said: “‘Warm’ doesn’t burn your tongue. There is something dangerous in ‘hot’ … Hot is the trouble you can get into. But I won.” The world is, after all, rampantly strange. Children deserve books that are so too.One Dog and His Boy by Eva IbbotsonIn a world that prizes a pose of exhausted knowingness, children’s fiction allows itself the unsophisticated stance of awe. Eva Ibbotson escaped Vienna in 1934, after Hitler declared her mother’s writing illegal her work is full of an unabashed astonishment at the sheer fact of existence. In One Dog and His Boy, Hal, a child with everything he could wish for except love and care, releases five dogs from the cruel Easy Pets agency. He and his friend Pippa and the small sea of dogs go on the run to his grandparents’ home.On the way, each dog finds the place in which they can be themselves the Pekingese Li-Chee, who once guarded the temples of monks, lying at the feet of a girl in a foster home Francine the poodle, a natural comedian, performing in a travelling circus. It’s a story about finding your place and your people about not pausing or doubting until you find them.It’s also, like many of Ibbotson’s books, a shot across the bow at an increasingly consumerist world Hal’s parents shower goods on him, “a gift pack from Hamley’s and another from Harrods … but in the whole of the house there was nothing that was alive”. It’s a sharp attack on the tide of acquisition that threatens to swamp us to keep your neck above it, the book tells us, you must find something alive to love, be it beast or man, and hold on with both hands. Keep close, because the world will be cold, and frenetic and plastic, and only with each other will we make it.I love Peter Pan for being so entirely itself, not a diluted version of some other, adult thing. It offers up to us its own defiant logic, for Neverland is the place of the free experiment of the imagination. “Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingos flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.” And I love Peter himself: Peter is joy but he’s also a threat: he’s the id and the ego, the danger of being kidnapped by desire, he’s dark and capricious. He’s Pan.Barrie would argue that adults cannot go to Neverland. He writes: “On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles. We too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.” We adults, Barrie tells us, cannot return to that same reckless and freewheeling imagining. I disagree: I think the books summon up inside us the riotous, Panian parts of ourselves. I think, with Barrie’s aid, and with those who have come before and after him, we can sail back to those shores.There might be another lesson, too. Captain Hook, first name James, is an Old Etonian. Barrie writes: “He had been at a famous public school and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned … he still adhered in his walk to the school’s distinguished slouch.” Hook, in his dying moments, thinks of his childhood: of “the playing fields of long ago … or watching the wall-game from a famous wall”. In Barrie’s play version of the story, it is even more explicit: Hook’s last words are “Floreat Etona”, or “May Eton flourish”, the school’s motto.James Hook has been told he deserves everything, and when he does not get it, he attempts to bring destruction to Neverland, in the hope that from its chaos he shall rise. He has elaborate hair, “dressed in long curls”, and “he was never more sinister than when he was at his most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding”. Beware, the book tells us, pantomimic Old Etonians with unruly hair, who prize good form above truth, and who would seek to rule.• Why You Should Read Children’s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise is published by Bloomsbury.

In English, the book says that “we are constantly told that we are living in a new and frightening era of ‘post-truth’”, citing the annexation of the peninsula as an example.But in the Russian edition, Harari uses Trump to make this point: “According to estimates of the Washington Post newspaper, President Trump made more than 6,000 false public statements in the time after his inauguration.”Harari said that he had approved revisions of all his books for different audiences.“As a thinker and author, I do my best to reach erse audiences around the world. To enable my ideas and messages to easily reach people from various countries, over the years I have authorised and even initiated adaptations of all my books … The adaptations take into account different cultural, religious and political backgrounds. If I could, I would rewrite my books from scratch for each and every country, but I obviously cannot. When making adaptations, my guiding principle is to adapt the examples I use to explain my ideas, but never to change the ideas themselves,” he said.“In Russia, I was warned that due mainly to two examples I use, which sharply criticise the Russian invasion of Ukraine, censorship will not allow the publication and distribution of the book. I therefore faced a dilemma. Should I replace these few examples and publish the book in Russia – or should I change nothing, and publish nothing?”He said he chose to publish without the mention of the invasion, “because it seemed to me important that the book’s ideas should reach readers in Russia, especially as the book is still very critical of the Putin regime. The Russian translation warns readers about the dangers of dictatorship, corruption, homophobia and nationalist extremism. I don’t support Russian censorship – I have to deal with it.”But Harari added that while he had authorised some changes to the Russian translation, he had since learned of further, unauthorised revisions: “I was told that where I speak of the Russian conquest of Crimea, ‘conquest’ was changed to ‘re-attachment’, and that where I speak about my husband, it was changed to ‘partner’. If this is true, I strongly object to all such unauthorised alterations, and I will do my best to correct them.”Two years ago, the fantasy novelist VE Schwab found that one of her scenes, about the romantic relationship between two male characters, had been cut in Russia without her permission. Books featuring LGBT characters and storylines are regularly shrinkwrapped in Russia, following 2013’s ruling banning the spreading of “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” among minors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83109b778e92f94c1413278fba8964db0ff811d4/49_0_3261_1957/master/3261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc7ec91089dd64b6d99647e2d0a888d5","title":"the state of sports direct key points from results statement","story":"What does the extraordinary document lay bare about Mike Ashley’s business empire? Sports Direct’s annual results statement is an extraordinary document, peppered with shock financial revelations, scathing attacks on financial advisers, and stark warnings about the state of the high street. The idiosyncratic publication often descends into a rant by Mike Ashley, Sports Direct’s founder, controlling shareholder and chief executive. Here are some of the key points.The state of House of Fraser, bought out of administration in August, is laid bare. Ashley expresses regret about buying the business and warns that some of the chain’s problems are “nothing short of terminal in nature”. There is a warning that some of the group’s 54 stores may have to close, as Ashley praises landlords and local authorities for their efforts in trying to save branches. He adds: “We do believe there could be a bright future for House of Fraser” but then admits that his decision might have been different with hindsight. “If we had the gift of hindsight, we might have made a different decision in August 2018.”Ashley says Sports Direct has been in touch with auditors in anticipation of putting out a tender for its auditing work, currently carried out by Grant Thornton. However, the big four accounting firms do not appear likely to take on Sports Direct’s work soon. The statement says: Deloitte is conflicted because it does the company’s tax compliance and advisory work KPMG also believes it has conflicts of interest EY has “some reluctance” because it ran the administration of House of Fraser PwC has a “reluctance to engage” because of Sports Direct’s ownership structure.Ashley argues that financial advisers are not regulated properly, particularly those that operate in the field of company restructurings. Advisers should be “named and shamed” for implementing strategies that wipe out stakeholders. He then urges the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, to offer voluntary drug tests for the CEOs and CFOs of listed companies in case they are blackmailed and make bad decisions. “Having such undisclosed personal issues could lead to blackmail and force CEOs and CFOs to make decisions based on saving their own skin and potentially reducing shareholder value,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e35eb6f3113ee2b5143e7cacf1eea7e77566f666/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ff34dd32180508f34710735662deea0","title":"the dramatic transformation of britains canals photographs then and now","story":"See how Britain’s waterways have changed from industrial corridors to spaces for living and leisureby  Claire Burke and  Jo BlasonIn their industrial heyday, canals were bustling scenes of trade and commerce in Britain’s cities. Horse-drawn commercial boats carried goods along the waterways, and at one point the canal network carried nearly 40m tonnes of freight a year.Today, canals are being reclaimed as recreational spaces in densely populated cities – destinations for city dwellers to run, cycle and socialise.

One layer down and the city has become an entirely different place.I, like many, am using the canal as a quiet cut-through. It smells different down here there’s the dankness of the water, for sure, but there’s a wealth of green filtering the fumes from above. And the soundscape changes – song birds, the curious grunt of a bank of geese eyeing me and the dog warily, the lap of the water’s edge and the groan of metal sidings that are there to repair the bridge.Today the canal is a shortcut to another part of the city, but the canals also represent an escape for me. There’s a freedom to this space that feels unpoliced by normal city rules. When I am kayaking they become an adventure playground, a way to get to part of the city you can’t reach on foot. A place to meet fellows, human or otherwise, that you might not find elsewhere.The life down here is distinctly feral. There are men fishing, some for fish, some for metal. I’ve seen a man using a huge magnet on a thick line of rope to trawl the canal floor for treasure. There’s a trail of unwanted, rusting finds a child’s bike, a ner, bolt cutter, a pulley, rod bars and what looks like a rotting safe, a screwdriver, endless bike locks and a horse shoe. The archaeology of the canal in rusted orange.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.The horse shoe will no doubt date to the 18th century, when barges were towed by horses, ponies, donkeys and mules. The pulley from a warehouse loading bay and the bike locks symbolise something eternal about canals, they can hide a multitude of sins and secrets.The wildlife is feral, too, for however pretty and picturesque the towpath edge appears, fecund in dog roses and elder, thick with blackberries, buddleias and alders and waterlilies, it is also uncultivated, these wild things taking back the margins.Some are distinctly prosaic, dandelions and verges of selfheal, and others utterly unexpected – a bank of redcurrants dangling over the water, a thicket of figs full of fruit and an untamed apple orchard from thrown-away cores.This wild nature that sprouts from the cracks in the towpath and between the bricks in the bridges is in spite of us. For these are some of the most heavily polluted areas we’ve created in cities. At the height of their construction in the 18th century, canals ran like trunk roads, zigzagging across the country, following natural contours but serving the greatest catchment area for trade purposes. You can roughly date a canal to pre- or post-1750s by whether it is narrow and meandering or ramrod straight and wide.The more experienced and sophisticated engineers, such as Thomas Telford and William Jessop, constructed less scenic but more efficient canals that cut a straight line through, rather than around, obstacles using aqueducts, tunnels, high embankment and deep cuttings. They were shorn out of the industrial revolution’s landscape, giving them their nickname the Cut, as they were blasted through Triassic rock faces.Where today we might see banks of trees towering over the water, there would have been wall-to-wall buildings, the air thick with coal smoke and the water full of factory run-off. The bottom layer of silt in the canal is still full of heavy metal pollution from the period.For this reason, the water is both beguiling and disturbing. In the right light it is as pretty as can be, dazzling the red brick buildings around it, bouncing light into hidden corners, beckoning you forth. But stare too deeply into its depth and you glimpse its murky otherworld. For a long time in Birmingham, the canals were known as Dead Dog Ditch. They have unforgiving sides with deep ledges that are not meant for climbing out of, and there are countless tales of souls lost to the water.In modern history the canals have been claimed by runners and canoeists, by cyclists and strollers as valuable green spaces in cities. But we are merely gentrifiers of our own forgotten space: the hard work has been done by many things down in the dark recesses of the bottom of the canal. Duck mussels filtering through the heavily polluted industrial sludge, cleaning the water as they sup, waterlilies pumping oxygen down to the root layer so that small water creatures can creep, and carp, bream, rudd and roach can dart away from predators such as pike and eel. And with these come kingfishers, water voles and shrews, cormorants and the long, heavy swoop of grey herons.Nature has reclaimed her ground in our most polluted industrial areas, a testament to her powers over our neglect.For me the joy of visiting the canals is that they are not static spaces, they are vibrant in summer, reflective in autumn and frankly too cold for paddling in winter, but they are like old friends. I hope their feral nature is never taken for granted.The canal revolution series looks at what our changing waterways reveal about modern British cities.

But this is the future that could await usSince Monday, Britain has felt like a sun-bloated packet of supermarket pasta salad: sweating and smelly, abandoned at the bottom of a dog-waste bin, by turns greasy, hot, unpleasant, swollen and revolting. I have seen topless men resting beaded armpits on bus poles, teenagers dipping their feet in bright-green canals that are so choked with weed they seem hardly wet, parks turned to hay, parents wiping screaming and heat-exhausted children with flannels outside long queues for swimming pools, and car parks littered with ice-cube bags and fizzy drink cans. I have smelled other people’s arse cracks and seen carrier bags of used cat litter create a fiesta of bluebottles around our communal bins. I have left imprints on other people’s furniture.In the words of my mother – who lived through the 1976 heatwave with my newborn sister – “It’s pretty hard to deny climate change in this.” But, my friends, if this week has taught us anything at all – other than that strange, slippery, silvery feel of under-breast condensation – it is that Britain is not ready to live at 38C we are ill-prepared for our changing climate.According to a new piece of modelling by the global ecology research centre Crowther Labs, by 2050 London will have the climate of Barcelona. Sure, allow people to burn fossil fuels, farm intensively, drive and fly unnecessarily and waste natural resources like water and gas at the rate we are now and we’ll eventually have the climate of Barcelona. But we’ll have it with the culture of an NCP car park: crowded, threatening, poorly designed and smelling in every corner of someone else’s piss. When temperatures spike at 30C for a few surprising days a year, the UK could feel like a giant summer party. Benches are dragged on to pavements turned moist by recently melted chewing gum children play out into the golden glow of late evening, hitting balls against garage doors and screaming through the spray of a hose you’d go to a beer garden on the way home and drink something ludicrous because it was cold and you smelled of suntan lotion and felt you were on holiday you might text someone you shouldn’t you might soak your bed sheets as a result.But this week, as our children’s bedrooms still thrum away at 34C by midnight and our mosquito bites turn ankles into hot, stiff tree trunks of infection, people were not smiling. Tragedies occurred as people flocked to unsound bits of dockland, river and coast, desperate to find relief from the screaming sun above us. Parents, employees and trains simply dragged to a halt, like carthorses through liquid concrete. Emotions frayed, gardens withered, pets gently desiccated and children were sprinted from tree to tree by anxious parents trying to find entertainment in the shade for eight hours at a time. Suddenly, selling off all those shady public parks, local swimming pools, cool and quiet libraries, pieces of riverbank and tree-lined playgrounds didn’t seem like such a clever way for councils to claw back some money after years of vicious government cuts.Yesterday, during the hottest July day of my entire British life, I walked past a group of men in long-sleeved, full-length, high-vis worksuits, laying tarmac in the middle of a road junction. Machines pounded, the bitumen steamed, the sun raged down on their sweat-streaked faces. Each one looked, in his own way, like he was about to die. Rushing home, I half-filled my 20-month-old’s baby bath with cold water (to be later poured over our plants), in the middle of our front room, unable to go outside and unwilling to burn more precious resources and thereby increase the climate problem by buying a fan or – ye gads – an air conditioner. I thought of all those people in flats, like mine, with windows designed to open the width of a dildo. I thought of the nappies bulging in ripe bin bags like slow-roast casseroles. I thought of the cars occupied by single drivers, chugging poisonous blue fumes over fields and rivers because profit-crazed, micro-managing, outmoded bosses refused their request to work from home. I thought of all the ice-creams turning soft in corner shops.I have walked down enough fart-warm high streets, watched enough music festival fights and spent enough time on glaze-baked buses to know that Britain isn’t ready for 40C summers. Not in our homes, not in our workplaces, not even in our bodies. You may want to deny the climate emergency, you may want to hang on to the luxury and irresponsibility that denial allows. But my friends, you cannot deny the smell of a twice-cancelled commuter train service, with a blocked and swinging toilet, creeping past a fly-tipped ditch as a sweaty businessperson pulls a tuna mayonnaise sandwich from their heat-soft leather bag. This is the future that climate denial is heading us for. And I, for one, am not cool with that.• Nell Frizzell is a columnist and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54b978746540ec7d142ba6ab8dd285bb5436418/0_75_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34ee893abb1057af315eb32d181ef61c","title":"ottawa the ultimate seven day itinerary","story":"Where else can you cycle river paths, shop farmers’ markets, and watch city lights from a hot tub?

Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey.

I follow recipes to the letter, and buy the proper flour from a local Indian store, yet they always turn out like MDF. Am I missing a trick?Lizzie, Leeds“The key to chapati is the consistency of the dough,” says West-Country-based chef and food writer Romy Gill. “And if you are using true chapati flour, it’s vital the water ratio is correct, because it’s incredibly fine flour that goes very sticky very easily.”Once you’ve kneaded the dough, pop it in a bowl in the fridge for half an hour before you even think about starting to shape and cook chapatis, says Gill, whose debut book, Zaika: Vegan Recipes from India, is out in September. “The cold makes it go harder, which makes it easier to roll if you leave it at room temperature, it just gets wetter and stickier.”In other words, as with all bread-making, this is not the time for guesswork, even if you have years of knowhow. Sanjay Gour, co-owner with Nand Kishor of the much-acclaimed Dastaan in Epsom, Surrey (the pair previously ran the kitchens at the even more vaunted Gymkhana in London), goes a step further to stave off dry bread: “Put the dough in a lightly greased bowl, apply a very thin layer of oil to the top and cover with clingfilm – that will stop it from drying out and forming a skin.” Like Gill, Gour gives his dough at least a 30-minute chill, but adds that it’s advisable to leave the dough out to relax a little afterwards, so it’s more pliable and easier to ide into balls.Gour says another possible cause of Lizzie’s dry chapatis may be that she’s dusting them with too much flour when shaping. “Obviously, you need some flour, because this dough sticks to just about anything, but if you use even a bit more than you need, it will dry out and you’ll end up with dehydrated bread that’s not at all nice to eat.” If you’re in any doubt as to how much is too much, give the chapatis a good shake or two when rolling, just to be on the safe side.Gill adds that if you can’t get hold of chapati flour locally, you can make a pretty decent fist of it using plain or wholemeal instead. “I did a recipe for the Observer a few years ago that’s pretty foolproof.” But, she adds, a different flour requires a different treatment: “Rather than refrigerating it, keep the dough at room temperature, because it does the opposite of chapati flour dough.”Gill and Gour agree on another non-negotiable: brush one side of each cooked chapati with melted butter, then fold the bread over and cover with a tea towel. As Gill says, “This keeps them moist and soft, otherwise they’ll be like cardboard before the whole batch is cooked.”In India, many households make chapatis on a tava, or tawa – basically, a very flat, thin frying pan, often made of cheap steel or aluminium, designed for cooking all kinds of flatbreads, from chapatis to parathas and dosas (you can pick one up online for as little as a fiver) – but Gill says “a basic pancake pan works just fine”. Gour, however, prefers a flat griddle because, without the extreme heat of a professional hob, he reckons it’s better for getting the requisite char and blistering. “If Lizzie’s ever in Surrey,” he says, “tell her to pop over to Dastaan and we’ll give her a quick lesson.” I’m no Derren Brown, but somehow I foresee a fair few “Lizzies from Leeds” dialling Gour’s restaurant round about … now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57b53649caa17d1d43ad2fc6cbc2e8a2d283d046/0_33_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcc6fb582dfbec0b19c3102dae9615c","title":"gareth bale set to join china jiangsu suning on 1m a week contract real madrid football","story":"Gareth Bale is close to completing a move to a Chinese club Jiangsu Suning that will see the Welshman earn close to £1m per week, according to reports.Bale has been a linked with a move to China since last weekend and following Zinedine Zidane’s strongly worded comments regarding his future at Real Madrid.

Probably this has something to do with the way it is reflected back, most often through the wild frontier, the cranks’ rodeo, the Hobby Horse Derby of social media.More toxic still is the way the Premier League’s commercial success is so often described as simply this and nothing more, couched in tones of crowing economic triumphalism that reduces its devotees to numbers, eyeballs, units of desire.The power of football, the magic of football. Terms such as these have become corrupted by corporate inanity. We think of advert-people: clear-eyed, face-painted, transported by tyre-excitement or Visa-magic, a place where love means consumption, where unity is a roster of approved exclusive rights holders. Welcome to a world where all the people like all the football – and all the football is good. Little wonder it is hard to get a grip on this, to feel its human edges. But those edges are still there. Occasionally they appear in chastening, startling detail. This week I watched Redemption, the first episode of This Is Football, an Amazon Prime series that explores the magical power, the alchemy – and so on – of football and its supporters.So far, so familiar. The opening credits have Pep Guardiola sitting around looking damp-eyed and messianic and saying things like: “You must ... love the ball.” A sonorous voice says: “Football isn’t a game. It’s emotion!”, the kind of statement that makes you want to take the person who said it by the ear and tweak their nose and say really, really, is that actually true buckaroo?And then suddenly everything changes and Redemption takes us somewhere else entirely. The film follows the passionate familial love for Liverpool FC among a group of Rwandans, and the wider role football played in Rwanda’s recovery from the wounds of its terrifyingly recent genocide. It is an extraordinary, redemptive piece of film-making by James Erskine, who also directed One Night In Turin, and with whom I worked briefly on the film From The Ashes. There’s a beautiful opening shot, the camera panning over the dusty roads and jerry-built houses of Kigali, the Rwandan capital, set to the irresistibly cheese-laden, oddly intimate tones of You’ll Never Walk Alone.A group of men in red shirts are singing “We are Liverpool” gently as they walk through the suburbs. This is the Rwanda Reds, a club for men and women who love Liverpool with a fervour that is initially quite startling. As darkness falls they start to hug and dance in front of the big screen, some crying and laughing at the same time. One man mentions he named his son after a noted local hero. His son is called “Ian Rush”.There are two main characters. There’s Joe, a ranger in the national park. We see him punching the air in the middle of the plains as Mo Salah scores a goal over the crackly radio in his Toyota pick-up. Joe sighs and says: “When Liverpool score … I feel my daddy. He is always watching, supporting Liverpool.” Then there’s Claude-Romeo, a little younger and about to get married, who says: “Some of us have lost our brothers and sisters. So the Liverpool shirt to me is a family.” These might sound like cliches anywhere else, the kind of thing Nero-era Sepp Blatter used to gabble about. But this isn’t anywhere else.A bit later we discover that Joe’s daddy, who he thinks about when Liverpool score and who loved Kenny Dalglish, was brutally murdered near the family home. Claude-Romeo doesn’t have any bothers and sisters because, like so many other Rwandans, they were murdered during those hundred days in 1994 when a million Tutsis were slaughtered by their neighbours and countrymen.The Belgians brought football to Rwanda in the 19th century. They also brought ethnic ision, a fault-line of engineered social tension that would eventually come to a horrendous end. Football has been at the heart of Rwanda’s efforts to recover from this trauma. Again, this is not a platitude. In the aftermath the game sprung up on every patch of land. Orphans, displaced people and half empty villages began to play together. Football became therapy, but also social glue. During the genocide Rwandan women suffered terrible abuse. A national programme of women’s football was introduced as a way of trying to encourage young women to “be active, not taken over by the past”.Eventually thousands of suspected mass murderers were released from the overcrowded prisons. They began to play football matches against the survivors. A kind of fraternity emerged. Forgiveness became possible. The famous African Cup Of Nations victory against Ghana in 2003 led to scenes of wild shared joy: “We believed then that anything was possible.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsThe film’s absolute kick in the guts comes right at the end when suddenly Joe and Claude-Romeo are in Liverpool going to Anfield, talking about whether Roberto Firmino is going to start. Outside the ground they keep on grinning and hugging and laughing. There’s Joe gazing up at the Kenny Dalglish stand. You know who he’s thinking about. Finally they see the pitch and Joe has to stop and hold his head and take a breath, and by this stage, no I’m not crying, you are, I’m just looking out of the window and being quiet for a bit.It really is worth a watch. And please don’t tell me about Starbucks’s sponsorship, or indeed about the concerns over Rwanda’s current regime, which have their place too. It’s just that Redemption isn’t about these things. It’s about the actual power, the actual magic of this global sport something that has been owned and styled by the corporate arm but which has within it an unmapped, unmonetised sense of hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f47bb4b44029ff853b38ba7b07a25deed4f28af/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c0a185bcdc438aa8e7740278f09c5e","title":"lets move to ceredigion","story":"There are few places in better spirits than this remote and ancient placeWhat’s going for it?

The nearby coast has everything from rugged cliffs and sandy beaches to secret coves – not to mention dolphin sightings.

It is scheduled to run from 16-18 August.The anniversary event has been spiralling out of control after the original ticket release was delayed, headliners including the Black Keys pulled out, and its financial backers, Dentsu Aegis, walked away, claiming the right to cancel the event entirely.Organizers, who include Woodstock 69’s original promoter, Michael Lang, initially decided that the original site was too small to hold enough people. They then lost the right to hold it at a larger venue in Watkins Glen, New York, after failing to make a payment. Less than a month ago, a third site at Vernon Downs in New York fell through when local officials said safety plans were “worthless”.Calvin Ball, an executive at Maryland’s Howard county, said Merriweather Post Pavilion “jumped at the chance” to save this festival and “bring a piece of American history to our community this summer”.“It felt like such a natural fit to host a historic festival on our storied stage,” he wrote to organizers in a letter obtained by Bloomberg.But challenges remain. It is not clear whether the original lineup, which included Jay-Z, Miley Cyrus and Halsey, are obliged to perform if the event is held so far away. A source told the Associated Press that Jay-Z, who was due to close the festival, had indeed pulled out.According to Variety, touring agents are uniting against playing the new venue and demanding that artists be released from their contracts.“Most can’t play Maryland and don’t want to be involved in an event that is not properly conceived and developed,” says one industry insider. “We took it as far down the road as we could. The clock just ran out.”The event’s purpose has shifted: it is no longer being promoted as a commercial festival but as a fundraiser for groups promoting voter turnout and the climate crisis. Given the new venue’s proximity to the capital, the name has changed to “Woodstock 50 Washington”.According to current plans, entry prices will go on sale at $129 to $595 for a one-day pass and it’s being marketed to 800,000 people across Washington DC, Maryland and northern Virginia. The original event was characterized by chaos and astonishing performances by Sly and the Family Stone, Janis Joplin, the Who and Jimi Hendrix.Woodstock 50 Washington will not be the only commemorative event. The original site in Bethel, New York, is also holding a weekend of concerts featuring shows by Santana, Ringo Starr and John Fogerty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd48d6cace4b80c1b4ceac048b92303e2c38b34f/0_0_3500_2331/master/3500.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63b366859f0c2feeb8f3cee6fb44fd51 660w","title":"dominic cummings was doorman at europes worst nightclub","story":"Uncle of Boris Johnson’s strategist owned ‘infamously bad’ Klute in DurhamWhile the role that Boris Johnson’s new adviser Dominic Cummings played in the Vote Leave campaign is well-established, his links to another disruptive force in British public life are less well known.Klute nightclub in Durham, with its sticky floors, strong drinks and unapologetically cheesy music, boasts of having been a favourite of the city’s students for more than 40 years.The 400-capacity club was apparently awarded the title of second worst nightclub in Europe by FHM magazine, before the venue in first place burned down, leaving Klute to take the top spot by default.The club was owned by Cummings’ uncle Phil and in his youth the political adviser reportedly helped him to run it. While the business was bought by Tokyo Industries in 2013, Cummings is still listed as the only director of a dormant company called Klute Limited.The announcement on Wednesday that Cummings – the former head of the Vote Leave campaign – would be a senior adviser to Boris Johnson was seen as hugely controversial. The former aide to Michael Gove as education secretary was found in contempt of parliament in March for failing to appear before MPs investigating the proliferation of false news stories during the EU referendum campaign.Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended the fee-paying Durham school, before going on to study at the University of Oxford.In January, the Sunday Express reported that Cummings had worked as a doorman at Klute at weekends. “He might not have looked like a doorman,” a former colleague told the paper. “But he had a way with him that suggested it wasn’t worth taking him on.”One fellow Eurosceptic campaigner told the  about a particularly drunken night there with Cummings in 2005. “We went there after dinner and we were completely battered by the time we got to Klute. It’s a long time ago and I was very drunk, but I’m pretty sure we were taken into some sort of VIP area,” he said.“Everyone had been going on at me beforehand about how terrible it was. It was infamously bad, and even Dom was making jokes about it, but I got there and thought: ‘This is quite nice’.”He remembers drinking a range of cocktails including “cheeky vimtos” – usually made from port and the alcopop WKD Blue. “People were dressed up for a good night out in the way people in London don’t really,” he said. “It was just a very normal, fun night out.”In a comment thread on the Student Room website from 2009, one student described Klute as “a cheese-infested hellhole”. Another from 2005 described it as “sweaty, a bit gross, moody bouncers”, adding more cheerfully: “double and mixer £2”.These days the club seems to have embraced its down-at-heel image, adopting the tagline: “Wipe your feet on the way out.”After visiting the club in 2014, the Vice journalist Jonny Chadwick concluded that it was “the best example of the worst kind of club night”.“This sweatbox of unpleasant humans, terrible music and unbearable odours probably deserves its place at the top of the podium,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6de6a7c4d3b54a54f94c0f77c83d03b7d4cf8a6e/0_176_2045_1227/master/2045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67654da8095babd5b252b5311dcc4532","title":"priti patel accused of breaching ministerial code for second time","story":"Home secretary took up £1,000 an hour advisory role before getting watchdog’s approvalThe new home secretary, Priti Patel, is facing allegations of breaching the ministerial code for the second time in her parliamentary career for accepting a lucrative position with a global communications firm before receiving the all-clear from an anti-corruption watchdog.Patel has been working for Viasat, a California-based company with a UK base in Farnborough, for the past three months as a strategic adviser on a salary of £5,000 a month for five hours’ work – or £1,000 an hour.The ministerial code states former ministers must seek guidance from the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba) on taking up any business appointments within two years of leaving the role – and must not take up the position until advice has been received.Patel did not approach Acoba to seek advice on the Viasat appointment until June 2019 – a month after she had started the role, in which she was advising on unspecified matters relating to India. She did not receive any guidance from the committee until earlier this month, by which time she had already earned £10,000.Patel has been approached for comment by the .The Essex MP was forced to resign from the cabinet in November 2017 as international development secretary when she was accused of breaching the ministerial code over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. Patel conceded in her resignation letter that her actions fell below standards of transparency and openness required.Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, has written to the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, calling for an investigation into whether Patel has broken the ministerial code, and has called for her dismissal if this is found to be the case. Johnson himself has breached the code in the past when he resumed writing for the  after resigning as foreign secretary he failed to declare the role with Acoba.Trickett said: “Very few people will be surprised that Boris Johnson’s cabinet is embroiled in scandal less than 48 hours after being appointed, yet it is still deeply worrying.“It is an early sign that Johnson’s hard-right government will have little regard for the standards expected of ministers, by the ministerial code and by the public.“When she resigned in 2017, Patel spoke of her failure to uphold the necessary ‘standards of transparency and openness’. It appears she has done so again.“Clearly Patel does not think the rules apply to her, and the same could be said of many others in Johnson’s cabinet. Johnson must immediately sanction an investigation to confirm whether Patel has yet again broken the code, and reassure the public that his government will not tolerate those that disregard it so lightly.“I have written to the prime minister to ensure that this course of action is taken immediately.”Acoba approved the appointment but with strict conditions. The committee said given her seniority and profile as a secretary of state there was a risk that it could be perceived Patel’s contacts “might assist Viasat unfairly”.As a result, Acoba said Patel could take up the appointment but should not draw on any privileged information available from her time as international development secretary, should not lobby the UK government on behalf of Viasat and should not provide provide advice on any contracts with the UK government.Viasat provides products and services to the Ministry of Defence. It also works with the UK Space Agency, an executive agency sponsored by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.Section 7.25 of the code states that ministers “must … seek advice from the independent advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba) about any appointments or employment they wish to take up within two years of leaving office.”This section of the code also states that “former ministers must ensure that no new appointments are announced, or taken up, before the committee has been able to provide its advice”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c886251fdf0bda7f3d6e3333ea90e694e15e0137/0_63_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52bc90949b9370b2cd6af5583ed9b1f9","title":"the comma touch jacob rees mogg sends language rules to staff","story":"Commons leader reportedly wants his team to use imperial measurements and avoid saying ‘very’A list of rules has been sent to Jacob Rees-Mogg’s staff asking them to stop using words such as “hopefully” and demanding that they use only imperial measurements and give all non-titled males the suffix Esq.Aides to the new leader of the House of Commons sent out the list shortly after Rees-Mogg’s appointment to the role by the new prime minister on Wednesday night.Among the words and phrases considered unacceptable were: “very”, “due to” and “ongoing”, as well as “equal”, “yourself” and “unacceptable”.

When standing for the Conservatives for the Central Fife seat in 1997, he took his nanny and his mother’s Mercedes out canvassing.Rees-Mogg has also used his position of influence to argue against abortion, even in cases of rape, and same-sex marriage.He has been one of the most prominent backers of a hard Brexit and, last year, it was revealed that a City firm he co-founded had set up an investment fund in Ireland and was warning prospective clients about the financial dangers of a hard Brexit.Following his appointment by Johnson this week, he is responsible for organising government business in the Commons.The Commons leader’s office would not comment on the leaked document."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/276f442ef211d2dcafe06529728fa5fac21ed8c9/0_220_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33b5cdea1ecaa8a94b291fbdefd19af7","title":"share your experiences of netball","story":"Following New Zealand winning the Women’s Netball World Cup, we would like to hear your stories of playing the sportThe world of women and sport is rapidly changing.

So when I did get a start I was keen to start putting the foot down and take the opportunity because that doesn’t come along very often. It was nice to be able to cash in.”The match was all-but decided in the first three overs of England’s reply: the home side sinking to 12 for three as the openers, Danni Wyatt and Amy Jones, departed without scoring, looking to slog, while Tammy Beaumont then toed a catch to Alyssa Healy behind the stumps.A brave effort from the No 6, Lauren Winfield, selected for the first time this series, was followed by a 12-ball 25-run cameo from Laura Marsh both came too late to make much difference to a day that had been all about Lanning.This was supposed to have been England’s prime opportunity to turn the series on its head: on 14 previous occasions, they had never lost a match here where the crowds are so partisan and raucous that it has earned the moniker “Fortress Chelmsford”. This time the sell-out crowd sounded anything but, sinking into themselves as they searched in vain for something to cheer.Kate Cross’s first over, with Healy skying the fifth ball of the innings to Nat Sciver at midwicket, was as good as it got for the home crowd. From there, with Lanning entering the fray, it was all systems go: Anya Shrubsole hit out of the attack as her first over went for 16 runs, while the early switch to spin failed to stem the flow – Sophie Ecclestone punished for nearly 11 an over.Along the way Lanning was ably supported by Beth Mooney, who hit a 28-ball half-century, and Ash Gardner, who smashed the biggest six of the innings off a disgruntled Shrubsole.Some have questioned whether undergoing major shoulder surgery 18 months ago has stymied Lanning’s international dominance. This performance showed that she is back with a vengeance, the Australian captain smashing seven sixes with such ease that one feels her shoulder surgeon should use the videotape of this innings to advertise his services to future clients.Lanning’s half-century took 24 balls to acquire: 27 balls later came the three-figure milestone, brought up in style with yet another six smashed over deep square-leg.As any statistician will tell you, numbers have to be contextualised. Lanning’s previous T20 century had been against Ireland, ranked 10th: perhaps the most astonishing thing about Friday’s display was that it was against a side who, after reaching the final of the World T20 eight months ago, can lay claim to being the second-best T20 team in the world. They did not look it: even Wyatt, England’s best fielder, was gifting boundaries in the deep, while Beaumont made the fatal error of dropping Lanning at point, a mistake that cost 48 runs.“We haven’t played anywhere near our potential,” Heather Knight, the England captain, said. “The girls are disappointed, it’s been a tricky few weeks for us – we’ve lost a bit of belief and confidence.”“We’ve got to get back to the way we know we can play. When we’re at our best we’re competitive, we’re happy, we’re smiley, we’re buzzing, all that sort of thing, so it’s about getting back to our roots as a team that have served us well.”Before Friday night, it would have been possible to argue that this Ashes series – bar one crazy afternoon at Canterbury – has been evenly matched: not any more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa31eef13cfaf7638af71cd2fd1300f2e05efdfe/167_119_5401_3241/master/5401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a906a915602013d47e8db69321b9c337","title":"joe root substandard lords pitch england ireland test","story":"England’s bowlers will not thank Joe Root for it but their captain was highly critical of the Lord’s pitch after his side’s 143-run victory against Ireland. “I don’t like saying this but the wicket was substandard for a Test match,” Root said after Ireland were bowled out for 38. “It wasn’t even close to being a fair contest between bat and ball throughout the whole game.”He admitted his team “weren’t at our best by any stretch” but, in what came across as a pretty clear dig at the Lord’s groundsman, Karl McDermott, Root said: “When you are getting scores like that, that tells a story in itself.”McDermott, who took over the job only last December, has just over a fortnight to get his surface ready for the second Ashes Test. Root said he hoped the pitch would be better than this one. “We’ll have to wait and see if it is similar,” he said. “I don’t think it will be.”If it is, England “will have to make sure we try to exploit it the best we can, to find a method to cope and score runs. The challenge will be the same for Australia as it was for us and Ireland this week. It will make for entertaining cricket if that’s the case.”The blunt truth is that it was not only the pitch that was substandard but the batting too, since both teams were bowled out in the space of a single session. Root insisted “from a batting point of view, it’s hard to take too much out of it on a surface like that” and that “it’s hard for anyone to read too much into this in very extreme conditions”.He did admit “we have got to be more precise about how we want to defend” and that he was personally responsible for “opening the door for Ireland” in the second innings, when he “stupidly” ran out Joe Denly.Lurking in the background behind all this talk about the pitch, there is a suggestion that Root and the other players who turned out for England in the World Cup are exhausted. Root did not deny he was feeling “knackered” and said: “It’s been 10 weeks of hard cricket, of high emotion, of ups and downs. It does take a lot out of you.”He did not want to make an excuse of it. “You have to suck it up and get on with it. It’s not been perfect but we’ve dealt with it pretty well. It’s hard to look too much into performances on there but mentally coping with it I think we’ve done all right.“We’ve never been in a position where we’ve won a World Cup, so for half the side to be part of that and then very quickly adjust to Test cricket is unusual. You’ve never been in that position before, so it’s hard to know how you’re going to cope.”Personally he had turned up at Lord’s “feeling extremely excited for the Test summer” and now its preface was over he felt “pleased we managed to find a way to win this game. There’s been so many different pressures and challenges thrown at us”.There have but it is all about to get that much more pressured and that much more challenging again. The hard part is only just starting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b134bcd89af817a54b5c03d025a2912ce3396bf3/21_195_2590_1554/master/2590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=228b118bc3d366a645ce36b1c157e2c0","title":"sebastian vettel ferrari future german grand prix","story":"Sebastian Vettel, despite everything, is still smiling. The equanimity with which he faces his shortcomings this season and the realisation his Ferrari team cannot challenge Mercedes for the Formula One title, says much for his character.Yet competing in the 11 remaining races in a car with which he is struggling weighs heavy and that smile must be beginning to fade. Little wonder that debate in the paddock before his home race at the German Grand Prix on Sunday revolves around whether he will retire at the end of the season.At 32, Vettel has four titles, all for Red Bull between 2010 and 2013. He joined Ferrari in 2015 with the intent of emulating Michael Schumacher, building the team around him and returning their first drivers’ championship since 2007. What followed has been a rollercoaster of optimism and shattered hopes that could easily break a driver. Vettel insists he will see out his final season with Ferrari next year before deciding on his future.This season is already gone, with Vettel 100 points behind Lewis Hamilton, and Mercedes holding a distinct advantage. Once again the hope of a Ferrari challenge has disappeared, dispiritingly almost from the opening race. The Scuderia, who had backed Vettel as their No 1 driver from the off, appear to have given the German a car that simply does not suit him.In the 2015 and 2016 seasons, Ferrari were blown away by the dominant Mercedes. By 2017 they were in a position to mount a challenge and last year were even stronger, with the superior car for much of the season. Errors by driver and team proved costly and their hopes slipped away.Last year Vettel went off at Hockenheim while leading in the rain, the low point of a season peppered with mistakes. This year he spun while in competition with Hamilton in Bahrain, and in Canada went off when under pressure from the British driver. At the last race at Silverstone, his misjudgment in crashing into Max Verstappen was as public and as egregious an error as he has made since Spa 2010 when he lost control at the Bus Stop and hit Jenson Button.He has admitted he is more than aware of his failings. “I always put myself under pressure, so I can’t be happy if things go wrong,” he said. “The pressure I put on myself after that is bigger than any external factors. For me it’s the most honest and straightforward way to deal with it myself, because I know what I’ve done wrong and what I’ve done right.”The incident at the British Grand Prix was seen as an error indicative of a driver struggling for confidence. Alain Prost singled it out. “The collision at Silverstone happened due to a lack of judgment. We clearly see that he is not in top form,” he said. “It is due to a lack of sufficient concentration, motivation or judgment.”At Hockenheim Vettel has insisted it is a privilege not a burden to race for Ferrari. However Johnny Herbert, who raced alongside Michael Schumacher at Benetton in 1995, is convinced that representing the Scuderia lies heavy on Vettel. “Sebastian still has to carry Ferrari on this shoulders,” he said. “The pressure of Italy, of the team, of the media. In the last couple of years they haven’t taken that pressure off. That massive weight hasn’t allowed him to breathe. Ferrari haven’t got that balance right, a driver needs that.”But what seems equally as important as where Vettel is mentally is what he is feeling through the seat of his pants. His titles were won during the blown diffuser period of 2010-2011 and then when it was banned, Red Bull maintained their advantage by clever channelling of exhaust gasses in 2012-2013. The period was one where downforce was dominant and Vettel was its master.He likes to arrive fast into the corner, brake late and turn-in aggressively, before getting back on the power. The Red Bull suited this to perfection, he had the front end he needed for corner entry and the confidence that the grip would be there when he hit the throttle on exit.When the Red Bull struggled with rear stability early in one season, Vettel’s teammate Mark Webber had an edge. As the team solved the problem, the car came to Vettel, as did the title. In 2014 when all exhaust blowing was removed Vettel looked uncomfortable, did not win a race and was beaten by his inexperienced teammate Daniel Ricciardo.This season Ferrari will have endeavoured to build a car to suit Vettel, instead they have delivered what appears to be the opposite, a car with inherent understeer. Worse still he has struggled to adapt to it. Since the Canadian GP he has been outqualified and outperformed by his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc in every race. Leclerc seems more adept at being able to hustle the car through the corners.“If I don’t feel what I need it’s a bit tricky,” Vettel said of his car in 2018 at Melbourne. It is a view with which Herbert concurs. “The car is not what he wants,” he said. “It’s not delivering what he needs to feel through the tips of his fingers and his shoulders and when you don’t have that feeling you are going to struggle and then the mental side comes in.”The Ferrari team principal, Mattia Binotto, has held up his hands in admitting the car is not where it should be but publicly Vettel remains committed to his task. This year he married his childhood sweetheart with whom he has two children and while he enjoys a life away from F1 at Hockenheim he reiterated his intent to see out his time with Ferrari. Having put four years in already and still smiling, Vettel knows there is still a job to be done with the team.“He went to Ferrari to try to win a championship, he has not achieved that,” Herbert said. “I would be so surprised if he walked away having not achieved that. I would be shocked if he did that. The opportunity is still there. He has not finished the job he went there to do.”At their home race Mercedes are running a white livery to celebrate 125 years since what is considered the first race held in 1894 from Paris to Rouen. Ferrari however had the edge in Friday’s first practice session. Vettel was quickest with Leclerc second in front of Hamilton and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. The Ferrari teammates traded places in the afternoon session with Leclerc holding a 0.124sec advantage. Hamilton again had to settle for third, 0.146sec off Leclerc’s pace. Mercedes, struggling in the fierce temperatures as they had in Austria, will be hoping for cooler weather."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e06b5d65732b3569f146c26711428f6e9ee2efb3/189_25_3173_1905/master/3173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e31c334b6db33b9704d94fe4a8d0eaf3","title":"talking horses enable can outclass rivals king george queen elizabeth stakes horse racing tips","story":"Enable arguably faced a stiffer task in the Eclipse but she coped brilliantly and should be in even better shapeThis year’s King George VI \u0026amp Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot is deep on quality but the outcome may still be predictable. Enable (3.40) arguably faced a stiffer task last time in the Eclipse at Sandown, when short of peak fitness and tackling an unfamiliar distance, but she coped brilliantly and ought to be in even better shape now.Crystal Ocean is very likeable but he was beaten at level weights by Poet’s Word in this race last year. Can he now give Enable 3lb and be the first to beat her since April 2017? It seems doubtful.A superior Derby winner is hard to beat in the King George, being helped by the weight-for-age scale, but Anthony Van Dyck could not be called superior. Four rivals finished within a length of him at Epsom and he needs the cheekpieces, which have been fitted this time, to make a difference.2.05 York Danny Tudhope is an interesting booking for Medahim and perhaps a big run is expected from Ivan Furtado’s gelding on his third outing of the year. He has come back down to the mark from which he won at Glorious Goodwood last year and this is his first chance below Class Two since then.2.25 Ascot It bodes well for Wings Of Time’s chance at this wide track that he was happy ploughing a lone furrow at Newmarket last time. He held on by only a neck in that handicap debut but is clearly going the right way.2.40 York It has been a long time since Savalas last got his head in front, in May last year, but he is on his lowest rating since and the refitting of cheekpieces seemed to help him last time. He was a fair fourth at the Dante meeting here and has dropped another 6lb since. Jamie Spencer is an encouraging booking.3.00 Ascot It is a surprise to be getting 20-1 about a horse having as good a year as Kaeso, who won a decent pot at Chester in May and scored again at Doncaster last weekend. From the in-form Nigel Tinkler yard, he was beaten half a length in the Victoria Cup over this course and distance and that form looks strong, the winner having followed up in the Wokingham.3.15 York Excuses could be made for Bangkok’s two defeats this year, so he is interesting, as the only three-year-old in this York Stakes. But Regal Reality looks the class act, in light of his Brigadier Gerard Stakes win and Eclipse third.

Sometimes the script is almost too rich – there’s so much information to take in – but it’s an undeniably beautiful thing, packed with authentic dialogue and stunning flashes of insight.There’s passionate political and personal debate as the men discuss Mugabe, Mandela, fallen leaders and absent fathers. Perhaps the most surprising aspect is just how tender this all-male play feels. Sure, there’s posturing and showboating, especially when Demmy Ladipo’s “bad boy” is showing off to the lads. But there are so many gentle moments in here too: a hard-up old man is given a free haircut a barber offers a young dad some beautiful advice (“Listen to your child – he will teach you the right language”) and an anxious young actor finds a place to relax and confess his fears.It’s not just about the dialogue, either. There are the music and movement, overseen by Elander Moore, which infuse the scene-changes with energy and purpose. There are also the collective sighs, groans and cheers, as the men talk, listen and, of course, watch football.

They are tasked with grading the responses on a variety of factors, including whether the activation of the voice assistant was deliberate or accidental, whether the query was something Siri could be expected to help with and whether Siri’s response was appropriate.Apple says the data “is used to help Siri and dictation … understand you better and recognise what you say”.But the company does not explicitly state that that work is undertaken by humans who listen to the pseudonymised recordings.A whistleblower working for the firm, who asked to remain anonymous due to fears over their job, expressed concerns about this lack of disclosure, particularly given the frequency with which accidental activations pick up extremely sensitive personal information.Siri can be accidentally activated when it mistakenly hears its “wake word”, the phrase “hey Siri”. Those mistakes can be understandable – a BBC interview about Syria was interrupted by the assistant last year – or less so. “The sound of a zip, Siri often hears as a trigger,” the contractor said. The service can also be activated in other ways. For instance, if an Apple Watch detects it has been raised and then hears speech, Siri is automatically activated.The whistleblower said: “There have been countless instances of recordings featuring private discussions between doctors and patients, business deals, seemingly criminal dealings, sexual encounters and so on. These recordings are accompanied by user data showing location, contact details, and app data.”That accompanying information may be used to verify whether a request was successfully dealt with. In its privacy documents, Apple says the Siri data “is not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services”. There is no specific name or identifier attached to a record and no inidual recording can be easily linked to other recordings.Accidental activations led to the receipt of the most sensitive data that was sent to Apple. Although Siri is included on most Apple devices, the contractor highlighted the Apple Watch and the company’s HomePod smart speaker as the most frequent sources of mistaken recordings. “The regularity of accidental triggers on the watch is incredibly high,” they said. “The watch can record some snippets that will be 30 seconds – not that long but you can gather a good idea of what’s going on.”Sometimes, “you can definitely hear a doctor and patient, talking about the medical history of the patient. Or you’d hear someone, maybe with car engine background noise – you can’t say definitely, but it’s a drug deal … you can definitely hear it happening. And you’d hear, like, people engaging in sexual acts that are accidentally recorded on the pod or the watch.”The contractor said staff were encouraged to report accidental activations “but only as a technical problem”, with no specific procedures to deal with sensitive recordings. “We’re encouraged to hit targets, and get through work as fast as possible. The only function for reporting what you’re listening to seems to be for technical problems. There’s nothing about reporting the content.”As well as the discomfort they felt listening to such private information, the contractor said they were motivated to go public about their job because of their fears that such information could be misused. “There’s not much vetting of who works there, and the amount of data that we’re free to look through seems quite broad. It wouldn’t be difficult to identify the person that you’re listening to, especially with accidental triggers – addresses, names and so on.The contractor argued Apple should reveal to users this human oversight exists – and, specifically, stop publishing some of its jokier responses to Siri queries. Ask the personal assistant “are you always listening”, for instance, and it will respond with: “I only listen when you’re talking to me.”That is patently false,, the contractor said. They argued that accidental triggers are too regular for such a lighthearted response.Apple is not alone in employing human oversight of its automatic voice assistants. In April, Amazon was revealed to employ staff to listen to some Alexa recordings, and earlier this month, Google workers were found to be doing the same with Google Assistant.The company values its reputation for user privacy highly, regularly wielding it as a competitive advantage against Google and Amazon. In January, it bought a billboard at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas announcing that “what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/201ace3264e351852ddc37b2caf8d221e226139c/0_183_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f854a9ea52e0562728cd544bf21105b3","title":"whisky business how do you drink yours","story":"For too long a snobbery has lingered over how best to consume whisky. Can there really be a right – or wrong – way to enjoy your favourite malt?It can often seem as if there are only two schools of thought when it comes to how you should enjoy your whisky. Some treat the drink with an almost austere reverence, insisting that it should only be taken neat or with just a touch of water – maybe, at a pinch, with an ice cube or two. Others, which in reality means most people who enjoy a tipple every now and then, are happy to mix it to taste with whatever works for them, use it as a base for a cocktail, or simply sip it from a mighty tumbler towering with ice.But is there a right way to drink whisky? It might be that you can do whatever you want with the house blend down at your local pub, but what about something more refined – in other words, what about a single malt?For the uninitiated, the distinction between a blend and a single malt is a fairly easy one to mark out. A scotch blend is simply a mixture of grain and malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. A single malt, on the other hand, is nothing more and nothing less than a whisky from a single distillery, bottled and sold as a whisky from a single distillery.But, of course, things are always a little more complicated than that. Blends are sometimes thought to be inferior to their single malt cousins, and while this is by no means a settled question, it is true that they don’t quite inspire the same scholarly devotion as single malts. So, while plenty of whisky purists may have no problem with you topping up an inexpensive blend with a yard of Coke, they’re likely to take a less charitable view of you doing the same with their favourite malt.Luckily, there is an answer to all of this.“It really just depends on what you’re looking for,” says Kirstie McCallum, senior blender at Distell International, which owns and produces Tobermory. “For me there’s a real difference between wanting to sit there and appreciate a whisky for all its flavours and complexity, and just actually wanting to sit there and enjoy a drink with friends.“If I want to appreciate all the flavours in a whisky and appreciate that maturation and the work that’s gone into it I love it with just a wee touch of water to open it up,” she says. “Then just sip it, let it rest in your mouth a bit so that you get a proper chance to take in all of the flavours. At the same time, if you’re just sitting around having a drink with your friends, do whatever you want with it.”McCallum’s refreshingly unpretentious take is rooted in her view that whisky – and that includes single malts – is on the whole a social, relaxed drink. That means there is plenty of room at the table both for those who want to contemplate their whisky – either neat or, as she prefers it, with a touch of water – and those who want to let their hair down a bit more.“I think for too long whisky has been seen as kind of standoffish,” she says. “There’s always been this view of whisky that it’s maybe a bit like how people see wine – they worry about not knowing what to ask for or about getting it wrong somehow. But whisky shouldn’t be like that at all, because it’s a drink for everybody.“We make the whisky for people to drink it, and whatever you like adding to it, as long as you enjoy it that’s how you should drink it,” says McCallum. “The great thing is that whisky is just such a versatile drink. You can do cocktails with whisky, you can do long drinks, or you can have a nice single malt with water.”With that in mind, McCallum suggests a number of tantalising options for enjoying Tobermory 12 Year Old. “I think with Tobermory being such a citrusy, caramelly, kind of sweet whisky, it mixes well with something that’s nice and light and fresh,” she says.“It works really well as a long mixed drink with lots of ice. I’d recommend trying it that way with either ginger ale or some fresh apple juice,” she says.On the cocktail front, McCallum says that the citrus and caramel notes of Tobermory 12 Year Old are particularly complemented by berry flavours – so a Scotch bramble, or perhaps a malt old fashioned with a blueberry garnish, could be well worth trying.“For me, whisky is a very personal drink,” she says. “I drink my whisky and it’s about memories of being places and being with friends – it’s not about ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’. In the end, it’s about enjoying it on your own terms – do whatever you want with it.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd7b007fed555bdffd47f8e7b9797506fb52d7c/0_63_4804_2883/master/4804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1dc19f2a5b8aa7caf930c9cee6c0d29","title":"house democrats mueller grand jury evidence impeachment","story":"Lawmakers say they need evidence to determine impeachment proceedings as they file lawsuit to compel testimony from McGahnThe Democratic-led US House judiciary committee is filing an application to seek access to grand jury evidence from the Mueller investigation, which lawmakers say they need to determine whether to begin impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump.A second pending legal move by Democrats, a federal lawsuit to compel testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn about the Republican president’s efforts to impede the Mueller investigation, is expected early next week.The grand jury evidence, which is protected from outside scrutiny by federal law, was compiled by former special counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign’s links with Moscow.The House judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, told a news conference that since justice department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president, the House of Representatives was the only institution of government capable of holding Trump accountable for actions outlined in the Mueller report.“The House must have access to all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full … powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity: recommendation of articles of impeachment,” Nadler said, reading from the court petition.He also said Mueller’s grand jury information “is critically important for our ability to examine witnesses, including former White House counsel Don McGahn, and to investigate the president’s misconduct”.The committee’s Democrats, who flanked Nadler at the news conference, said the pending court petition was a new step toward impeachment and described their ongoing obstruction of justice investigation against Trump as an “impeachment investigation”, though the panel has not officially launched an impeachment inquiry.Many reports have indicated that Nadler has privately voiced support for launching an impeachment inquiry, but he has declined to do so publicly.When asked by a CNN reporter why he has chosen not to do so, Nadler notably paused before dodging the question. One of the panel’s other members, the Pennsylvania representative Mary Gay Scanlon, then took the microphone to argue that impeachment “isn’t a binary thing”.The top Republican on the judiciary committee, the Georgia representative Doug Collins, criticized Nadler’s move.“Judiciary Democrats are suing for grand jury material to which they have no right,” Collins said in a statement. “Chairman Nadler’s legal action here is sure to fail, weakening Congress’s ability to conduct oversight now and into the future.“Nadler described the pending legal actions, including the McGahn lawsuit, as a potential watershed that could dismantle recent White House efforts to stonewall congressional investigators by directing current and former Trump aides to defy subpoenas and refrain from providing testimony.Mueller testified on Wednesday in back-to-back hearings that Democrats hoped would focus public attention on Trump’s alleged misconduct and boost support for an impeachment inquiry. But his halting and reticent performance changed few opinions, leaving House Democrats to accelerate a congressional inquiry that could take months to bear fruit.The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who opposes impeachment for now as a politically risky move for Democrats, told reporters that she favored litigation to obtain “the best, strongest possible case” against Trump.But with the 2020 election campaign season fast approaching, she also made it clear that the impeachment issue would not be allowed to linger.“The decision will be made in a timely fashion. This isn’t endless,” said Pelosi, who denied suggestions that she was trying to “run out the clock” on impeachment.Mueller found insufficient evidence to allege that the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow in its effort to help Trump get elected in 2016, although campaign officials met with Russians.He also reached no conclusions on whether Trump tried to obstruct Mueller’s inquiry.But he has also said the report does not exonerate the president. The 448-page document outlines 10 incidents of potential obstruction.Democrats say that testimony from McGahn could give them the evidence they need for an impeachment inquiry. McGahn told special counsel investigators that Trump directed him to seek Mueller’s removal and then to deny that he had been instructed to do so.Democrats view the alleged episode as an act of obstruction of justice.McGahn declined to testify earlier this year after the White House directed him not to cooperate with the committee.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d13d5d6673f2aff8a582c6739de8ac0b2c6e203/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0254df179a2094ddf0019d85114efe0","title":"mueller testimony democrats impeachment","story":"The special counsel sent a clear signal impeachment is not the way to go, experts say, despite the many Democrats in favourCameras stood ready. Photographers crouched. Reporters sat elbow to elbow with laptops on knees. Congressmen and women waited in their seats expectantly. And in he came: Robert Mueller, the former special counsel dubbed “America’s straightest arrow”, a man whose silent mystique was such that it took Robert De Niro to play him on TV.This packed committee room on Capitol Hill, with its high ceiling, wood panelled back wall and gold-framed portraits of politicians past was, some hoped, to be the scene of Donald Trump’s downfall as Mueller talked through his report on Russian election meddling, point by devastating point. “We want Bob Mueller to bring it to life,” the House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, had said.But once Wednesday’s seven-hour House committee hearings got under way, the welcoming smiles froze on Democratic faces, like a theatre audience realising they bought expensive tickets to the wrong show. It slowly dawned that Mueller was neither going to offer a pugnacious defence of his findings nor bring them into focus for the American public with piercing clarity. Instead the 74-year-old struggled, asking for questions to be repeated, laboriously looking up page references and offering halting, monosyllabic answers.Invited to deliver punchlines, he pulled his punches instead. When the New York congressman Hakeem Jeffries delivered a stirring soliloquy about defining obstruction of justice – “This is the United States of America! No one is above the law. No one. The president must be held accountable one way or the other” – and looked to Mueller for affirmation, the former FBI director replied: “Let me – let me just say I, if I might: I don’t subscribe necessarily to your – the way you analyse that. I’m not saying it’s out of the ballpark, but I’m not supportive of that analytical charge.”Soon enough the reviews were in: far from bringing the report to life, it was a dying fall, one that revealed Mueller to be a mere mortal after all. The backlash was swift.Comedian Bill Maher wrote on Twitter: “I can’t watch this anymore. Go home, guys. You made OJ try on the glove, and it just didn’t work. You can still win the election, but I wouldn’t bet my own money on it.”Michael Moore, the Oscar-winning documentary film-maker, tweeted: “A frail old man, unable to remember things, stumbling, refusing to answer basic questions...I said it in 2017 and Mueller confirmed it today — All you pundits and moderates and lame Dems who told the public to put their faith in the esteemed Robert Mueller — just STFU from now on.”What went wrong? Why did Democrats not realise that Mueller would not only be a unwilling witness but seemingly unversed in his own report? And was it, as Republicans gleefully claimed, the kiss of death to both the Russia investigation and demands for Trump’s impeachment?Some of it was predictable. The former special counsel had cautioned in advance that he had no intention of embellishing the report he published three months ago. Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to Bill Clinton, said: “Mr Mueller made his intentions crystal clear. He was not there to be a player in anyone’s movie. The Democrats may have thought they had little to lose and that Mr Mueller may be goaded by the more pugnacious Republicans into a moment that would go viral.”Some of it was a shock. The Washington Post reported: “Many felt blindsided that no one warned them how much Mueller had aged – and regretful that they had forced a decorated Vietnam veteran and longtime civil servant into testifying when he was so reluctant in the first place.”The perceived flop left some suggesting that Democrats are now flogging a dead horse and should change direction. The New York congressman Anthony Brindisi told the Post on Thursday: “Anyone who was looking for the smoking gun yesterday didn’t get it. It’s time to move on and focus on getting some bills passed here that can get signed into law.”But Democratic leaders argue there is a principle at stake. It is their constitutional duty, they say, to chase down every lead in the Mueller report, call more witnesses and put it all before the public. Failure to do so would imply that Trump is above the law and set the worst possible example for future presidents.At a press conference, the Maryland congressman Elijah Cummings spoke passionately about the big picture: “Martin Luther King said … ‘There comes a point when silence becomes betrayal.’ And we refuse to betray generations yet unborn and the American people. We’re not going to betray them. We’re accumulating information and doing the best we can … We’re going to do our part to make sure that we have a democracy that’s intact.”To that end, the hearings did enable Mueller to refute, on camera, Trump’s claim that Russian meddling is a “hoax”, that the investigation was a “witch-hunt” or that it gave him “total exoneration”. In rare expressions of opinion, Mueller described Trump’s praise of WikiLeaks as “problematic” and gravely warned that Russia will continue to attack US democracy. Future historians may judge the transcripts damning for the president.Nearly a hundred House Democrats favour impeachment and presumably hoped that Mueller’s testimony would be a game-changer. But Shrum said: “I think Wednesday sent a clear signal that’s not the way to go. The president would do everything to resist, put up roadblocks and challenge it in court. I think the best way to defeat him is at the ballot box. At this point impeachment is a distraction.”Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “Mueller’s lacklustre testimony likely gave Speaker Pelosi the ammunition to withstand calls for impeachment inquiries, or hearings, from the left flank of her party. She has always maintained it is a losing political proposition even if the House voted to impeach Trump because the Senate will not vote to convict Trump and remove him from office.”Although Mueller did not generate enough sound bites to be used across media platforms in the election campaign, Schiller added, “the lurking danger for Trump is that among independent voters, who leaned toward him in 2016, there is discomfort with the way he conducts himself.“For now, the strong economy is insulating Trump against that discomfort, but any downturn in the economy next summer or in fall 2020 might lead those voters to either stay home, or vote for someone other than Trump. And in some swing states, that could be enough to cost him the election.”The Democrats seeking the presidency have been talking about healthcare, economic inequality and racial injustice and saying much less about Mueller or impeachment on the campaign trail.Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank, said: “I think the candidates on the stump are being politically realistic the people back in Washington aren’t. Nancy Pelosi, who is a wintry eyed realist, is having none of it: she thinks impeachment is a fools’ errand and I have to say I agree with her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4440ffcd6c94dc3d6249264d623cae5063253a7e/0_115_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52b318d0ecafe1b3e101112cd1b7d4d8","title":"morbidly sensible adulting no way getting life insurance is empowering","story":"Does the thought of tackling life insurance send you into a slumber? Here’s why it could be worth giving it another shot …TV, takeaways and, erm, life insurance – I know which I’d rather commit to tonight when I get home. Admittedly, insurance isn’t exactly the sexiest of weeknight propositions, so it’s hardly any wonder so many of us choose to bury our heads in the proverbial sand when it comes to facing it. But before you fall into a slumber deeper than Snow White on a hangover, let me tell you why it might be worth giving it five minutes of your time (it won’t take any longer than that, promise).You see, life insurance is one of those things that makes perfect sense on paper - the kind of task you wonder why you didn’t get round to sorting once you realise what it actually involves (before swiftly ignoring it again for another six months, if you’re anything like me). I mean, think about it, how many important things have you taken the time to insure in your lifetime? I can name several - a car, the odd holiday, my home and a smartphone (or six). So why is it we’re neglecting to insure the most important thing of all?A quick straw poll of my friends reveals the many reasons we don’t. Some figure that not having children, a partner, or owning a home, means they don’t need it – they reason there’s no point spending money on something they don’t actually need yet. But if either of those things could plausibly happen in the near future, it might be worth planning ahead (after all, you’ll have more pressing things to worry about once any #wedmin kicks in, and doing it sooner likely means lower monthly payments, too). It’s also worth asking whether any dependants or loved ones would be financially stable without you, since life insurance could take care of that (something not many of us like to think about, granted).Life insurance could also be very useful for anybody jointly responsible for mortgage payments. What happens if one person dies before the mortgage is paid (nope, not a fun discussion but an important one)? Experts flag that we shouldn’t assume death-in-service cover or life insurance via your employer means we don’t need to worry about life insurance, either, unfortunately. While useful, workplace cover tends to pay out benefits as a multiple of salary (eg four-years’ salary) to ensure your family has cash available to make up for the loss of your salary to maintain their lifestyle it may not cover any large financial commitments, such as a mortgage.What are the available options? Well, Aviva offers three types of life insurance: cover that remains the same, and so do the payments cover and premiums that increase over time and cover that decreases.For the latter, the value of the cover goes down each month, but your regular payments stay the same. People usually use this product to cover a repayment mortgage, which also decreases.If you’re looking to help cover your salary and maintain loved ones’ living standards or to settle your mortgage and provide reassurance – then you may want to go for the same level, or increasing if you want some protection against the effects of inflation. Still with me? Good.The best part is there’s minimal legwork – most customers could get a quote and decision in just over five minutes (reading this is probably the most arduous part, sorry) and it might be cheaper than you think, with policies starting at around £5 a month. So we could all start protecting our loved ones immediately.Pretty awesome, right? And probably much smarter than putting it off until your next birthday, and spending more when we do bite the bullet (since policies tend to get more expensive the older you are). Making that decision suddenly feels like a no-brainer to me – what about you?

But pressure for change is building On Wednesday, Sadam Abdusalam went to Australia’s federal Parliament House for the first time and spent almost 12 hours meeting politicians – meetings he has spent almost two years hoping for – in which he pleaded for their help to bring his wife and nearly two-year-old son home.Last week Abdusalam’s story was broadcast on Four Corners, detailing how his wife and son are trapped in China because they are Uighurs – ethnic minority Muslims.It was not the first time he had told his story publicly – he first did so to Buzzfeed in February, and then to  Australia in April, when  Australia revealed there were at least five Australian children trapped in China due to the country’s increasingly brutal crackdown on Uighur people in the far-west region of Xinjiang.But it was the first time Abdusalam had revealed his identity, and feels as though things might finally be shifting for his family. He hopes his wife and son might soon be able to come to Australia – ideally in time for his son’s second birthday on 31 August – meaning he could meet his son for the first time.While Abdusalam is grateful for the support the government is showing his family now, he says on his recent trip to Canberra he struggled with a question the entire Uighur community is grappling with.“I wanted to tell them: ‘Where have you been the last few years?’”It is almost a year since the United Nations reported that an estimated one million people, mostly Uighurs, were being held in detention centres across Xinjiang and urged China to release them.Even before then, there were regular reports that Uighurs were subject to extraordinary surveillance, required to give blood, DNA and biometric face scans, forced to hand over their passports, denied permission to leave Xinjiang and detained in huge numbers. China has finally been forced to admit the detention centres exist, but still insists they are “vocational training centres”. Uighurs may be held there for crimes such as having a beard, having a Muslim name, having WhatsApp on their phone, having family members who live abroad, or for no apparent reason at all.But it was only two weeks ago that a statement was issued by 22 countries condemning China’s treatment of Uighur and other minorities. So why has it taken so long for the world to care about the plight of the Uighurs?“It has been taking a surprisingly long time,” says Nury Turkel, chairman of the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington. “There are a couple of reasons: one is obviously the China factor. It’s a big country, kind of a reckless country, governments are often very careful to take a stand.”James Leibold, an associate professor in politics and Asian studies at Melbourne’s La Trobe University, says China’s economic clout and other countries’ reluctance to rock the trade boat is clearly a factor, but there are others. Most people in the west have not heard of Uighurs or Xinjiang – a very remote part of China – and awareness of their plight has not been championed by a figure well-known in the west, as the Tibetan situation was by the Dalai Lama.Then there is the difficulty in getting information out of Xinjiang. China has restricted access to foreign journalists, other than those taken on bizarre propaganda tours, so reporters have largely been left to rely on accounts of escapees and the diaspora as well as satellite imagery to try to piece together what is going on there.“The informational warfare that’s occurring at present … gives cover to governments or allows governments not to respond because they will say: ‘We don’t really know what’s happening’,” says Leibold.China has exacted severe retribution against those who have spoken out, including Abdusalam’s wife who, since the Four Corners broadcast, has been taken in by police almost every day and questioned for three or four hours.“They have been telling her to tell me to keep my mouth shut,” says Abdusalam. “She’s really frightened.”“No one wants to talk, with good reason,” says Leibold.China has also walked a “very deliberate and very careful” line in committing serious human rights abuses without perpetrating the sort of physical violence that might attract widespread global condemnation, says Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch.“I think part of the reason this is under the radar is that people aren’t overtly being killed or raped or tortured.” Despite this, Pearson says what China is doing in Xinjiang is “absolutely terrifying”.“They are blueprinting a way of eradicating Muslim identity from a population and I think that’s something we should all be quite scared about.“We spend so much time and energy on this religious freedom debate in Australia well here’s a group of people that are about to be exterminated in terms of their religion,” says Pearson.Leibold says a “subtle, unarticulated bias against Islam” may also go some way to explain why the “slow-burning act of cultural genocide” in Xinjiang has not gained traction in western countries.“Muslims unfortunately have very little sympathy globally at the moment. There is this spectre of Islamophobia globally that sits behind this issue,” says Leibold.Turkel believes things have shifted in recent months. In Washington DC, where he is based, there is momentum for legislation enforcing targeted sanctions at senior Chinese officials.But Australia could do more, he says. “I would like to see the Australian government be a little more steady and outspoken,” he says, particularly in light of the five Australian children, including Abdusalam’s, who are trapped in Xinjiang, unable to return home to their Australian parents.“It should keep Australian politicians awake at night.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3968688.1564173912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jacob rees mogg esq releases set of rules to new staff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg (C) speaking in the Houses of Parliament flanked by Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson (L) and Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid. Photograph: Jessica TaylorUK ParliamentAFPGetty ImagesLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has issued a set of rules for staff in his office to follow, including a list of banned words and a requirement to use imperial measurements.Mr Rees-Mogg, who was brought into the government by Boris Johnson on Wednesday, wasted little time in issuing the guidance to staff.According to the style guide obtained by ITV News, Mr Rees-Mogg insists that all non-titled males are given the suffix Esq- short for Esquire - and says words including “ongoing” and “hopefully” are banned.In a call for accuracy, he tells staff: “CHECK your work.”The guidance was drawn up by Mr Rees-Mogg’s North East Somerset constituency team some years ago, but has now been shared with officials in his new office.Other directions include a call for a double space after full stops and no comma after the word “and”.He also set out a series of banned words and phrases that should not be used by his staff.They include: very, due to, unacceptable, equal, yourself, lot, got, speculate, meet with, ascertain and disappointment.Staff should avoid “too many ‘Is’” in their writing, Mr Rees-Mogg will not be “pleased to learn” anything, he will not “noteunderstand your concerns” nor will he “invest (in schools etc)”, and the phrase “no longer fit for purpose” has been deemed no longer fit for purpose.As chair of the European Research Group - an influential, hard-Brexit Conservative backbench grouping - Mr Rees-Mogg has increased his influence in Westminster in recent years. The official transcript of parliamentary proceedings, Hansard, records more than 700 instances of Mr Rees-Mogg using one or other of the banned words or phrases. He is an Old Etonian, like the prime minister he serves, and, like the prime minister he serves, has cultivated a reputation for formality and upper-class eccentricity, gaining the nickname the “honourable member for the 18th century”. When standing for the Conservatives for the Central Fife seat in 1997, he took his nanny and his mother’s Mercedes out canvassing. Mr Rees-Mogg has also used his position of influence to argue against abortion, even in cases of rape, and same-sex marriage. He has been one of the most prominent backers of a hard Brexit and, last year, it was revealed that a City firm he co-founded had set up an investment fund in Ireland and was warning prospective clients about the financial dangers of a hard Brexit.

He had flown for 11 miles at speeds of up to 87 mph, 50 feet above the waves.Divers from the refuelling boat pulled him out of the water unhurt with his ‘Flyboard’, which he designed and built himself.Stéphane Denis, a member of Mr Zapata’s support team, said: “It is a huge disappointment. He made his rendez-vous with the refuelling boat, but the landing platform touched his ‘Flyboard’. That threw him off balance and he fell into the water.” Mr Denis added that he would make another attempt, probably within weeks.  It took him 10 minutes to reach the boat and if he had managed to strap on a new fuel pack and lift off again, he would have expected to reach St Margaret’s Bay, near Dover, in another 10 minutes. It would have been the first Channel crossing on a hoverboard.Franky Zapata stands on his jet-powered \u0026#39flyboard\u0026#39 as he takes off from Sangatte, northern FranceMr Zapata, a former jet-ski champion from Marseille, was reportedly furious at the failure. He blamed French maritime authorities who had refused to allow him to refuel in mid-air. He had wanted to refuel twice, once over French waters and another over UK waters.British authorities did not oppose the plan, but the French deemed it too dangerous. French commentators said the French refused because they were more concerned about safety, while the “Anglo-Saxons” were more relaxed, provided other people were not put at risk.  Mr Zapata, nicknamed “Flyman” by French media, had planned the attempt to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the first cross-Channel flight by Louis Blériot, the French aviation pioneer.During an early test flight when he was developing the turbo-powered ‘Flyboard’, two of his fingers were torn off after he collided with a wall and caught his hand in the turbines.He delighted French leaders by soaring over their heads at the Bastille Day military parade in Paris. Emmanuel Macron, the president, compared him to James Bond.

It includes 75 articles with hefty sanctions for those who mow the lawn outside designated hours, walk their dog without a leash or dump their rubbish in public places.“We have taken a series of measures to contain all those uncivilised activities that make coexistence difficult,” Mr Stefan said.“It will no longer be possible to cut the lawn at certain times, dogs must be kept on a leash and those who are blasphemous will pay the consequences.“We want to send a message that incorrect behaviour will no longer be tolerated.”Mr Stefan, a father of three, is not aligned with any major political party and has been mayor of the town since 2012. He was re-elected in 2017 with 52.2 percent of the vote.He said flyers in four languages, including Chinese and Romanian, would be sent to residents in September to inform them about the new fines.“There may be bigger problems around but we can’t consider civility banal, he said. If we let this go, young people will become louts.“We want to create a courteous community and behaviour that prevents conflict.”Omero Badon, a local councillor from the Five Star Movement, said he supported the law but did not know if the fines would be enough to improve behaviour, especially that of young people, in the community.Blasphemy was decriminalised in Italy in 1999 but certain sanctions remain for offences against the “deity”.  In December last year a man was fined €100 for blasphemy in front of a school in Albisola Superiore near Savona.US Supreme Court allows Trump to spend military funds on US-Mexico border wall construction Boris Johnson rules out calling election before October 31, as Brexit Party prepares to reveal MP candidatesPhones and washing machines must be made to last, MPs say as Government launches inquiry into \u0026#39Tsunami\u0026#39 of e-wasteProsecutions against unsafe care homes and hospitals rise by one thirdComment: At last, we have a Brexit government – and one that is ready to win the battleJacob Rees-Mogg: Why I gave my new staff a grammar lesson and etiquette guide Boris Johnson warned that \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit will require return of \u0026#39direct rule\u0026#39 in Northern Ireland Britain\u0026#39s top diplomats encouraged to use gender-neutral \u0026#39zie\u0026#39 pronouns in official memosJacob Rees-Mogg dares Remainer rebels to revoke Article 50 as it\u0026#39s the \u0026#39only way to stop Brexit\u0026#39Sir Nick Clegg claimed £113,000 in expenses for public duties in same year he joined FacebookJulian Smith fails to commit to Boris Johnson\u0026#39s promise to stop \u0026#39unfair\u0026#39 Northern Ireland veterans prosecutionsMet police \u0026#39fanned the flames\u0026#39 of Carl Beech\u0026#39s false allegations of Westminster paedophile ring UK heatwave: airport and rail passengers severely delayed after thunderstorms bring misery to start of summer holidaysJohn Fogerty and Jay-Z pull out of Woodstock 50 as anniversary festival flounders Libya transfers migrants rescued from year\u0026#39s worst shipwreck back to bombed detention centreTeenager cleared of murdering his friend filmed himself making stabbing motions during trialVictim of domestic abuse goes into hiding after blunders let her violent husband out of jail earlyComment: ERG hardliners threaten to sacrifice Brexit at the altar of ideological purity\tTrump threatens tariffs on French wine in response to Macron\u0026#39s \u0026#39digital tax\u0026#39 We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/16/09/cobham.jpg","title":"cobham aerospace contractor takeover us bidder advent international pound dollar exchange rate","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsCreated with Sketch.Inside Business:\u0026nbspMore deals like the £4bn\u0026nbsptakeover of defence firm Cobham\u0026nbspby a US bidder are on the horizonClick to followThe IndependentThere are so many bad things happening in Britain right now that the overseas takeover of yet another big British business, one that actually makes things and sells them overseas, seems barely to have been noticed.\u0026nbspAnother reason is perhaps that Cobham, an aerospace and defence business that has agreed to a £4bn bid from American buyout firm Advent International, is hardly a household name.\u0026nbspIt is perhaps best known as a pioneer of air to air refuelling tech, but it also supplies electronic and radar equipment to the civilian aerospace as well as the defence industry. Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspFootasylum could run a lot faster under JD’s wing after £90m takeoverCobham hit by US defence spending cutsAdvent’s offer represents a 34 per cent premium over Wednesday’s closing share price, and it looks like a shoo-in to get the 75 per cent support from shareholders that\u0026nbspit requires for the deal to go through.The premium looks like a tasty one, and the majority of its investors will likely sign up in a heartbeat.\u0026nbspFor a start, the board has backed it unanimously, as has Artemis, one of\u0026nbspits bigger institutional shareholders. While the company has found its feet of late, its recent history has not been entirely happy. It issued a string of profit warnings between 2015 and 2017. In the last of those years it tapped shareholders for an emergency £500m to help with a debt-mountain built up in part through a botched acquisition.\u0026nbspThe new shares, issued through the cash call, were priced at 75p. Investors who signed up and held on to them are getting 165p in cash from Advent. Cha-ching.\u0026nbspCould Cobham have got there on its own, though? The shares were at a higher level than that as recently as the beginning of 2016. It might seem like a tall order given Britain’s desperate political climate, but the question is rarely asked even when things are going well. The rule in the City is you take the money and run when it’s offered. \u0026nbspAnother rarely raised question, unless the company involved is a big household name, is whether the deal is a good one for this country.\u0026nbspIn the case of Cobham, the government may not even need to lie about this being an investment in Britain that shows off its vim.\u0026nbspAdvent has surely been assisted by the climate that government has created. Its behaviour has so tarnished Sterling that shares denominated in the UK’s currency are unnaturally cheap for overseas bidders, which can therefore afford to make their offers look generous.\u0026nbspWith the requirement to act like a good little vassal of the US, any muted objections to the deal will fall on deaf ears. There’ll be no question of using the slightly beefed up powers the government has to halt takeovers involving sensitive companies like this one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Some fans have been waiting up for six\u0026nbsphours to hear the new album.Other have been speculating that Kanye West’s involvement in the album could have led to its delay, given his reputation as a perfectionist.Chance the Rapper has been teasing the release of his new material on Twitter for weeks, writing “the day is on its way” and announcing a Spotify launch party which took place on Thursday night.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The sun beating down. No one around for miles. We all have our desert island fantasies. How might you fare marooned on a strange land? Could you fend for yourself? In the spirit of Robinson Crusoe, I’ve decided to spend five days castaway on an uninhabited island in the south Pacific.\u0026nbspThe place is Kabakon, one of Papua New Guinea’s 13 Duke of York islands, 800km east of the capital Port Moresby. It is owned by the tribe who live on the neighbouring island of Karawara, who use it as their garden.A hotel on the mainland sets up the basics for me but, to all extents and purposes, it is a term of solitary confinement. Just me and my flimsy penknife. Bouncing over the waves to the island, we pass the steaming volcano Tavurvur, a startling reminder that I’m slap bang on\u0026nbspthe Pacific ring of fire.\u0026nbspThen we run into a pod of frolicking dolphins, which\u0026nbspskip along with the boat like they’re old friends. It’s a cheery omen for the adventure ahead.After about 45 minutes,\u0026nbspKabakon\u0026nbspheaves into view.The island is\u0026nbsp80 hectares of white sand, fringed with palms and blue water, and is as close to a paradisiacal idyll as I have ever seen. There’s no luxury here. I’m staying in a two-roomed shack with a mattress on the floor, mosquito net, and some chairs and a table on the veranda. The hotel has provided basic food – bread, dried noodles, fruit and a few tins. There’s no wifi or TV\u0026nbspno signs of digital life. Nothing to tie me to the world outside.Showing me the ropes is Corey Eron, councillor of Karawara, and the brainchild of the trip. He wants to encourage tourism to the island to help the village economy. He is an idealist but practical with it and charismatic to boot. His dreads shake with mirth as his infectious laughter punctuates the conversation. You can see why the islanders hold him in high regard, voting him their council representative every year for the past seven.\u0026nbspHe’ll keep me company some of the time but I’ve told him I need to do this alone.\u0026nbspMy first task is to explore the island. My shack faces Karawara in the east with the mountains of New Ireland shimmering dimly in the distance. The side I’m on is beach and sand while the other is tall rocky cliffs that block the battering encroachment of the sea. Inland is thick vegetation and the Karawaran garden. I determine to walk around the island, which should take two to three hours…\u0026nbspprobably.A guy stops on the path and pulls out some betel nuts and lime powder from his bag, which I chew, turning my lips red. I’m invited to eat taro (root) and freshly cooked fish stew. And I’m offered homebrewKabakon is filled with curious life. Blue and red starfish and sea cucumbers bask in the water, little darting fish weave between your toes. Inland, there are red-beaked parrots, multicoloured lizards and black and white willie wagtail birds with their absurd rear-end movement like they’re doing the twist. The plant life is equally fascinating. Spiky pandanus palms and coconuts dominate but there is also a single huge banyan tree, the tallest on the island and for miles around, with roots hanging like thick dark ropes from the trunk. As I’m walking along, I come across a sudden bloom of colourful flowers and weeping willow trees, which seem incongruous in their surroundings.In fact, this is part of Kabakon’s strange history.\u0026nbspIn 1902, the island was bought by one August\u0026nbspEngelhardt, a 26-year-old German, who was looking for somewhere to develop his utopian philosophy based on principles of sun worship and cocovorism\u0026nbsp– the notion that eating nothing but coconuts is key to solving man’s physical ailments. He’d come into a substantial inheritance and purchased Kabakon for his new Eden.The first few years were idyllic. Engelhardt established a coconut plantation and called his followers to join\u0026nbsphim in this brave new world. They called themselves Sonnenorden and practised sun worship and nudity and lived off coconuts. But it didn’t last. The alien living conditions took their toll and several died. Others turned their back on him. Engelhardt was eventually left alone, was gripped by malaria and\u0026nbspwent insane. He died aged 46 and was rumoured to have been\u0026nbspburied on the neighbouring island of Mioko, though his grave was never found.The ghost of this eccentric man occupies me as I weave my way around the island, but progress is hard. The vegetation is thick and my path is blocked by tall plants draped in spiderwebs, while the cliffs prevent me walking along the water. Eventually, I decide to turn inland, where I stumble upon the village plantations.The island garden is a beautiful sight. Immaculately tended plots of banana and coconut trees mixed with yams, peanuts and all kinds of tropical fruit. It looks, indeed, very Edenic. But I’ve now no idea where I am or how to get back. Even as I’m thinking that I might be stuck a young face appears from the undergrowth.“The beach path?” he asks.“Yes,” I say sheepishly, trying to excuse my intrusion and wondering if I have trampled on his hard work.He gestures me to follow, then asks if I’d like to eat some singapo. Unsure what it is, I say yes – in for a penny, in for a pound. He takes me up a different path where we come upon a group of boys cooking yams on a fire. One offers me the singapo: “Crunchy,” he says, while another asks if I want a kulao (green coconut). I nod and he immediately leaps on to the base of a 30ft-coconut tree and starts shimmying up using no more than a leaf harness hooked round his feet. In a flash, he’s up there hacking down coconuts, suspended upside down with one hand. Madness, I think, and eat the purple, smoked yam and drink water fresh from the coconut with a new appreciation.The islanders are quick with humour and generous to a fault. It’s one of\u0026nbspmy first lessons about\u0026nbspthe Karawaran people. Language might be an issue but communication is easy\u0026nbspthey are charming.Later I chat with Corey about life here. It looks like paradise but living isn’t easy. The relentless march of modernity is inescapable. Customs are being eroded. The islanders used to trade exclusively with shell money (kina) but that is dying off as notes and coin currency become de facto. With coconuts and fish, the island’s only two money earners, it is harder to buy things.Corey says they are lucky to have the garden island, which provides them with food. But for everything else, they need money. Better medicine, for example –\u0026nbspseven people died of malaria last year. Or school equipment, and clothes. The PNG government is well-intentioned but notoriously poor in execution. The country draws explorers and anthropologists to the fascination of a land that has over 800 languages, wild and ancient tribes and customs, some that seem truly outlandish and brutal to us. Yet the real trouble here is not the ancient customs but modern governmental mismanagement, which\u0026nbspis unlikely to change soon.Corey’s grandmother once tasted human flesh. She told of how the tribe caught a man, tied him up, removed his eyes and turned his head around, then kept him by the fire still alive for three days while they collected sweet potatoes until finally he was thrown inCollapsed on\u0026nbspmy mattress, I’m ready to sleep but the night brings strange noises and even stranger visitors. Things come hissing and creeping into my feverish mind. It seems to take hours until finally, hot and sweaty, I’m soothed by the sounds of the tropical rain that thrums on\u0026nbspthe thatched roof and fall into a deep slumber.In the morning I find the table covered in delicate ant wings, their bodies seared off by the lamp I left lit overnight. It is something of a symbolic sacrifice.Waking on the second day there is a pull for the familiar. The desire for something you know, because you’re stuck here in these unfamiliar surroundings. I wonder what the weather is like back home. If Boris is PM yet. Whether anyone’s missing me.\u0026nbspI walk along the sands until I come upon a man tying crabs he caught overnight. They call him “Sir Crab” because he is a specialist in\u0026nbspcatching them.\u0026nbsp“The crabs are clever,” he says, “so you have to be cleverer than them.”He gives me two freshly caught mud crabs, which, when\u0026nbspboiled,\u0026nbspproduce the freshest meat broken off the shell. Simplicity and patience are key here. Life is slow and meandering. Villagers paddle along in their canoes to the sound of birds and the rik rik of crickets. You quickly\u0026nbsplearn there’s no need to chase time.Corey takes me to Karawara. At every turn, the islanders greet me\u0026nbspwarmly. A man stops on the path and pulls out some betel nuts and lime powder from his bag, which I chew, turning my lips red. I’m invited to eat taro\u0026nbspand freshly cooked fish stew and drink\u0026nbsphomebrew. The village is just 30 minutes walk from one end to the other but is so overflowing with life, generosity and community that I wonder how or why this place is slowly slipping away to western mores.It’s clear the spirit of Engelhardt endures. One of the men shows me old photos of him – whom they call Tokelau or Mr Coconut – sitting on a chair looking into the camera with a haunted expression on his face. Apparently\u0026nbsphe was a good man but the customs – nudism and all – disconcerted them. Some called him a ghost.Papua New Guinea hit with 6.4-magnitude earthquakeThe local legends and myths border on the fantastically insane but somehow seem believable here. Corey speaks of the magic men who went through extreme initiations, fasting for months, eating 20 or more ginger roots in a go, and other crazy acts of torture before they acquired magic powers. These men could become tiny and transport themselves to different places by stepping on rocks or were carried around by flying foxes. They had power over nature – asking the coconut tree to bend down and provide them with coconuts.There are darker things too. Cannibalism. Corey’s grandmother, who died aged 115 last year, tasted human flesh. She told of how the tribe caught a man, tied him up, removed his eyes and turned his head around, then kept him by the fire still alive for three days while they collected sweet potatoes until finally throwing him in – a custom which has fortunately also slipped away.At some point, I express an interest in fishing and lo and behold the next morning four boys rock up in their boat with spearguns and goggles and take me with them to the other side of the island to catch fish. The boat stops and sways as waves dash\u0026nbspagainst the rocky face. I’m feeling a\u0026nbsplittle grim but try not to show it. Wilson hands me my fishing tool – a homemade speargun that’s been whittled out of wood with a thick rubber band attached to it. I’m supposed to get in the water and load this with a spear before catching something.“Don’t point it at anyone, it goes off easy,” he warns.I’m not convinced by their chances, but the boys are specialists, ing with ease like they have since they were kids. I’m less effective but it’s exhilarating all the same. The coral is teeming with marine life yet to be diminished by overfishing. We return with a bucket of multicoloured tropical fish that we\u0026nbspsmoke\u0026nbspover the fire and share. I doubt I’ve had fresher – straight from sea to coals to stomach.On my last evening, I sit on the sand\u0026nbspand watch villagers paddling back to their island, canoes loaded with crops. Songs echo out into the air as the light fades and the mountains in the distance get dimmer and dimmer and then…\u0026nbspsilence. Just the waves and the darkness and the stars, hundreds and thousands of them, glimmering in the sky.It is a place of perfect peace.The mornings have been a little overcast so far but the final day brings a cloudless blue sky. The sun is peeping over the distant mountains of New Ireland. I rush to the water and see it rising, shyly at first, then exploding into golden beams that illuminate the world. Augustus would have been happy. But there is a final twist to the tale.While we are waiting for the boat to take us back to the mainland, one of the villagers – Vapot, a quiet one who speaks little English – tells Corey that two Germans came in 2002 and she and some of the other villagers went with them and dug up bones in the north of the island.It was the same spot where Augustus planted his flowers. I’m frankly agog. But then again there’s nothing too fanciful about this strange, crazy, beautiful place that should surprise me. He was right here all along.The trip was organised through the PNG Tourism Authority. Air Niugini flies daily from Singapore\u0026nbspto Port Moresby and has connecting flights to Rabaul.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.“It’s been three years but your advice still inspire me,” she wrote. “This is me now and I feel way more confident. Thank you Mark.”On that occasion too, Ruffalo replied, writing back: “Looking good! Happy to hear it’s going well. Best.”Last month, the fan posted screenshots from her past exchanges with the actor and shared a new update.“Even though I’m having a hard time, I’m still trying to follow your advice to love myself. Thank you again Mark,” she wrote.On Friday, the actor retweeted her message, adding: “Look at you! It sounds so easy to say ‘love yourself’ but like anything worth a damn in life it takes practice, patience, and your daily attention.“When those concepts are applied, especially patience, we can change ourselves and even the world around us.”Ruffalo’s message has received 32,000 likes and has been met with hundreds of comments, many of which are commanding him for his supportive attitude.The actor, who plays Bruce Banner  the Hulk in the MCU, was most recently seen in Avengers:\u0026nbspEndgame\u0026nbspin April.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018After the deal, Intel will retain the right to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, industrial equipment and self-driving cars.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakModem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks, but Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part. Intel has positioned itself as the sole source of iPhone modem chips over the past year after Apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier Qualcomm over patent licensing practices.Apple, based in\u0026nbspCupertino, California,\u0026nbspreached a surprise settlement in April that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips. Within hours, Intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business.Apple’s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies, making the Intel deal its second-largest ever after its $3.2bn purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.The deal with Intel will bolster Apple’s goal to make its own modem chip. Two of Apple’s biggest global rivals – Samsung Electronics and Huawei – already have the ability to self-supply modem chips.Technology news publication The Information last year reported Apple’s efforts to develop its own modem, but the iPhone maker\u0026nbspnever formally acknowledged it. In February, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signalling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.Apple chief executive Tim Cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate – analysts call this\u0026nbspthe “Cook Doctrine”.“We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make,” Tim Cook told investors back in 2009.The purchase of Intel’s assets could help Apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem.A person familiar with the matter said Apple plans to use Qualcomm’s modem technology for a 5G iPhone in 2020 but wants to have its own ready for use\u0026nbspby 2021.But any replacement of Qualcomm is likely to happen in phases, this person said, as Apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where it sells phones. Ensuring worldwide compatibility is Qualcomm’s historical strength, and Apple might still have to rely on the firm\u0026nbspfor some modems during a transition period to its own devices.“There’s a fierce desire (at Apple) to have independence, but they also realise it has to be done responsibly,” this person said.Apple’s licence deal with Qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long, said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Apple is likely to continue to use the San Diego firm’s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower-end and older models, this person said.Apple has engaged with Taiwan’s Global Unichip Corp, a chip design house in which Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is an investor, to explore a modem design, but the work is in early stages.“Clearly Apple saw the handwriting on the wall, because they came around and did a deal with Qualcomm,” this person said.Apple declined to comment on its plans, and Qualcomm and Global Unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The most valuable aspect of the Intel deal for Apple could turn out to be patents. To sell a 5G iPhone, Apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5G patents, including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Qualcomm. Apple executed a licensing deal with Qualcomm, but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others.Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who had worked in Qualcomm’s licensing ision in Asia, said the patents could give Apple better leverage in licensing talks.“I don’t think Intel has quite the portfolio that Qualcomm has, but they certainly have a large enough one to impact the valuations when it comes to a cross-licensing deal,” he said. “It’ll save (Apple) a huge chunk of change in cross-licence deals.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another flame flew out of the top of the rocket, as can be seen on the video.The rocket itself appeared to survive without problems, but it is just the latest in a run of issues. It came a week after the Starhopper craft flew a fireball out of its bottom during another test.It was the first time that SpaceX has allowed one of the tests to be streamed.

Company results usually come out at 7am, but by 8am on Friday, when the stock market opened, the results were still missing, all planned calls with the media and analysts were cancelled and a presentation to investors at the retailer’s London head office was scrapped.A spokesman for Sports Direct said: “Unfortunately we are still finalising preliminary results. We anticipate that our annual results will still be released today, with a presentation to follow.”The company then issued updates at midday and 2pm, each time saying it was still finalising the report.

In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab626 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1926 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker.

Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1926 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.Rocky\u0026nbspproducer Irwin Winkler told\u0026nbspVariety\u0026nbspthe team are “very anxious” to make the film, and that negotiations are currently underway with Stallone.The most recent movie in the franchise,\u0026nbspRocky Balboa, came out in 2006.Two spin-off films,\u0026nbspCreed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspCreed II, were released in 2015 and 2018.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist. That’s what the people at the Stonewall Inn did that fateful night in 1969. They resisted arrest and the status quo because they knew that their right to love and exist was equal to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.’‘Growing up I just did not see myself reflected within the history books. But when I found out that it was Marsh P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two transgender women of colour, who kicked off the Stonewall riots which lead to the gay rights movement... If filled me with pride.’‘I think perhaps the most glorious fact of the Stonewall riots is that it was the queens, the camp, glitzy queens who saw off the police that night in Greenwich Village. Years of mockery in the streets, being jostled, spat at, arrested and pushed off the sidewalk had toughened them up.’‘Trans women of colour have always stood at the forefront of this movement. Some try to erase the legacies but it’s still apparent in today’s climate that trans women are as bold as ever.’‘I am eternally grateful to those who fought for the recognition of gay identity at a time when society saw it only in crude sexual terms. Stonewall was about the freedom to love without fear.’850 Ruth Hunt, CEO of Stonewall‘We named ourselves after this historic moment and we continue to honour those involved by naming the meeting rooms in our London office after some of the leaders, including a lesbian woman of colour called Storme DeLarverie and two trans women of colour, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson.’950 Rikki Beadle-Blair, creator and performer‘I put my heart and soul into the script for Stonewall. And they’re all there: the butches, the fems, the blacks and hiics and whites. The middle-class activists. The street queens. The homeless queer kids. And they are still here, with us in every battle we still have to fight.’‘It laid the foundation for all the campaigns for LGBT+ equality that followed: against Section 28, for an equal age of consent, for equal access to services, for equal marriage, for justice around the world in the face of hostility and violence and bigotry.’‘The Stonewall riots were the spark that galvanised the LGBT+ community to organise in support for our rights. From homosexuality being a criminal offence, to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer.’1250 Shon Faye, writer and comedian‘While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.’‘Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.’1450 Tamal Ray, baker and doctor‘Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do.’‘In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health.’‘Those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard-won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law.  Prejudice persists. The fight continues.’1750 Shahmir Sanni, whistleblower and digital strategist‘In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on BAME sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us.’1850 Travis Alabanza, performer and activist‘It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory - but always in practice, on the streets, together.’‘The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and others have been carried though time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve.’2050 Michael Cashman, politician, actor and co-founder of Stonewall‘For me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel‘s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community.’‘It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.’‘I was born in the year of the Stonewall riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. Its a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are.’‘Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge, so that our heroes are never forgotten.’‘Trans people, especially trans women of colour, need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.’2550 Lea DeLaria, actor and comedian‘That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.’‘Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.’‘We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour - especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei.’2850 Phillip Picardi , journalist and editor-in-chief of OUT magazine‘This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.’‘On that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said no to state-sanctioned police brutality.’‘A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks. It serves to push back even harder and negate the strides we have already made.’3150 Jide Macaulay, pastor and activist‘As a black African British gay Christian living with HIV, it’s a reminder of the continuous fight for inclusion, liberation and ersity, to be respected for who I am and who I love.’Pride in LondonYouTube‘Will those corporations be aligned with us once the parade inevitably turns back to a protest?’‘Stonewall was the founding legend that we all learn from and we must stand tall as one community and one voice so we can pave the way for the new generations.’‘Trump and other emerging nationalists worldwide tend to hold a dim view of gay people. So we must our fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.’‘News that there is to be a straight pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s June 28 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence.’‘As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969.’3750 Jake Graf, actor and writer‘When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour.’3850 Lisa Power, co-founder of Stonewall‘We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot.’3950 Matthew Todd, author and journalist‘When a lesbian, we think Stormé DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme – did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me.’‘The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we\u0027ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away.’4150 Joseph Galliano, CEO and co-founder of the Queer Britain Museum‘Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.’‘It\u0027s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles.’4350 Glynn Fussel, performer and creator‘I\u0027m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don\u0027t have the rights that we have. Every single day we should remember the fights that came before us.’Sink the Pink‘Small towns now celebrate their LGBT citizens and the police are no longer hostile. That is progress of which we should all be proud.’‘What matters most to me about Stonewall was that it was one protest of many, one moment in time across decades of rebellion, building community, making our mark.’4650 Andrew Lumsden, journalist and activist‘The uprising brought us the word “gay”. When it crossed the Atlantic to us in 1970 as the Gay Liberation Front, which I promptly joined, none of us had ever before used the word in the sense of sexual orientation. And I\u0027m glad we did.’‘The stonewall riots were not only a moment in time and history, but a real signal that we are not a community that is to stay quiet and remain silenced.’‘However we should remember that there are so many stories of queer join, pain, struggle and victory out there to be discovered, if we take the time to look for them.’‘While many of us feel safe and accepted, Pride is about remembering that there are still people in the world who don’t. Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.’5050 Carrie Lyell, journalist and editor-in-chief of DIVA magazine‘What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’‘When I heard about Stonewall, I remember feeling just like the famous line in the movie Network – I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more. Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist.

So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’The unnamed 27-year-old was reportedly told by officials his behaviour was “not authentic” in a high-profile asylum case last year.The decision was the second time Austrian authorities had refused an asylum case on the grounds they did not believe the applicant was gay.The treatment of LGBT+ asylum seekers in Britain has also come under the spotlight\u0026nbspamid\u0026nbspreports of vulnerable\u0026nbspapplicants struggling to provide adequate proof of their sexuality.The proportion of asylum claims from members of the LGBT+ community that have been rejected by the Home Office has surged in recent years, government data released last year showed.In total, 78 per cent of asylum claims that included a reference to sexual orientation were refused last year 1,464 people – up from 964 rejected claims in 2015.This is what LGBTQI+ people go through to gain asylum in the UKDr Tschalaer’s study found people who were more open about their sexuality and gender identity in their country of origin as well as the country of arrival were much more likely to be granted asylum, in part because they were more likely to receive support for the preparation of their asylum interview.Her research suggested\u0026nbspthose who felt unable to be open about their sexuality prior to leaving their home country were at a disadvantage when applying for asylum.LGBTQI+ asylum seekers who felt forced to hide their sexuality andor gender identity, and who felt uncomfortable talking about it were usually rejected, as were those who were married or had children in their countries of origin,” she said.“This was either because they were not recognised or believed as being LGBTQI+, or because they were told to hide in their country of origin since they had not come out yet.”anti-LGBT+ countries in Europe, according to ILGA-EuropeLeila Zadeh, director of the UK Lesbian \u0026amp Gay Immigration Group (UKLGIG), urged European governments to stop basing decisions on whether to grant asylum to LGBTQI+ people based on a person’s ability to articulate a coming out story’ in line with Western stereotypes”.She told The Independent: UKLGIG research has similarly found that the Home Office sometimes refuses refugee status to LGBTQI+ people who find it hard to speak about their sexual orientation.\u0026nbspThey told one person who they refused that their story was \u0027wholly lacking in compelling detail or any emotive terminology\u0027.\u0026nbspThis fails to recognise that in many parts of the world it is taboo to talk about emotions and relationships. People who do not conform to a society\u0027s gender norms may never have spoken about their sexuality or gender identity at all. European governments should stop basing decisions on whether to grant asylum to LGBTQI+ people based on a person’s ability to articulate a ‘coming out story’ in line with Western stereotypes”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So it gives the impression that there is more time to act.“Actions for both mitigation and adaptation of climate change needs to happen immediately. We cannot afford any more the business-as-usual approach for managing climate change.”\u0026nbspKarsten Haustein, of the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, said:\u0026nbsp“What this short but intense episode has shown is that the potential for 40C is there.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

president of Tanzania has inaugurated a huge controversial hydroelectric dam project in a wildlife reserve at the centre of warnings over rhino and elephant populations.Conservation groups have opposed the Stiegler’s Gorge project in the Selous Game Reserve, the country’s largest wildlife area, which Unesco says has one of the most significant concentrations of elephants and black rhinos.President John Magufuli called the project “the start of economic liberation”, saying the reserve – which is also a haven for cheetahs and giraffes – has been considered a potential energy source for decades.Only one in 10 households in in the East African nation has access to the national grid and electricity prices are high.“Beginning today, this will indicate that Tanzania is an independent country... and not a poor country,” Mr Magufuli said.Created with Sketch.Conservation success for the Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with

including the habitats of the site’s last remaining black rhinos.The dam would be 130 metres high and stretch 700 meters across the Stiegler Canyon at the Rufiji River, in a Unesco World Heritage Site that is one of Africa’s largest protected areas and relatively undisturbed by humans.The president said he hoped the project would boost industrial development.Hunting group ‘undermining protections for endangered animals’“It’s time to benefit from our national resources,” he said.Opponents of the project say it could also threaten the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people downstream, who depend on the river for agriculture and fisheries.Last month the IUCN, together with Unesco’s World Heritage Centre, called for an immediate halt to logging and other preparations, warning of “irreversible damage” if it went ahead.\u0026nbspAn independent review commissioned by IUCN highlighted the “inadequacy” of the environmental impact assessment.“It would cut the heart out of the Selous reserve, with catastrophic impacts on the site’s wildlife and habitats,” said Peter Shadie, of the IUCN’s World Heritage Programme.Magufuli\u0026nbsp(centre) at the ceremony with a 3D model of the projectAfter the inauguration, the Worldwide Fund for Nature said the game reserve was of “extraordinary importance” and urged Tanzania’s government to consider “less harmful energy alternatives”.But earlier this month, Mr Magufuli downplayed fears for the environment, saying that by providing energy, the dam would deter locals from felling trees for fuel.“I want to reassure everyone this project in fact aims to promote the environment,” Magufuli said, Business Day reported. \u0026nbsp“Also, it’s just a small part of the reserve – just 3 per cent of the total area.”The president said the dam would not only meet national electricity needs but would also provide power to export.Tanzanian president tells women to \u0027set ovaries free\u0027 and have babiesThe International Monetary Fund predicts the economy of Tanzania, will grow by 4 per cent this year, down from 6.6 per cent last year.The Elephant Protection Initiative said the fact that a leading wildlife country was “prepared to contemplate drowning their natural crown jewels in pursuit of megawatts must serve as a serious wake-up call to everyone in conservation”.“We need to make the case urgently that wildlife conservation can not only pay for itself, but that it is often the best way for the human populations who live around it to realise their legitimate aspirations for development and prosperity.“Destroying habitat may present the illusion of short-term economic gain, but in the long run is counterproductive, not just for wildlife of course, but also people and economies.”Additional reporting by the Associated PressOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In other words, both the No Deal preparation and the proposed deal must be realistic.This is where his key Brexit lieutenants Dominic Cummings and David Frost come in.They might be backroom appointments but they are as —not more — important to the success of Boris’s premiership as the Cabinet appointments he has made.Cummings is a unique figure in Westminster. He is interested in getting things done with little regard to what people think of him and the political niceties.It is thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch that Cummings has attracted something close to celebrity status in political circles. Cumberbatch played Cummings in the TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War.He captured brilliantly Cummings’ drive and determination to win as the campaign chief for Vote Leave, and the fact he doesn’t care whose ego he ruffles in the process.In his new job, Cummings’ determination is already clear.Yesterday he was meant to be on the operating table under general anaesthetic.But once the offer came from Boris, he cancelled the operation. I am told he won’t have it done now until after October , Boris’s deadline for getting Brexit done.Cummings came in because the chance of getting the Vote Leave team back together to deliver Brexit after three years of drt simply had to be taken. The big challenge for this team is to get the UK ready for a No Deal Brexit.Cummings is well suited to his task. He knows how Whitehall works and how to succeed despite intense opposition he drove through Michael Gove’s Free Schools, which have proved hugely successful, against the objections of the educational establishment.Strikingly, in Boris’s new Government it is now Gove who is in charge of the No Deal planning.Getting the logistics and the necessary contingency plans sorted is one aspect of No Deal planning, and one that was shamefully neglected under Mrs May. But there also needs to be a political strategy for it.Many in the EU are convinced — thanks to the antics of Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond and co — that Parliament will block No Deal.Or thatthe UK did leave without a deal on Halloween, it would come crawling back by Christmas.So they reckon there is no need to compromise as No Deal either won’t happen or will be only a temporary affair.The best way to deal with both the Parliamentary opposition to No Deal and the belief that the UK would come crawling back is for Boris to take a lead in the polls.If it was clear that a general election would lead to a majority for Boris, then Parliament would be less likely to throw obstacles in his way.That’s why Boris, in his Downing Street speech, tried to address the issues that cost the Tories their majority in : Social care, schools funding and police cuts.If the EU thought that Boris could do No Deal, and could politically sustain it, then it would have to decide whether it was prepared to compromise to avoid No Deal.The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would have to decide whether it is worth sticking with a backstop that is going to cause the very thing it was meant to avoid, a hard border on the island of Ireland.Varadkar would also have to consider whether he really wants to go through with No Deal when it would do more damage to the Irish economy than the UK’s. This is where David Frost comes in.No, not the late, great TV personality but the former Foreign Office diplomat who is going to be Boris’s point man for negotiations with the EU.Frost knows his way round the chancelleries of Europe, he is a former Foreign Office Europe Director and he also knows what Boris wants on Brexit.He was his special adviser when Boris was Foreign Secretary and was there when Boris decided to quit over Mrs May’s Chequers plan.His role is to craft a Brexit agreement that delivers what Boris thinks the UK needs AND one that has a chance of being accepted by the EUthe alternative is No Deal. This isn’t going to be easy, and it isn’t going to be done quickly.Those involved admit thatthe EU is going to blink, it will not be until the October EU Council at the earliest, which is just two weeks away from the October  deadline. As one of those working in the new No puts it: “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.”But after years in which the EU thought they had the measure of the British Prime Minister, we now have a team who might just have what it takes to pull Brexit back from the brink. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There, they can enrol in a course on gender studies and emerge in three years with a degree which will not help them one bit to get a decent job.And as a consequence they will be at least £, in debt. But they’ll have a piece of paper which will tell possible employers: “Look — I’ve been a total mug for three years. Gizza job!”The unemployment rate for students at Britain’s worst universities, such as East London and London South Bank, is around about double the national rate for young people.In other words, going to university worsened their chances of getting a job.That’s not what they were led to believe, is it. They were told a university degree would open doors for them. Not slam the doors shut in their spotty faces. And leave them with a whopping loan to pay off.Our young people have been conned for far too long.We have a new Prime Minister now. And I think it would be a good ideahe took a very close look at higher education. OK, he’s got Brexit to sort out first, fine. But by November , this should be his priority.We are misleading our young people. Far too many -year-olds go to university and end up mired in debt, with rotten degrees in stupid subjects. While all students have to scrimp and save to get through their three years.Here’s what I would doI were Education Secretary.End all tuition fees right now. Make university education absolutely free, and make sure those who go get decent living grants.How do we pay for that  Easy. Cut the number of people going to university by  per cent. Not everyone is academically minded. University should be only for those who are.Back when I went to uni only ten per cent of my peer group got in.But for the rest there were apprenticeships. Learning in the workplace. And those sorts of options should be considered not inferior to university, but absolutely equal. And the benefits stressed to the kids.Three years after leaving school a university kid will be earning nothing. If you’ve been on an apprenticeship for three years you’ll be earning a decent whack.We have over-stressed the importance and attraction of a college education to our young people, given them unrealistic expectations and made them pay through the nose for it. And at the same time we’ve devalued education by doing this.So there’s the challenge, Boris. Get on to the private sector and get some more apprenticeships up and running.And close down the awful former polytechnics charging a king’s ransom for a crap degree.ONE of the best things about BoJo becoming Prime Minister is that the perpetually screeching Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has vowed to leave the country.Brown loathes the white English working class.So it was always a mystery to me why she stayed in the country. Seeing as there are quite a lot of white, English, working-class people.Anyway, she vowed to get the hell outJohnson became PM.Trouble is, people say stuff like this but rarely act on it.I suggest we set up a crowdfunding page for her plane ticket and maybe throw in some extra money for en-route snacks and stuff.Off you go to Heathrow, Yazza.I MADE a list a few weeks ago about the  things I most dislike in the world.At No was Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.At No was Taylor Swt.And No was cats .So take a guess as to what new film I’m not going to be watching any time soon It’s my nightmare, all wrapped up in two hours.CARL BEECH made a series of outrageous claims of sexual abuse, torture and murder by members of the old Conservative establishment.This serial liar and fantasist will soon be sentenced for his crimes.The reason the police believed this madman is because they have been told they must. They are no longer allowed to employ common sense.In order to be politically correct they have had to shed all semblance of judgment.THE job of a bookshop, you would have thought, is to sell books.Trouble is, they are useless at it. They are politically biased and cater solely to a tiny minority of gibbering liberals.I’ve got a book out at the moment, called The Great Betrayal – The True Story Of Brexit. I’ve had complaints from people who want to read it that they can’t find it in bookshops.The bookshop staff say they thought there wouldn’t be any interest in it. But it was the No best-seller in the country and was No on Amazon worldwide. It’s pure political bias.If you want the book – go on Amazon.TOP prize in the “Most Rational and Measured Response to Boris Johnson Becoming Prime Minister” goes to – of course – .For this headline: “The Clown Is Crowned As The Country Burns In Hell.”Followed by , words of hysterical drivel.Brilliant. The Left really don’t like it when they don’t get their own way.Anyway, this is but the first example of BDS – Boris Derangement Syndrome. Don’t worry. Lots more of it to come.MAGIC grandpa has a cunning plan!The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced to the Press that he was going to “surprise Boris Johnson” by calling a vote of no confidence.Here’s a tip, you Jew-bothering, bearded c**kwomble.If you want something to be a surprise for someone, don’t tell every newspaper in the country.THE Islamist crackpots in Iran have hijacked two of our oil tankers. Causing a pretty grave crisis.But why isn’t the Royal Navy escorting British ships through the Strait of Hormuz, when we know the danger  Andthey’re not ready yet to do that, why did we impound an Iranian tanker three weeks ago, knowing there would be reprisals We have been naive and underprepared. I’m not sure anyone has noticed yet.Anyway, she immediately demonstrated her full-blooded support for democracy.She said evenpeople voted leave in a second referendum, she’d still ignore it.Swimsuit only likes democracy when people vote the way she wants. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Son John Beavan became the political editor of the Daily Mirror and went on to be made Baron Ardwick and an MEP. When John died in , one obituary described his mother as “the redoubtable Alderman Emily Beavan, a name still remembered and savoured in Manchester Labour circles”.    John Beavan had a son, Matthew Symonds – Carrie’s dad – after an affair. Matthew also became a newspaper man, and had an affair with lawyer Josephine McAfee. The result of this affair was Carrie, who went on to be educated at the £,-a-year Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith, West London. She now campaigns on the environment. Emily, born in , stood for ­election to Manchester City Council twice before finally being voted in to represent her ward for almost  years. She did not stop there, fighting for women’s rights and fair working conditions as Chairman of the National Women’s Co-operative Guild. Historian Professor Karen Hunt of Keele University says: “She was the kind of woman who’d be known in the local community and someone people would go to for advice. “Women like her who stood for the council acted as the bridge between the council and the community.    “They’d fight for things like new wash houses. I think anyone who found out she was their ancestor would be proud of that level of activism.” At a Co-operative Guild’s Jubilee Meeting in , Mrs Beavan stood against barriers to Anglo-Russian trade and accused the Government of attacking educational advantages won for workers’ children. She said: “As wives and mothers we are horried by the figures on maternal mortality and we are determined to do our utmost to end this national disgrace.” As the Second World War broke out Mrs Emily Beavan was appointed to Manchester City Council’s Food Control Committee. As it ended she was on the School Health Services sub-committee. By  and now Alderman Emily E Beavan JP had risen to be the chair of the same sub-committee. It is believed Emily died aged  in  – but her name and work live on. Locals  Tory PM are streets apart Women in inner city Manchester today may not have quite the same struggles as they did back in Emily Beavan’s day, but they still fear for their future with Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. On Emily Beavan Close, in Openshaw – named after Carrie Symonds’ great- grandmother – local residents are less than impressed with our new premiere.  Former youth leader and child protection worker Claire Stanorth, , says: “We are in for it now. He is one idiot. Emily Beavan would say, ‘Get him out!’”Claire, who has lived on the neat cul-de-sac for  years, believes Boris’s vow to deliver Brexit –deal or no deal – is wrong.“Prices will go sky high. We rely on disability benefits because of my husband. We can barely survive now,” she says.  “Boris doesn’t know what it feels like not to be able to put food on the table or buy your child a pair of shoes. “Politics changed the day Margaret Thatcher came to power. “Everyone turned dog eat dog, and not in my back yard. There is no sense of community any more.” Community was something for which Emily Beavan fought tooth and nail. Further down the close, Claire’s neighbour Christine Gee agrees that Emily Beavan would have fought for fairness and equality and tried to get the country back on an even keel. Shop worker Christine, , says: “God help us with Boris. There should’ve been another election. I worry about the future generation.  “It is our grandchildren and great-children who are going to cop for it. We should get the young kids into work. We need to give them something to do then we won’t have all these stolen cars and all sorts going on. “If they bring back apprenticeships and give them training then they end up with a job with prospects. “But there is nothing for them – the government doesn’t put any money into it. And thenthe young people have jobs and training then people like me could retire.” But it isn’t just the older residents of the close who are fearful of what the Johnson regime will mean for them. Mum of two Isabella Foks, , is originally from Poland and concerned about what Brexit will mean for her family. “Both my children were born here,” she says. “I am worried. We have been here for six years and my husband works as a welder. I don’t trust Boris Johnson. I’m afraid because we’ve made our home here and we want to stay.”  Le-long Labour voter Karen Ward, , wants to see Johnson improve the NHS. Carer Karen says: “The NHS is a shambles. You are talking a five-week wait to see the GP. Then when the appointment day comes, you get a phone call to say it has been cancelled. “I don’t understand why we ended up with Brexit. If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it – we were doing all right in the EU.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fell runner 83 finishes 18","story":"NewsFell runner, , finishes -mile mountain course  years after first attemptStormy weather and cramp meant farmer failed to finish course in  but now hes celebrated completing it in ShareCommentsBySamantha Yule:,  JUL NewsJoss Naylor, aka Iron Joss, has finally gone back and completed the mountain course he tried in  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A legendary fell runner has finally overcome the one challenge that had beaten him – almost six decades after cramp and terrible weather put paid to his first attempt.Joss Naylor – known as Iron Joss – was forced to retire from the gruelling Lake District Mountain Trial  years ago.

Danielle seems to have drawn a particularly unlucky card.    According to Bupa, leggings are typically a very good item of clothing to stave off sunburn.

Alfie Howard-Hughes is fuming that Colchester Royal Grammar School said his flowing hair goes against its code of conduct policy. But the -year-old has said it is a part of him, and is determined to turn up on his first day of school with his hair still in tact. The schoolboy has wanted to attend the school in Essex, since the age of six. He passed all his + exams with flying colours which secured his place. And Alfie hopes to be a quantum physicist and said he wanted to challenge the rules for other boys with longer hair. Itaposs never been a thing in my mind it has always been there. My hair is a part of me, he said.  I donapost just want to do it so I can keep my hair but I want to do it for other boys who have long hair. His mum, Katy Cox, , has called the policy ridiculous and accused the school of making carbon copies of the children. She said: Rules keep our children safe and thataposs important but some rules need to be challenged otherwise we would be living in a cave. I think itaposs really outdated, with the world how it is and how far equality has come.  They need to let children grow and be themselves, itaposs like theyaposre trying to create cardboard cut outs of each of the children. Alfie loves academics, to the point where he was upset that his school was not hard enough on him. He loves learning and we thought grammar school with children who have similar minds would be fantastic. Alfie did his exams in September and he received his glowing results in November before his place in the school was confirmed in March this year.  The schoolboy said: When my dad got the letter, he picked me up from school and I saw it and just starting crying. We were stood there crying with happiness. Alfieaposs father Gary , also went to CRGS as a pupil and thought the policy might have become more flexible. Katy said: His dad and his friends had jobs that he inspired to have and from the age of six he wanted to go to the same school. He has sacriced other clubs to do tutoring so he could be prepared. Itaposs all him he has led his education we have just back him.  His dad thought it was just something that had been in place for a while and that a bit of pressure that the policy would be looked at and reevaluated. But that didnapost happen and the parents became involved in a to-and-fro with the school over countless emails and letters. The parents said that the school told them itaposs not illegal and that the policy will stay. Katy said: Initially, I was told that they were preparing them for a professional environment which we challenged because his dad and his friends in big jobs said that their policies were about looking clean and tidy nothing about theof menaposs hair.  They then said it was untidy but they have girls in their college that are allowed to have long hair and they have female members of staff. Alfie is happy to wear his hair however they want, in a plait, in a bun or even in a hair net! He just doesnapost want his hair cut. His mum added: I think I remember watching other children screaming when they had their hair cut and I thought I would never do that to my child. I wanted to leave it up to him when andhe wanted his hair cut and that never came.

Instead he showed contempt for the Com­mons and the public by showboating when he should have been serious and blustering when he should have been straightforward. It is hardly surprising he is running from scrutiny when he has such a cavalier approach. He is recklessly driving us towards a no-deal Brexit without any care for the consequences. If we crash out it will put firms and farmers out of business, threaten medical supplies and force food bills to rise. Those who will suffer will not be the PM and his privileged friends but the towns and communities which can least afford it.

His Brexit strategy has nothing to do with what is best for the country and everything to do with heading off Nigel Farage.

Fran Drake, now , struggled with her size for much of her le after turning to comfort food when cruel school bullies nicknamed her aposFat Franapos. Over the years she tried a handful of diets, including the : diet, but none of them kept the pounds off for long and she was stuck around a size . So she decided just to accept her body, and before long her confidence grew dramatically. She said: If I couldnapost change myself physically, I was going to change myself mentally.    Just because youaposre not a size  doesnapost mean you canapost be happy in yourself. And in  – then a size  - she started dating Matt after they got talking at a Christmas party. Bagging myself a fit man really reinforced the idea that I could be happy in my own skin without losing any weight,” she said. I was never confident when it came to dating before I met Matt. I always ended up with men that didnapost appreciate me and I thought I didn’t deserve any better because of my weight.    “But the problem was that after settling into a happy relationship and feeling more confident in myself, I started to eat more and more. Though her relationship with Matt was great, Fran saw her diet go from bad to worse and on a typical day, she would eat , calories a day – almost double the NHS recommended daily amount for women of , cals. Discussing Mattaposs naturally athletic build, she said: On nights out people would whisper, aposSheaposs punchingapos - like I didnapost know that he was in much better shape than me already. Things reached an all time low when she was flicking through photos from the trip of a letime to Walt Disney World, Florida, in April , and was reduced to tears at realising just how overweight she had become. From there, Fran, of Bournemouth, Dorset, ditched her diet of Pop Tarts and cheese-laden pasta bakes, and before long the pounds began to melt away. Now, she has shed a mammoth  stone, slimming to a  stone size eight – and has even fulfilled her ambition of becoming a trainee firefighter.  She said: I convinced myself before jetting off to Florida that Iaposd lost enough weight to finally look good on holiday, when in reality Iaposd lost a few pounds and was still grossly overweight. Now Iaposm healthier than ever, Iaposm finally training with the fire brigade and doing something meaningful with my le for the first time in what feels like forever. Since childhood, Fran, who married carpenter Matt on May ,  at Kingston Maurward, an th century mansion house in Dorchester, Dorset, has battled with her weight. As a result, she was teased mercilessly at school, which left her confidence in shreds. She recalled: Children have a knack for snfing out your biggest insecurity and making you feel  times worse about it. Unfortunately, my weakness wasnapost too hard to spot - my weight - and from the age of , I was referred to as aposfat Franapos or aposFatty-escaapos. I grew up in a household where,something was going wrong, youaposd cheer yourself up with something hearty and filling, and thataposs how I got locked into a vicious cycle.    After leaving school and landing a job working in patient services for the NHS, Franfell into a cycle of yo-yo dieting. By , Fran found herself squeezing into a size  and tipping the scales at  stone. That April, she and Matt booked to go to Walt Disney World and, though she was still feeling relatively confident, she decided to try her hand at dieting once more ahead of the trip. I was still very much of the mindset that I was happy with how I looked but wanted to be a bit trimmer for Florida, she recalled. I gave the : diet another whirl and was thrilled to lose a few extra pounds. “I managed to drop a dress size down to a , and I was actually really happy. “Florida was amazing too – the trip of a letime.”  But Fran’s dream holiday soon became a nightmare when, back in the UK, she decided to leaf through the photos she had taken and was left shocked at how she looked. I donapost know what it was about those particular set of photos, but it suddenly dawned on me thatI didnapost change now, my weight was going to kill me, she said. It all finally hit me, and I decided to overhaul my lestyle there and then. Signing up to her local slimming group in April , Fran swapped the junk food she had been living on for fresh home-cooked meals, veggie casseroles and fruit salads. Losing over six stone in a year, she was able to fit into a svelte size  corset dress by the time her wedding day rolled round in May . Remembering her special day, she said: Looking back, I canapost imagine what I would have looked like walking down the aisle in a size  wedding dress.    I can look back through my wedding day photos and smile at the happy memories without any self-loathing. Throwing herself into exercise, Fran also began hitting the gym three times a week, having regular personal training sessions. To fuel her workouts, she upped her protein intake with supplement brand Bio-synergy. Able to do things she never thought possible, from training in the gym to going on country walks with Matt, Fran found herself wanting to put her newfound fitness to use.

Today the Tele looks back at some of those memorable days.DUNDEE UTD  SPURS Tuesday, August , Att: ,A Spurs side that boasted the likes of Argentine World Cup winners Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa, England’s Glenn Hoddle and the new strike partnership of Steve Archibald and Garth Crooks, were blown away by a United side that would reach the peak of its powers over the next few seasons.The Londoners started well and led through a Crooks goal as early as the th minute but, by the break, Billy Kirwood had levelled.After the interval, Jim McLean’s men stepped up a gear and goals from Graeme Payne, Derek Addison and Paul Sturrock gave them a handsome victory over a team that, within a year, would win a classic FA Cup Final against Manchester City.DUNDEE UTD  ASTON VILLA Sunday, August , Att: ,A year before that superb display against Spurs, United entertained Aston Villa, with striker Paul Sturrock once again to the fore.With United dominating from start to finish, “Luggy” bagged a hat-trick to send Ron Saunders’ outfit heading back south with their tails between their legs.If not too much was made about the victory, it was a sign the Tangerines were on the verge of big things and, within months, McLean’s team would secure the club’s first major honour in the shape of the League Cup.It’s also worth remembering, in just two years, Villa would be champions of England and, a year later, more than half the team that ran out at Tannadice would start their winning European Cup Final against Bayern Munich.DUNDEE UTD  EVERTON Tuesday, July , Att: ,.This game was a testimonial for long-serving Maurice Malpas, with his influential former coach Walter Smith bringing Everton to mark the occasion.If the English Premier League giants were already a sizeable draw, their signing of Paul Gascoigne, who would make his debut, brought extra attention that saw news as well as football media heading for Tannadice, although tragic events in Paris as a Concorde crashed, meant, ultimately, actual coverage of it was limited.As was often the case with Gazza, trouble was not far away. He had a first-half flare-up with Joachim Fernandez that saw the home trialist take such exception that boss Paul Sturrock took him off before he was sent off.Malpas’ big night was marked with a win, David Weir giving the visitors the lead before two goals in three second-half minutes from Steven Thompson and Alex Mathie turned things round.DUNDEE UNITED  BARCELONA Saturday, July , Att: ,For the second year running, the Catalan giants had used United’s St Andrews University training base for the first week of their pre-season build-up and that meant fans were treated to a second summer friendly in a row against them at Tannadice.A year earlier, minus Lionel Messi because he was still on holiday, Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry were the stars as a last-gasp goal by the French great gave them victory.With Messi starting, the  friendly saw the Spaniards really turn up as they blasted five past the Tangerines .For once, though, such a reversal was surely acceptable, such was the quality of the opposition and just the sight of one of the world’s greatest players in action meant everyone went home happy.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

Unfortunately - for all concerned - fears have been realised.A trans woman, Jessica Yaniv, approached a number of female beauticians to ask for a Brazilian bikini wax, all - perhaps by coincidence - were lone home workers, the majority of whom were immigrant women.Unfortunately, Ms Yaniv was unable to find any beautician willing to carry out the intimate wax because she still retains male genitalia and each of these women only worked on female genitalia.:Are you trans  Next Scottish census to ask questions on gender IDMs Yaniv, a trans rights campaigner, then raised action against  of the women at British Columbiarsquos human rights tribunal, alleging discrimination and seeking damages of several thousanddollars from each.It was too much for several of the women to fight and so they folded their businesses instead, losing their livelihoods.The case cleaves opinion in two: either it is discriminatory of the beauticians to refuse to wax a trans womans genitals regardless of what they look like, or it is discriminatory to force a woman to handle male genitals against her will.The tribunal will make a decision - and that decision may well be to disregard womens boundaries and dignity by finding for Ms Yaniv and asserting that the law believes it is discrimination for women to refuse to touch a penis when that penis belongs to a trans woman.Ms Yaniv has posted deeply troubling comments on social media about young girls, although she claimed at the tribunal her account was hacked. There are those who would say she is vexatious and should be disregarded. Fiona Robertson, the SNPs National Womens and Equalities Convener, says Ms Yaniv is a female predator and that women predators often use their womanliness to gain access to victims.Critics of Ms Robertsons stance would strongly dispute male predatory behaviour being attributed to women.I would not dream of speaking for trans people but Im going to take a stab that the vast majority just want to get on with their lives peaceably and,asked about the Yaniv case, would be of the \"not in my name\" persuasion. Trans people cannot want this sort of legal action either, yet activists and allies have remained silent on the case.However, it cant be ignored and certainly not by a Scotland where there is a bitter ide between trans allies and, for want of a better shorthand, womens allies.Trans woman are women has become a political slogan in support of self ID and of respecting the rights of trans people but to take it to its conclusion is to fundamentally redefine the word \"woman\" and remove the element of sex from the words definition.The argument from some feminists is that the introduction of self ID is the beginning of a creep towards removing womens sex-based rights.Currently \"sex\" is a protected characteristic and so, for example, womens refuges have the right to refuse to house male-bodied people or, indeed, employ male-bodied people.Jo Swinson, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, has been highly vocal in declaring that trans women are women but less clear in defining exactly what she means. If it is the Liberal Democrats stance that trans women are literally women then it suggests the Liberal Democrats would support the removal of the sex-based exemption.To avoid Yaniv-style legal cases, the Scottish Government must be explicit in how the Equality Act will apply to any new law.But explicit answers to troubling questions are exactly what this public conversation is lacking and no wonder when you have an MP, Mhairi Black, calling women who disagree with self ID \"Jeremy Hunts\", a rhyming slang it takes no genius to work out.The Scottish Government already confuses \"sex\" with \"gender\" in its consultation on self ID. Pro-self ID campaigners have pointed to the reassurance that there will be the protection of up to two years prison term for those who abuse self ID. Butyou cannot define \"woman\", how can you legislate effectively to determine who is or isnt really living as a woman : years of Stonewall: The fight for LGBT rightsIn Canada too, a woman has reported to the human rights tribunal that a womans shelter for recovering addicts made her homeless because she refused to share a twin room with a trans woman. The woman was a rape victim and felt frightened at being in close quarters with a male-bodied person who was \"masc presenting\", that is, maintained a beard and wore typically masculine clothes.There was no suitable alternative space in the refuge and so the woman was asked to leave. This is another scenario women have raised questions about but been given no clear answers.Scottish Womens Aid and Rape Crisis have both made statements saying they are in support of self ID. Rape Crisis also supports men so its no surprise the charity supports trans people - it would be an odd developmentthey did not.Scottish Womens Aid, the umbrella organisation for womens aid groups in Scotland, focuses on policy and research, it does not run refuges and so, while it supports self ID and takes a clear line that domestic abuse affects trans women too, its position is largely academic in that it will not have to deal with the frontline practicalities of balancing rights.Inidual womens aid charities in Scotland have gone on public record to say they have real concerns about self-ID.Wouldnt it be useful, instead of sloganeering and calling women c****, for politicians and charities to give explicit, detailed answers to questions being asked  The only way to allay fears is to tackle them head-on.Women are told their boundaries are not under threat - the Yaniv case contradicts this. They are told there is no conflict when it comes to women-only spaces such as refuges, they are told men will not pose as trans women to gain access to womens spaces - there are multiple cases in Canada of this happening.It will only help the debate to progressquestions raised in Canada are answered in Scotland - for the benefit of everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-bell-st-finan-s-isle","story":"But the bell of St Finanrsquos Isle has indeed been taken, sparking a police investigation.So is it tolling now What is the signicance of the bell The bronze hand bell is said to date to medieval times and to have belonged to St Finan, who resided on the island known as Eilean Fhianain or St Finanrsquos Isle - or locally as the Green Isle - in Loch Shiel, near Glenfinnan, in Lochaber.Itrsquos a bell so ancient, its value is hard to contextualise, but historians treasure its religious and cultural signicance.Who was St Finan He was an Irishman who followed in the footsteps of Saint Columba, travelling from Ireland via Iona to the loch where he built a cell on the isle and used it as a base to spread the Christian faith to Lochaber and beyond.What remains on the isle A roofless chapel with an altar, upon which the bell sat, while gravestones and crosses signy the use of the isle as a Christian burial ground through the ages.It is still a place of pilgrimage and religious services are still held there.What was the bell used for During religious services and until the turn of the th century, it is said that the bell was brought down to the landing stage when a funeral party arrived and rung out as the procession wound their way up to the graveyard.How did the theft come to light One of the staff members of Loch Shiel Cruises spotted it was missing. The theft is thought to have happened sometime over the last month. And it is believed the thief would have required heavy bolt cutters as a previous flimsy chain was replaced with a hand-forged bronze chain two years ago, suggesting the incident was planned.Locals are shocked Rosie Frampton Monsef, of Loch Shiel Cruises, said simply: ldquoItrsquos a tragedy. The bell is of massive signicance here, and lots of people go to the island as a pilgrimage. Parishes have services there. Itrsquos still a very holy isle.Whatrsquos Harry Potter got to do with it Some headlines have referred to the boy wizard because Loch Shiel features as the Black Lake in the Harry Potter movies and the isle is by Glenfinnan, where filming for the second and third Harry Potter movies took place, with Glenfinnan Viaduct making a star appearance on the silver screen.How signicant is the loss of the bell Scottish culture and heritage historian Professor Hugh Cheape described it as a ldquohorrible catastrophe, adding: ldquoI have thought a lot about St Finan over the years and how he took on leprosy as a penance.\"He would have sailed up Loch Shiel with only his hand bell and a staff as the early Christian saints did. I canrsquot put myself in the mind of someone who would take it.The bell is cursed Mr Cheape has warned the culprit could indeed be in danger. He said of the bell: ldquoItrsquos known to be cursed. One of the Government soldiers after the  rebellion went off with it to Fort William, where the bell turned round, beat him up then flew back to St Finanrsquos isle with the villagers hearing it clanking through the air.Police inquiries are ongoing.A Police Scotland spokesman said: \"The bell was removed from the uninhabited island sometime between late June and early July. Anyone with information about the theft or the whereabouts of the bell is asked to call , quoting incident  of July , or call Crimestoppers anonymously on   .\""},{"url":null,"title":"funding-regions-39-transparent-39","story":"The Barnett Formula is currently used by the Treasury to calculate annual funding from the UK Treasury for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Baseline levels of funding for the regions were determined more than  years ago.However, a new report by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee says that the Treasury does not know to what extent funding is meeting the needs of the populations, and described the current arrangements as \"not explained in a way that is readily understandable to taxpayers\".The report also points out that funding arrangements are becoming more complicated as tax and social security powers are further devolved to the regional administrations.It has called for greater transparency about how funding decisions are made.: Fraser of Allander rubbishes Westminster bailout claimThe report also raised concerns at the uncertainty for devolved administrations caused by the postponement of the Spending Review ahead of the UKs departure from the EU, and the absence of a decision on how it will replace existing EU funding.Under current funding arrangements, when there are changes to government plans to increase spending in England for services and activities which are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland such as policing, additional funding is allocated to those regions, known as Barnett consequentials.Ministers can also allocate funding directly to the regions, such as funding to Scotland to meet the policing costs associated with US President Donald Trumps visit, and funding allocated to Northern Ireland as part of the confidence and supply deal between the Conservative Party and the DUP.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

Five months on, with no progress having been made, I want to challenge Mr Kerr to put his country and his constituency above party and back another referendum on Brexit. In the  referendum,  per cent of voters in Stirling backed Remain, higher than the  per cent figure in Scotland as a whole. Despite this, Mr Kerr’s team told me he would continue to facilitate Brexit. They argued that in  he was elected on a Conservative party manesto that promised to “respect the referendum”. I understand this.Yet, circumstances have changed. With any form of ‘sensible’ Brexit deal being blown out the water, it looks like the Conservative party is going to attempt to enforce the hardest possible Brexit upon Remain-voting Stirling. I am sure Mr Kerr has seen the recent YouGov survey revealing that Conservative members are willing to endure the collapse of the party itself, an economic crash and even the break-up of the UK in order to secure Brexit.: Brexit fears for sterling spark sharp warning to traders: Why it looks like Boris Johnson is planning to destroy Brexit Party – John McLellanI now find myself asking, where are the Scottish Conservatives in all of this  Are they happy to sit back and witness this collective loss of rationality and support the ‘Brexit-at-any-cost’ mentality that has gripped both their party and large parts of the UK This kamikaze approach would perhaps be understandablethe end result was something worth having. Yet a no-deal Brexit, which appears to be all but government policy, would be devastating for Scottish industry. For example, the drinks giant Diageo has already announced shts of production out of Scotland to the EU. This month, Deutsche Bank announced it is cutting jobs across the UK, having previously said it would move assets from London to Frankfurt because of Brexit. And the Scottish National Farmers Union has just raised serious concerns on behalf of its members about how lower food safety standards could put farmers livelihoods at risk. Is this what Stephen Kerr and the Scottish Conservatives would be happy to sacrice Finally, and most importantly for the Conservative and Unionist Party, polls in recent weeks highlighted that Scots would vote for independenceBoris Johnson became the next UK Prime Minister. With Tuesday’s announcement rendering this horror story a reality, an independent Scotland appears increasingly likely. Scots will not accept a botched deal by Boris or a cataclysmal no-deal Brexit. The Scottish Conservatives are very proud to call themselves the unionist party of Scotland. Surely, they are not so committed to any form of Brexit that they will put their party’s raison d’être in existential danger I understand Mr Kerr’s hesitancy about any form of a People’s Vote or confirmatory referendum as he feels he was elected on a manesto that promised not to offer this.However, I cannot understand how on Earth the Scottish Conservatives can continue to facilitate a disastrous Brexit that will be hugely damaging to Scotland’s economy and risks breaking up the union they are so proud of. Therefore, I ask, on behalf of young people in Scotland, who voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, to at the very least publicly state your opposition to a destructive no-deal Brexit.Ailie Ross-Oliver is a campaigner with the Our Future Our Choice group©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"letters why does nicola sturgeon refuse to respect the 2014 indyref vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scots made a decision on independence in , why does Nicola Sturgeon not respect the vote result, a Scotsman reader writes.In her letter to Boris Johnson, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says: “The right of the people of Scotland to determine their own future is a basic democratic principle that must be respected.” : Nicola Sturgeon writes to Boris Johnson: ‘We will give Scotland independence choice’For unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here\u2028The people exercised this right in  and determined that we should stay within the United Kingdom.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer.Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.One person treated by emergency services after dramatic Lough Neagh rescue - jet ski not seen for more than two hours Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"“Hopefully we will see their numbers increase and get a sustainable population, with four or five pairs regularly breeding, and this feels more achievable after this landmark year. Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes. If you plant them they grow early in the season and that encourages the birds to come in.“I’m sure some volunteers will spend a day digging nettles on a wintry day and think ‘What’s this all about ’ But when you stand here now on a summer’s day and think there’s a bird that’s globally threatened and you have helped to save it by just going out and digging up some nettle rhizomes, well you know most of the people involved will be absolutely delighted at the results.”Farmer Richard Green is delighted to have been hearing the corncrake’s call - on the second corncrake site - over the last few years.He said: “For me, it started four years ago when we had a corncrake calling right through the summer.“To hear that this year there are two pairs, one of which is on our land, is great. It shows us we must be doing something right for them. The way we farm, we’re sensitive to nature and the birds and we try to do whatever we can to help.”After the second brood hatches later this month, the birds will migrate back to Africa in August or September.Corncrakes are easily spooked, so members of the public are asked not to try and get close to the birdsthey hear their call as they are on private land and it is also important that the birds are not disturbed and that this sensitive conservation effort is not compromised.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1985871.jpg--.jpg?1563356127000\n","title":"council to honour ww2 veterans with silver poppy gift","story":"WHILE urging Mid  East Antrim Council to honour the last surviving veterans of World War , DUP councillor John Carson reflected on the cost of that global conflict to one local family.Proposing a motion that each surviving veteran in the area - from across the services and the merchant navy - should receive a silver Poppy of Remembrance in November, Alderman Carson said it was also fitting to remember those who had made the supreme sacrice especially with the th anniversary of the outbreak of war looming.

Following its refurbishment, the church has become a hive of community activity and will welcome former Clannad musician Moya Brennan for a highly anticipated concert on August .The County Donegal performer has just released a new album, Timeless, and will play a number of shows throughout the country in the coming months, but luckily she was able to be booked for the Greater New Lodge Community Festival through a mutual interest with Abundant Grace Pastor Sharon Perry.“I serve on the board of a Christian charity with Moya Brennan and I happened to ask hershe would be available,” Sharon explained.“She wasn’t free the night we were supposed to be having it, so we change the date and she was very willing to come along.“It’s a great opportunity for the local community to see such a well-known performer. I think it’s something that doesn’t come along often so close to home. You might see an advert for one of the concert halls in Belfast for Moya, but to have it on our own doorstep here is brilliant. Moya is a lovely lady with a beautul ministry of music.”As well as providing a fantastic night of entertainment, all proceeds from the concert will go to to Special Olympics Ireland.“We ourselves as a charity try to make ends meet to get the work done that is in our hearts to do,” Sharon stated.“We try to help other charities where we can, so we thought this was an opportunity to help kids with learning disabilities. There are lots of activities there for them to be stimulated through sport.”Looking forward to the gig, Sharon said: “We have Zephaniah Dancers coming as well, who are an Irish dance group based in Portadown. They’ll be the support act. The strange thing is that they’re really excited about coming as well because they have actually choreographed a dance to one of Moya’s songs and had got permission to perform it in dferent places. The fact that the girls are now coming together with Moya is amazing.“There will be a mixture of secular music, Gaelic songs and a few Christian songs in the mix as well.”She continued: “I hope people take the opportunity because the chance doesn’t come along often to see Moya Brennan for £.

At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled. It is also impacting on the ability of parties to restore the political institutions here. He now needs to demonstrate his ability to act with sensitivity and impartiality in his engagements with local parties.“It#s time to cut the bluff, bluster and bombastic rhetoric and start to provide the kind of reassurance business and civic society needs. Whilst I remain sceptical he will do that, I wish him well and will be more than happy to be proved wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":null,"title":"bbc northern ireland to be represented at belfast pride not appropriate says jim allister","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is aware that they have been well rehearsed. He’s aware that this process of talks and negotiations has, to use his term, ebbed and flowed.“He’s also aware that it needs to pick up momentum, that it can’t go on forever.“He has committed that he will deal with all of the parties on the basis of equality and impartiality.”Mrs McDonald said she also challenged him on the DUP’s confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives.“We have said to him very clearly that that relationship has poisoned the water here and has conspired to keep the institutions down,” she added.“I think his commitment to deal even-handedly will be tested in the coming weeks. We don’t need a ‘yes’ man.”Good meeting with new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland @JulianSmithUK.

He can’t sit there and ponticate about what his next move is,” he added.He called for the new Secretary of State to ramp up the talks process and give clear structure.“He needs to give us a direction of travel, which we have been sadly lacking over the last few months and weeks,” he continued.“We made it absolutely clear to him that no matter what his relationship is with the DUP, he cannot be a sop to their tantrums and cannot be meek and mild in front of Sinn Fein’s intransigence. He needs to bang their hands together.”Mr Beattie added: “What he cannot do is ignore the smaller parties and think he’s going to bounce us at the very end of this process and expect us to jump in.“There is an issue of governance and an issue of transparency, and we want to see those addressed properly.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Julian Smith on the Double Bastion of the city walls in Londonderry “As Secretary of State he needs to be proactive and,he is not, he will fall in exactly the same way as the last Secretary of State fell.”In the first meeting between Irish and British government ministers since Boris Johnson’s appointment as Prime Minister, Ireland’s deputy premier Simon Coveney said he stressed the need to restore Stormont.Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party laid bare the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland, both politically and socially. She said: “We set out for him very clearly how we see things in Northern Ireland, the importance of getting an Executive restored, the dficulty of doing that in the context of Brexit and now the rumours of a general election.“We made it clear that Theresa May finally realised that was not a prospect which would work in terms of Northern Ireland and we now need him to be stressing that reality to the Prime Minister.”SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said: “We had one simple but important question – is he going to be part of the solution or is he going to be part of the problem ”She claimed there is “widespread concern” that he was given the position to be Mr Johnson’s “yes man” to the DUP.“The DUP’s world view of the situation in the North is not an accurate one and we made that crystal clear to him,” she added. “We pressed on him the importance of engaging with people in communities right across the North to get an understanding of the situation.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Republic’s premier added.He said it would be “provocative” for the Irish Government to take steps towards engineering a united Ireland now and the country simply wants to maintain the status quo.Mr Varadkar said: “Certainly in the event of a no-deal more and more people in Northern Ireland will begin to question the union.“People who you might describe as moderate nationalists or moderate Catholics, who were more or less happy with the status quo, will look more towards a united Ireland.“And we will increasingly see liberal Protestants and liberal unionists starting to ask the question as to where they feel more at home.“Is it in a nationalist Britain that is talking about potentially reintroducing the death penalty or something like that or is it part of a European home and part of Ireland ”Ireland has urged the UK to raty the draft Withdrawal Agreement with the EU, which led to Theresa May’s fall from power.It supports the backstop insurance policy intended to prevent a hard Irish border and keeping the UK’s trade regulations aligned with the EU’s.Unionists fear that would threaten the integrity of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, while Brexiteers believe it could prevent the UK from striking trade deals with other countries.The Taoiseach has arrived at the MacGill summer school in Co Donegal. pic eDlDzYLxD— michael mchughJuly , Mr Varadkar was speaking as he addressed the MacGill summer school in Glenties, Co Donegal.He said: “One of the things that ironically could really undermine the union of the UK is a hard Brexit, both for Northern Ireland and for Scotland, and that is a problem they are going to have to face.”He reiterated the Irish Government is making no preparations for unity now, a key demand of Sinn Fein, since it believes that would be provocative to unionists.The Taoiseach added Ireland’s negotiating aim for Brexit is to maintain the status quo on issues like cross-border trade.The country is not using the issue to leverage constitutional change in Northern Ireland, he said.“If there is a hard Brexit on the st of October,the UK takes Northern Ireland out of the EU against the wishes of the majority of people of Northern Ireland and takes away their European citizenship and undermines the Good Friday Agreement in doing so, those conditions will arise whether we like it or not.”"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands of

Our tourism offer in the region is steadily growing and this new £m investment by Holiday Inn adds another great hotel to our growing list and provides more choice for visitors.“The creation of  new jobs in the process is a great boost for the city, not to mention the wider benefits that will be felt in the local supply chain.”"},{"url":null,"title":"fort george potential must maximised mccallion","story":"Sinn Féin has told a government department involved in the development of the Fort George site that it must be maximised for the benefit of the city and region.A party delegation led by MP Elisha McCallion and including Foyle Assembly members Karen Mullan and Raymond McCartney met the Department for Communities regarding plans to construct a health hub on the site.Elisha McCallion commented: “We made it clear that all options for Fort George must be fully considered, because while we are fully supportive of the proposal to create a health hub in the city, we are not convinced that Fort George is the most appropriate site for it.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“The health hub could be built on any number of sites locally.

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors. The garden party lasts from pm to pm, with an entrance fee of pound..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Businesses boost for Downpatrick  ","story":"A NEW group has been formed to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street in Downpatrick.Senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials met last week with traders and politicians to discuss how to spend the money on business improvements at a part of a town where work on a protracted pound, public realm scheme was completed at the end of June.The revitalisation funding is being provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help Irish Street business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward was formed at last weekrsquos meeting with the news that funding is being made available welcomed by Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon.Cllr Curran hopes that traders will come up with schemes to improve shop fronts and is hoping they will seek professional help in order that any planning applications which may have to be lodged are approved.ldquoIrish Street traders were put through the mill during work on a public realm scheme which lasted six months instead of three, he said.ldquoNow that the work has been completed, apart from a promised resurfacing project, it is time businesses at this part of Downpatrick are allowed to get on with the job of meeting the needs of a wide range of customers.Cllr Curran has promised to provide the new working group with all help and support and hopes that all Irish Street businesses will get involved in the revitalisation scheme.He also highlighted the importance of retaining the character of this part of the town and said this is something that the business community is acutely aware of.Cllr Curran said given plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings, much focus will be on Irish Street.It emerged last week that work to secure all the necessary land required to advance the project may not be purchased until the end of the year.While the former police base has already been purchased, there are a number of adjacent buildings and pockets of land which need to be bought.The old police station enjoys protected status and will remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project which in addition to new retail and commercial space, could also include an element of housing provision.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are driving the regeneration project, with suggestions that the old police station could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.Council officials are determined to deliver the major scheme and are excited at the development potential the Irish Street site offers and want to maximise its potential.Once the ious land and buildings have been acquired, a development brief will be compiled and sent out to seek expressions of interest from the private and commercial sectors.Cllr Curran added: ldquoI hope we reach this stage in the process soon and that once expressions of interest come in, the Downpatrick business community will be briefed and asked for its input.

The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals. Even burning his hand while working on his car failed to dampen Tonerrsquos day.Camillus Bradley and Crawford Henderson claimed second in the category after early second-placed holder Wesley Patterson went out with a broken crown wheel and pinion.Round five of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Rally Championship will see a switch from tarmac to gravel as crews head to Co Fermanagh in September for the Lakeland Stages Rally.The series is beginning to heat up and a three-way fight for the crown is developing between Derek McGeehan, Derek McGarrity and Stephen Wright.

Eoghan Cassidy edged the home side in front with a super effort from out on the left wing, only to see McCrickard level once more from a similar type angled dead ball score.Derry had spurned an opportunity of snatching the game when the Down rearguard pressurised Seaacuten Kelly into shooting wide.Fom the resulting puck-out a tussle for possession saw Niall Fitzsimmons flash the sliotar over the Derry crossbar.When the whistle finally blew five minutes over the , it was Down who had progressed to Semple Stadium.Down: C McAlornan, E Kelly, T Murray, A Dorrian, C Smith, R McCrickard, N McFarlane , N Fitzsimmons , P Savage, J Hanrahan, R Blair , T Prenter , R Costello , C McCrickard , S Martin .

How on earth can theyensure their impartialitythey are taking part in a parade which is endorsing both gay marriage and what they call ‘women’s reproductive rights’.”He continued: “These issues are political and highly contentious — regardless of where you stand on this issue, everyone accepts that they are highly contentious.”Mr Wellsadded: “If you have a situation where employees are taking part in a private capacity is one thing that you can’t do anything about, but what is being proposed here is a full endorsement by inidual programmes.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “The BBC is emphatically, unequivocally, unapologetically, on the side of the political debate represented by the LGBT community.“The BBC is very clearly declaring what its values are on this issue.”A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We’re proud to be a erse and inclusive organisation.“BBC Pride is a UK-wide initiative run independently by staff which brings together people of all sexualities working with the BBC, offering friendship, support, advice and a range of events.

He needs to bang their hands together.”Mr Beattie added: “What he cannot do is ignore the smaller parties and think he’s going to bounce us at the very end of this process and expect us to jump in.“There is an issue of governance and an issue of transparency, and we want to see those addressed properly.“As Secretary of State he needs to be proactive and,he is not, he will fall in exactly the same way as the last Secretary of State fell.”Sinn Fein also held a meeting with Mr Smith which lasted about an hour.Speaking afterwards, Mary Lou McDonald said: “We have stepped through all of the issues with him and obviously the outstanding rights issues and the issues that need to be resolved to ensure that the institutions can be restored, and that, crucially, we can deliver inclusive, sustainable and good government for every citizen living in this part of Ireland.“He is aware of the issues, he is aware that they have been well rehearsed.

Only he can answer the question as to why he is doing that..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “From a Brexit negotiating perspective, it was a bad day yesterday and we will have to wait and seethat message coming from London changes in the weeks ahead.”But Mr Smith said: “I think we need to find solutions, particularly for the issue of the border, but the Prime Minister was very, very clear to his Cabinet yesterday that he wants to get a deal done.“But we do need to have structured conversations with the EU and I think they are open to doing that, I had a very, very good conversation with Simon today.”Earlier on Friday, Mr Smith separately met the five main parties at Stormont. He said he hopes they can meet again next week to get talks on restoring powersharing moving.“We have got to get these talks up and running, it has been going on far too long,” he said.“I had hoped for a holiday but I am going to be making sure that I push as hard as I possibly can to get these talks going because there are a whole range of issues that need resolving, the biggest issue is to make sure that public services and basic important decisions are made for every citizen in Northern Ireland.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party laid bare to Mr Smith the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland, both politically and socially. SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said: “We had one simple but important question – is he going to be part of the solution or is he going to be part of the problem ”Five main NI parties meet with

The space was sad and neglected before and now is interesting, welcoming and inviting truly a space for all our learners to explore their senses.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
