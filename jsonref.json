[{"url":null,"title":"Banksy offers help buy HMP Reading Oscar Wilde held turn arts centre","story":"Share this article Earlier this year, Banksy created his work \u0027Create Escape\u0027 on the wall of the prison which is thought to be a nod to the fact it once housed Wilde.The artwork, on the red brick wall of the former Reading Prison, showed an inmate escaping lockdown using a knotted spool of paper from a typewriter.It appeared on March 1 and was officially confirmed as a Banksy on March 4, when the elusive artist posted a video on his Instagram account. The video is set to archive commentary from an episode of The Joy Of Painting with Bob Ross.It shows Banksy picking up and carrying a ladder, then picking out spray cans, in the dark.Banksy places a stencil for the piece - which he now intends to sell - over the wall of Reading Prison and sprays it with paint.Although the site closed to prisoners in 2013, its future has been the focus of fierce debate ever since.The campaign to turn the site into an arts hub has won the support of Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Sir Kenneth Branagh, Natalie Dormer and Kate Winslet.Other notable former inmates include heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua who was remanded there as a teenager in 2009 and the Victorian serial killer Amelia Dyer who was said to have murdered up to 400 babies.The jail was built on the site of the medieval Reading Abbey, a monastery founded by Henry I - son of William the Conqueror.Henry is believed to have been buried under the altar, now thought to be under the prison car park or walls.Matt Rodda, Labour MP for Reading East, said the concept of using the prison to house arts has been proved by past exhibitions and he planned to raise an urgent question in Parliament this week to put ministers \u0027on the spot\u0027 with the offer.He added: \u0027There are these amazing layers of history - there\u0027s the literary history and the LGBT community history, and the link to Oscar Wilde. But there\u0027s also some local and national Victorian social history and there\u0027s the link to the Royal Family all in one building and it\u0027s so well connected to the rest of country.\u0027For so many reasons it\u0027s absolutely right this building is preserved and used in a constructive way rather that just being gutted and turned into flats or some other thing.\u0027Jason Brock, Reading Borough Council leader, said: \u0027We very much welcome the attention that Banksy\u0027s interest in Reading Gaol has placed on both the MoJ\u0027s (Ministry of Justice\u0027s) sale of the vacant prison and on the council\u0027s ambition to transform it into an hub of arts, heritage and culture of local and national significance.\u0027The council has had only informal approaches from representatives of Banksy to date, but no detailed discussions.\u0027Our bid remains firmly on the table and has widespread support - both from within the community here in Reading and from the wider arts, heritage and cultural community - all of whom recognise the prison\u0027s huge historical and cultural value.\u0027The MoJ said: \u0027The deadline for bids has passed and we are currently considering the ones we received.\u0027 Banksy sketches out £10m plan to free Oscar Wilde’s prison from developers | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Dominic Raab tells public Christmas parties social interaction","story":"Share this article        Describing the approach as \u0027balanced and proportionate\u0027, he added that vaccines would still provide the \u0027best protection\u0027.Christmas markets, events and bookings for the festive season are worth a staggering £12billion to the British economy, MailOnline revealed last night.Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to keep the economy open despite concerns over Omicron could be worth £1.1billion to the Christmas markets and winter wonderland industry and more than £10billion to hospitality.Thousands of Christmas parties up and down the UK are being cancelled amid conflicting advice from ministers over the new variant -

I think the best case is it\u0027s equivalent in severity to Delta... but you\u0027ll see milder symptoms now, than Delta when it emerged, because many more people have immunity now.\u0027A pre-print published yesterday suggested Omicron was around three times more likely to re-infect people who had had Covid before.South African researchers said there had been 35,670 reinfections since the beginning of the pandemic, and the risk of reinfection was 0.7 per cent during the country\u0027s Beta-fuelled second wave last winter and Delta wave in the summer.But the risk of catching the virus again has recently spiralled to at least 2.4.Scientists from Stellenbosch University, near Cape Town, said the findings suggested Omicron was better able to evade immunity in people who had already been infected than other variants which were suppressed by immunity.A pre-print paper means it has not yet been reviewed by other scientists, who double-check its findings.Microbiologist at Reading University Dr Simon Clarke said the data was the \u0027first indication\u0027 that Omicron could get around immunity from previous Covid infection. He said: \u0027There are a few caveats in this work, such as not having definitively confirmed that it was indeed Omicron that was causing the reinfection, but they were able to determine that the increased transmission of Beta or Delta variants was not a result of immune evasion. \u0027There is no indication as to how this immune evasion happens, although it can be presumed to be because of decreased antibody binding to Omicron\u0027s mutated spike protein.\u0027He added: \u0027Omicron has blown a big hole in the controversial argument that we should simply allow the infection to spread in an attempt to create immunity. \u0027Herd immunity which now seems like nothing more than a pipe dream. We await a further indication as to whether Omicron has any ability to evade vaccine induced immunity.\u0027Infectious diseases expert at the University of East Anglia Professor Paul Hunter said: \u0027The implications of this paper are that Omicron will be able to overcome natural and probably vaccine induced immunity to a significant degree. \u0027But, the degree is still unclear though it is doubtful that this will represent complete escape.\u0027He added: \u0027It remains the case that the extra value of the booster vaccination dose remains the most important step that we can take to reduce the probability of severe disease. \u0027I suspect new targeted vaccinations will be developed against omicron but it the infection spreads globally as rapidly as it seems to be taking off in South Africa then most of us may already have had the infection by the time a new vaccine is available.\u0027 The variant has been spotted in more than 30 countries worldwide and is likely to have been spreading for weeks before South Africa raised the alarm. The Netherlands detected a case one week earlier, while Nigeria found its first case in a sample taken in October. ¿Enforce jabs, not lockdowns¿- Strong resistance likely to any new lockdown measures over OmicronWill the omicron Covid variant wreck Christmas?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56dc7d9d8c4e1fe72d901122c1874505326ec95d/0_114_3267_1961/master/3267.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=20025f4d3a5b5676e9f09b0599c0a976","title":"mexico celebrated through the eyes of designers in pictures","story":"“The book gathers illustrations and prints that represent ‘what is Mexican’,” says its author, Mercurio López Casillas. “They are recreations of a heavenly and colourful idealised Mexico, inhabited by people who are always happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f272589bb907cb90467a133e557cc6b0f5b63314/0_118_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5f273b036cf9e8be6d56d525dd779c3e","title":"saudi arabian grand prix f1 live","story":"“We said OK, we’ll give the place up and we informed race control.” “It’s weird, it looks like Lewis has lifted off, it’s like he didn’t want to pass him there because of the DRS ... we picked up quite a bit of damage with that. It’s very frustrating and very annoying. “It was a shame with the quali, yesterday, not to get the pole but Max was able to address that and get the lead.”Meanwhile, Verstappen again, on the contact with Hamilton: “I was just down-shifting and braking for him to go by ... I looked in the mirror and waited for him to pass ... maybe there was some confusion ... I was already off the racing line, I don’t know ... maybe he was looking for the DRS, they told me on the radio to let him by, so that’s what I did. “In years to come I think that may be judged Hamilton’s finest race. A great great champion with none of the malice of Schumacher, Prost, Senna. The British public need to appreciate this man more. He’s a gent on and off the track. Love him to bits.” Hamilton did incredibly well to keep his composure. Absolutely no question about that.“They were two big hits, I don’t know how they both continued,” says Di Resta of the contact between Hamilton and Verstappen.The answer is that Verstappen wins by virtue of having won more races this season. So that’s obviously not a potential issue at all!“Either way, absolute madness from Verstappen, who is a danger to everyone else on the track now. “Also, re: “why didn’t Lewis just go around”, I suspect that because Verstappen had slowed so unnaturally, he was worried there might be an obstacle - crashed backmarker or debris - that would’ve been the reason Verstappen slowed, so wouldn’t have wanted to overtake at speed and smash into something.”That incident, by the way, is being investigated so it’s possible Verstappen will be punished in some way.“I don’t think there was anything malicious from Max at that point.”I was wondering the same thing. Was it something to do with the fact that third place was so far back it wouldn’t have made any difference? I honestly don’t know.Going into the Abu Dhabi grand prix, in seven days, both Hamilton and Verstappen are on 369.5 points each. Remarkable stuff, no matter what the rights and wrongs of what happened today, and what happened across the race. Bizarrely, my video feed dropped out at the precise moment that Verstappen was asked about the little shunt with Hamilton, and came back just as he was finishing his answer. Sky Sports then apologised for that, so it wasn’t a problem at my end. Strange.A remarkable race that was far from perfect. A farce? I’m not sure. I think Hamilton has every right to be unhappy with some of Verstappen’s driving ... as for the little shunt, it did look like Verstappen veered into Hamilton’s path at the last minute. Whether that constitutes ‘brake testing’ him is another question.  “It will be decided in Abu Dhabi, hopefully we’ll have a good weekend there.”An absolutely crazy grand prix, with a lot of questions to be answered: Is that circuit too dangerous for Formula One? Was the punishment for Verstappen handled correctly? For just two ...There is a massive amount to unpick from that race but what Martin Brundle says on commentary for Sky Sports is surely right: Verstappen crossed the line today in terms safety and fair racing. “Verstappen’s got to look at his driving standards, that was too much today,” says Brundle. “That’s more like it! Great job today guys!” says Hamilton on the radio.“So if it stays like this they will be equal on points but Max ahead on wins - guaranteed then that he will crash into Lewis’s car and do a Schumie,” emails Steve Ditchburn.Hamilton has over seven seconds at the front of the race! Incredible! Is Hamilton going to remonstrate with Verstappen at the end over what he called his ‘fucking crazy’ driving?Verstappen has now apparently been hit with a five-second time penalty for leaving the track (that must be a few laps ago, when Hamilton overtook him on the startfinish straight ...)Verstappen was clearly slowing though, why didn’t Hamilton just go around him, even if he was slightly over to the middle of the track from the left ?Race control have instructed Verstappen to give the place back to Hamilton. “Red Bull will say we tried to give him the place back, and he ran into us ...” says Brundle ... “Mercedes will say he brake-tested us.” “He just brake-tested me!” Hamilton says of Verstappen. Wolff is pictured looking furious in the pits. Along with the rest of the team. What is going on!!? There is more debris on the track.I don’t agree with that. Hamilton got a better start, by a mile, he ‘owned the corner’ as Brundle said. And Verstappen, in desperation, went off track to try and keep the lead.Thanks for the kind words!

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinThere were 5,156 new cases of Covid-19 reported by the Department of Health on Sunday while the number of hospital patients went back over 500, rising 16 to 503 of whom 110 are in intensive care.Another 1,422 cases of the virus were reported in Northern Ireland, and a further seven Covid-related deaths.The figures came as new Covid testing rules for all travellers arriving into the State came into force on Sunday in response to the spread of the Omicron variant.Those with proof of vaccination can show a negative, professionally administered antigen test carried out no more than 48 hours before arrival or a PCR test taken within 72 hours before arrival. Those who are unvaccinated must show a negative PCR test result.On Sunday UCD virologist Gerald Barry said that while the aim of the measures was to dramatically reduce the spread of Omicron, the science did not support the measures proposed.He said the data coming out of Africa on Omicron was “troubling to say the least”. He said based on current data showing more reinfection and increased transmission, if it came to the State with 4000-5000 cases per day “that’s a very worrying scenario” and cases would “shoot up”.At the start of the week the Government announced that all incoming travellers except those travelling from Northern Ireland will have to present a negative test result in order to enter the country irrespective of their vaccination status.The test requirements were due to be introduced from midnight on Thursday. However, the system was postponed at the last minute to midnight on Sunday in order to allow airlines prepare for checks.Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary had described the move as “nonsense” and “gobbledygook”.New rulesFurther measures were announced by the State on Friday following stark warning from public health officials about the Omicron variant. From Tuesday until at least January 9th, indoor hospitality will be limited to parties of up to six adults per table, while nightclubs will be closed and indoor events limited to half a venue’s capacity.Advice has been issued that households should not host more than three other households in their home, while the use of the vaccine pass is to be extended to gyms, hotel bars and restaurants.Dr Barry said the State was introducing restrictions again when so many other public health measures could be taken. He said the State needs to multiply testing by five, contract tracing needed to be much better in schools and sequencing needed to be done a lot more.Meanwhile, more than 150 passengers have departed Morocco for Ireland on a repatriation flight organised by the Government.The 156 passengers on the flight from Marrakech to Dublin included Irish citizens as well as citizens of several other European Union countries and the UK.The journey was organised after flights to and from Morocco were suspended earlier this week until at least December 13th, amid fears over the spread of Omicron.The repatriation flight on Saturday was operated on behalf of the Government by Ryanair.Responding to news of the flight’s departure, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney hailed the efforts of the Irish Embassy in Rabat in the operation, tweeting: “Well done and thank you!”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 halving capacity for indoor events a logistical nightmare musician says","story":"The Bord Gáis Energy Theatre said it was currently working to determine how best to manage bookings for the upcoming schedule of The Lion King. Photograph: Alan Betson Live music and theatre venues and performers grappled over the weekend to respond to the new Covid restrictions which will halve limited for a month from Tuesday. The Coronas cancelled their concert in the Opera House, Cork on Tuesday due to the new Government restrictions . “We tried our best to see if we could make it work somehow under the new restrictions but it’s just not possible,” the band said in a tweet. “We are currently looking for an alternative date, ticket holders will be contacted by the ticketing provider as soon as possible. Monday nights’ sold out show will go ahead as planned - safely,” it said. The move to halve the capacity is an “absolute nightmare” logistically for anyone with a sold out show in December, the lead singer of Ham Sandwich has said. Niamh Farrell said the band was waiting to hear from venues about gigs booked for December but she does not see how they can go ahead. “How do you decide? How do the venues work it out,” she told Brendan O’Connor on RTE Radio. She said the industry had been “hit with another blow”.She said it feels like musicians are being used as a “scapegoat” like “what we do is a hobby” . Ticketmaster urged customers to “please bear with” it while organisers make arrangements following the Government announcement. It said information will be made available as soon as possible.The 3Olympia Theatre in Dublin said it was working with promoters, artists and ticket agents on the logistics involved with shows here in the short term over the ChristmasNew Year’s period.In a statement the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre said it was “currently working with Disney Theatrical Productions to determine how best to manage bookings for the upcoming schedule of The Lion King”. It urged customers to be patient as it worked through the information.Responding to the Government move, the Gaiety Theatre said it was “ working on a system that is fair to our loyal customers and can efficiently handle a large number of ticketing queries that this difficult situation creates”. The Little Mermaid Christmas panto is currently on stage at the theatre. HospitalisationsThe Government on Friday announced its most wide-ranging introduction of new restrictions this year after “stark” warnings from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to take immediate action in the face of the threat from the Omicron variant.From Tuesday until at least January 9th, indoor hospitality will be limited to parties of up to six adults per table, while nightclubs will be closed and indoor events limited to half a venue’s capacity. Advice has been issued that households should not host more than three other households in their home, while the use of the vaccine pass is to be extended to gyms and hotel bars and restaurants. Trinity College immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill said the main reason for the new restrictions was the new Omicron variant, and he thought they were needed as the “next three to four weeks are going to be tough”. Speaking to Brendan O’Connor on RTÉ radio, he said it was “strange” that restrictions were being introduced when things are stabilising, with the lowest hospital numbers since November 6th. Prof O’Neill said he was “hopeful” at news that the Omicron variant may have a piece of the common cold virus in it which could make it more like the common cold.On Saturday People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy said the reason for the restrictions was because the Government made “huge mistakes” in terms of cutting contact tracing for schools and restoring full capacity to public transport and offices and not moving quickly enough with antigen testing. CommunicationsThe latest measures were confirmed after tensions re-emerged between the Coalition and its public health advisers during testy exchanges earlier in the day.Nphet had warned that while it was “impossible to quantify the level of risk” from Omicron, this may become clear only “when it may be too late to take mitigating measures”.Saying he shared the “frustration” of the public, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced a range of restrictions on hospitality as well as associated financial supports.The issue of official communications on Covid-19 was raised at Cabinet, where Ministers took a formal decision that all communications on Covid were now to be managed by and done through the Government Information Service (GIS), which would apply to civil servants and members of advisory bodies. Several well-placed sources said the intervention was seen as a direct response to disquiet among some senior Coalition figures over Nphet’s media strategy.Minister of State Colm Brophy said on Saturday the Government decision meant GIS would “co-ordinate the message” and there would be “one single message”.However, Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin told Virgin Media News on Saturday that while there was a need for clarity of message there was also a need to ensure the Government did not control the message and the public had full access to public health advice. Business Supports The Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) on Saturday described as “extremely disappointing” the “low level” of supports announced by the Government amid the new restrictions. “They fall far short of what is urgently needed given the scale of the crisis now facing the sector,” the IHF said.The Government reopened applications for the pandemic unemployment payment for people from impacted sectors, and a targeted version of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme for the hospitality sector. Businesses such as restaurants and theatres will be able to access the scheme despite not being fully closed. A commercial rates waiver for the first three months of 2022 will be introduced for the hospitality and entertainment sector. An extra €25 million will be made available to support the live entertainment sector. However, the cuts to the employment wage subsidy scheme (EWSS) – the rates of which were cut this week – were not reversed.“It is devastating that the Government has failed to restore employment supports for hotels, despite the collapse in business levels witnessed throughout the country by our sector. We are calling on the Government to revisit this decision and urgently restore EWSS supports to November levels,” IHF president Elaina Fitzgerald Kane said. She said December trade normally sustained very challenging off-peak months but this has been “wiped out”, with occupancy rates of just 35 per cent for December. Meanwhile, waiting times for a Covid booster vaccine were up an hour at Citywest in Dublin on Saturday morning, the HSE said. Boosters are currently being offered to healthcare workers and those aged 60-69 at various walk-in centres across the State. The total number of booster vaccines administered so far is 913,670. Also on Saturday more than 150 passengers departed Morocco for Ireland on a repatriation flight organised by the Government.The 156 passengers on the flight from Marrakech to Dublin included Irish citizens as well as citizens of several other EU countries and the UK.The journey was organised after flights to and from Morocco were suspended earlier this week until at least December 13th, amid fears over the spread of the new Omicron Covid-19 variant.The repatriation flight on Saturday was operated on behalf of the Government by Ryanair.Responding to news of the flight’s departure, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney hailed the efforts of the Irish Embassy in Rabat in the operation, tweeting: “Well done and thank you!”Meanwhile, live music and theatre venues have been grappling to respond to the new Covid restrictions announced on Friday which will see indoor events limited to half capacity for a month from Tuesday.

Photograph:  Brandon BellGetty ImagesA Covid-19 test centre near Dublin Airport has announced plans to open on Christmas day and St Stephen’s day to accommodate people planning to travel to the United States straight after Christmas. As fears of the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 mounted last week, the US Centre for Disease Control announced a significant change to the rules which will meant that from Monday all international travellers to the United States will have to product a negative Covid test carried out within a 24 window of departure irrespective of whether or not they have been vaccinated. As well as accepting PCR test results, the US still allows professionally conducted rapid antigen tests to be used as proof that a traveller is not infected with the virus. The latter tests can be done within 15 minutes. However, with most testing centres in Ireland closed on Christmas Day, anyone planning to travel to the US on St Stephen’s Day might struggle to get a test that meets the necessary requirements. Aer Lingus has two flights from Dublin Airport to New York on December 26th, with one scheduled to depart at 6.40am and the other with a departure time of 11.35am. A Boston-bound flight, meanwhile, departs from Dublin at 2.05pm. There is also an Aer Lingus flight to Chicago from Dublin with a departure time of 11.35am.Assuming people need to have their tests fully completed at least four hours before they depart – to allow them sufficient time to make their way through the airport and through US immigration – they will need to have the tests carried out either on Christmas Day or early on the morning of December 26th.The RocDoc testing centre at Dublin Airport is normally open between the hours of 8am and 7pm, but is closed on Christmas Day. It is not yet taking bookings for December 26th. The Randox testing centre, meanwhile, has normal opening hours from 2am until 11pm, but is closed on Christmas Day and the earliest available slot it has for St Stephen’s Day for a rapid antigen test is 10.40am.However V1 Medical in Swords said on Sunday that it had opened bookings for Christmas Day between 10am and 2pm and St Stephen’s Day from 6am until 2pm to facilitate passengers. “Our wonderful team have volunteered to give up some of their Christmas so passengers don’t have theirs ruined,” the centre said. Dr Simon Collins, who runs the Travel Health Clinic on Dublin’s Dawson Street said “it is going to be tricky for people” . “If they want to fly on the 26th, they will have to get tested on the 25th or early on the 26th and I think people will have to make decisions about whether or not they want to do that, and there could be a lot of empty seats on some flights.”Josh Barnes is due to fly to the US on St Stephen’s Day to visit family he has not seen in two years. Initially the plan was he, his wife and three children were going to travel, but with Covid-19 still a significant problem and no vaccinations available for his children, the family decided that he would travel alone.

Photograph:: Julien BehalPA WireThe National Public Health Emergency Team has not been “gagged”, Taoiseach Micheal Martin said on Sunday, and the Government would continue to follow its advice in the coming weeks.“There is no question of anybody being gagged,” Mr Martin told reporters in Ennis this afternoon.He was speaking after a Government decision on Friday that all communications about Covid were to be managed through the Government Information Service, based in Government Buildings.“Co-ordination is important in terms of co-ordinating government messages,” Mr Martin said.“There will always be difficulties, and mistakes will get made . . . There’s no playbook that you take off the shelf.”He said that “overall countries that have generally abided by public health advice have done well, and Ireland has done well compared to other countries.”Mr Martin said the Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan “fully recognises the importance of . . .. co-ordinating messaging and everything, there’s no issue there.”“From my perspective, and I’ve been very clear from the beginning of the pandemic, public health advice is very important and central to responding to this epidemic and we’re doing that and will continue to do that,” Mr Martin said.He said that current restrictions would be in place until there was a better understanding of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. “It will two to three weeks until we have a better picture with regard to Omicron before the scientists globally will have a collective view on it . . . First of all, identify how really infectious it is , the degree to which it will escape vaccines, if it does, and how virulent is it.”He said that “Public health will advise, Government will decide.”“We need to hold our nerve,” he said. The Government announced a new set of restrictions on Friday including tighter cuts to the number of people who can eat indoors and attend indoor entertainment and sporting events from Tuesday until January 9th. Some Covid-19 restrictions could be removed quite quickly if concerns in relation to the Omicron variant do not materialise, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said on Sunday. “It is essentially precautionary in nature, this is a pre-emptive move by Government based on advice because there are a significant number of questions we cannot yet answer in relation to the Omicron variant.” Michael McGrath said. Speaking on RTE’s the Week in Politics, he added: “We expect to get some of those answers quite quickly and, if those answers are benign or favourable and some of the concerns in relation to Omicron do not materialise, then I anticipate that some of these restrictions can be removed quite quickly. Unvaccinated Mr Martin also appealed to people who had not been vaccinated to take up their first and second dose and said that people should take up their booster when offered. “Because we know now that the unvaccinated have a disproportionate impact on our health services, on our ICU beds, and it’s as clear as daylight that you’re taking real risks if you don’t get vaccinated in terms of your own personal health and the health of others,” he said.But also the emrgence of anti-virals will be important in the new year and there will be childhoon vaccination programme in the new yearFinancial SupportsThe Government will look at raising the €5,000 a week cap on financial support for large businesses affected by re-introduced Covid-19 restrictions in the coming days, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has saidIn response to new restrictions announced for the hospitality sector last Friday, the Government is reopening the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) for people from affected sectors at the higher weekly rate of €350 and a targeted version of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme for hospitality businesses.Mr Donohoe said that for “some particularly larger businesses who are large employers” the €5,000 a week cap “may need revision” and that would be looked at “in the next few days.”The minister told Newstalk’s On The Record radio programme that the PUP would be reopened to new entrants at the higher rate of €350, currently not available to other PUP recipients, to people who “now find their employment has gone nearly overnight.”He referred to nightclub workers who will be out of work after their closure was announced again. “We appreciate that there are a group of workers in a really important part of our hospitality sector in particular, who are finding themselves unemployed again all over again within a year and we have a particular responsibility to them,” said Mr Donohoe.The minister said that the Government was “in a different place” with Covid-19 and needed to look at targeted “sector by sector” supports rather than general supports for the wider economy.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"ongoing covid pressure finds cracks between government and nphet","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar  described the decision of the Government to impose further restrictions as ‘peculiar’, but also one he understood.  Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireAs the pressure mounted from the fourth Covid-19 wave and the fresh threat from the Omicron variant, it duly found a crack in the relationship between the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) and the Government. There were sharp exchanges at the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid last Friday and even sharper words when Ministers later gathered for a full Cabinet meeting to approve the latest restrictions.Ministers were angry they were hearing about Nphet’s recommendations in the media, while there was also simmering discontent in some parts of Government after chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan wrote to parents telling them to put masks on their nine-year-olds. Holohan’s opposition to Government moves to promote antigen testing had also riled many senior people in and around the Coalition. In truth, the relationship between Nphet and Government has had more than its fair share of ups and downs. When it seemed that the pandemic was winding down in the early autumn, the Government was on the verge of reforming Nphet so that it would cease to exist, at least as the body everyone has come to know in the course of the last 18 months. Inevitability The caricature of Holohan as the real Taoiseach got up Government noses, because everyone could see there was more than a grain of truth to it.The advent of the fourth wave and the restrictions introduced to cope with it have re-established Nphet’s role at the epicentre of the response to the pandemic, even before the news of the new Omicron variant. People at the centre of Government realised the inevitability of that, but that didn’t mean they had to like it. The cross words of last week stemmed in part from the sense among Ministers that they were being left with no choice but to accept the new Nphet-recommended restrictions. But it also reflected the frustration that the entire country is feeling after being clobbered with first the fourth wave and now the frightening uncertainty of the new variant, which threatens to unleash a torrent of fresh infections on a health system straining under the existing pressures. And while hospital numbers and ICU admissions have begun to ease off, senior figures fret that the hospital system would be unable to cope if Omicron hit with the force that some people fear it will.The public mood, meanwhile, is a mixture of weariness, resentment, fearfulness and anger that the Government hasn’t done enough: insufficient test and trace no air filters travel restrictions too late antigen tests not free not enough hospital capacity whatever. Whenever things deteriorate with Covid, there’s always a blame game. An opinion poll in the Sunday Independent suggests the unvaccinated are being drawn into the line of fire. Meanwhile, the Government points the finger at Nphet after a week of chaotic communications from within its own ranks. Scratchy debatesFine Gael grumbles about Fianna Fáil Ministers, focusing again on Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. Nphet blames the virus. There’s more than enough blame to go around.Navigating the uncertain currents of this jumpy and grumpy public mood is a tricky business for politicians. With debates getting scratchy and opinion polarising, it’s hard to be on everyone’s side. Eyebrows were raised around Government when Tánaiste Leo Varadkar made a game effort - describing the decision of the Government (in which he is, in case you forgot, second-in-command) to impose further restrictions as “peculiar”, but also one he understood. Well, yes, it would be odd if Varadkar did not understand it, given he is part of the body that actually made the decision. But his intervention was a sign of just how nervy people are getting in Government as they await more information on the new variant. A difficult few weeks is in prospect.

Photograph: Lukas CochEPAAustralia’s medicine regulator on Sunday provisionally approved the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for children between the ages of five and 11, with the health minister saying the rollout could begin from January 10th.After initial delays with its general Covid-19 inoculation programme, Australia has swiftly become one of the world’s most-vaccinated countries, with nearly 88 per cent of Australians over the age of 16 having received two doses.The high vaccination rate has helped slow the spread of the virus and promote a speedy economic recovery, with the government planning to raise its 2022 growth forecast within weeks.The efficacy of vaccines against the new Omicron variant, which is spreading in Australia, remains unknown.The most populous state, New South Wales, reported two more Omicron cases on Sunday, bringing the total to 15 cases, and the Australian Capital Territory confirmed its second.Parliament House was closed over the weekend to the public until further notice after a staffer to a member of parliament tested positive for Covid-19 after the legislature’s final sitting week of the year on Friday.The variant of that infection case has not been disclosed, but health authorities said the staff member was fully vaccinated.Vaccine coverageWhile nationwide vaccinations are voluntary, states and territories have mandated shots for many occupations, and some require full vaccination to access most hospitality services and non-essential retail.Australia’s overall childhood immunisation coverage is also one of the highest in the world, with 95 per cent of five year olds inoculated with vaccines recommended for their age, health data showed.The Pfizer vaccine for those children still needs the approval of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Once approved, it will be available to about 2.3 million children in the five-11 age group.Despite battling many outbreaks this year, leading to months of lockdown in Sydney and Melbourne – Australia’s largest cities – the country has had only about 834 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 7.9 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation, a fraction of the toll in many other developed nations.Australia has had just less than 217,000 cases in total and 2,042 deaths. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"cambridge students union launches witch hunt student leaked","story":"Students\u0027 union officials at a Cambridge University college have launched a “witch hunt” for the leakers of mandatory race classes for freshers, in a bid to have them ousted.A bitter war of words has broken out at Wolfson College with student leaders accusing those they represent of being “very cowardly” and “sowing ision”, in the latest woke row to flare at Oxbridge.It came after students at the college approached The  with screenshots of compulsory anti-racism workshops all new students were told to attend this autumn term.The online classes claimed “whiteness is centric” as part of “white supremacy” in modern British society, and covered microaggressions, privilege and intersectionality.Students unhappy with the Cambridge college’s “wokest of the woke” direction then told this newspaper of another row in which their peers complained that a matriculation photographer “made them feel unsafe” by asking “gentlemen to help the ladies” dismount a raised platform in ceremonial gowns.Now the Wolfson College Student Association (WCSA), the students’ union at the mostly postgraduate college, has vowed to find and ban the leakers from the union’s official online forum, where the furore has centred.Those responsible will be removed from the 450-member WCSA Facebook group, the main noticeboard where vital updates, events and welfare issues are communicated to students since the pandemic forced messages online.Students have reacted with fury at the “witch hunt”, while the Free Speech Union said a “student mob” had taken control of the college, which counts several country leaders among its alumni.Scott Dunleavy, the WCSA president, told students in an angry statement last week: It is disappointing to see that some members of this community want to sow ision, uncertainty, and distrust amongst their peers.“It is even more disappointing that they choose to do this entirely anonymously. It is frankly very cowardly, and I would expect better of the students here. I feel it necessary to add that we know the identity of at least one of the students who is leaking these screenshots, and that they will be removed for breaking the confidentiality of the group.Mr Dunleavy also doubled down on the compulsory race workshops. WCSA is proud of the initiatives it has put forward over the past academic year, including its anti-racism workshops, and we fully intend to build upon these in the coming year,” he said.“We are proud to support our entire community and address and action issues that affect us all.Sources inside the college said the union initially banned an innocent student and some students had started a rebel group in protest. One said: “They post lots of welfare issues on the Facebook group that never reach the student mailing list, such as recent drink spiking events at the university. How can they create two tiers of students and deny people this information?”Toby Young, general secretary of the Free Speech Union, said: “The college authorities should be embarrassed. They’ve relinquished their leadership role and the result is that a student mob is now in charge.He added: Why would anyone want to go to Wolfson if the college is now run by a group of Maoist thugs in short trousers?”In the mandatory race workshops, students were told microaggressions were brief, everyday interactions that left people feeling devalued, such as saying “you speak good English”. Another PowerPoint slide claimed: “Google search images are white people unless you specify otherwise.”Another row in October saw students write a formal letter of complaint accusing a matriculation photographer of sexism for asking “gentlemen to help the ladies” at the end of the onboarding ceremony. They claimed this created a “targeted atmosphere of inequality” and punctured a “safe space for all genders” on campus.Wolfson College and its student association did not respond to requests for comment.More from NewsPrince Harry voiced ‘concerns’ over motives of Saudi donor to Charles’s foundationProsecutors refuse to rule out charges against high school where four pupils died in mass shootingHealth and social care levy will ‘only go up’, warns Jeremy HuntBy attempting to punish Britain for Brexit, Irish nationalists are forgetting their own historyBritain’s biggest model railway makes tracks back to 1983More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"climate change committee has vastly overplayed hand","story":"The UK Climate Change Committee (CCC) this week published a report on the outcome of COP26, predictably calling for government to “walk the talk” and implement policies that will deliver net zero by 2050. True to form, the CCC is acting like an eco-activist NGO rather than offering balanced and independent advice. And, as usual, its recommendations are being treated as beyond questioning.To grasp the scale of influence this independent advisory body now holds, look no further than Parliament’s decision in 2019 to wave through the net zero target without even a Commons vote. In a move that one expert described as a “failure of politics,” our elected representatives bypassed the opportunity to scrutinise the policy and associated secondary legislation, because they relied on the CCC’s improbable assessment that net zero was “necessary, feasible, cost effective” and “achievable with known technologies”.The economic analysis in the Committee’s 2019 Net Zero Report has been subsequently criticised for a lack of rigour and transparency. Detailed economic analysis on net zero pathways was absent, but the CCC nonetheless concluded the cost of achieving it by 2050 would be 1-2 per cent of GDP. The underlying calculations weren’t published until long after the legally binding target had been legislated. But deference towards bodies like the Climate Change Committee allows government departments to introduce potentially costly or disruptive policies without taking full responsibility for their decisions – or full accountability if things go wrong.This autumn it became starkly apparent that, with current technology, our small island can either be net zero or have secure and affordable energy. It cannot, at present, have both. In guiding us towards very specific targets rather than planning for a range of outcomes over a lengthy period, the CCC is helping shut down the market discovery process, meaning we may never uncover the most cost-effective solutions to decarbonisation.In the 13 years since the CCC was established, its scope has expanded enormously to include ever-increasing areas of the economy and our way of life. This latest briefing, for instance, makes pronouncements on foreign aid, insisting we should “restore the commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP”. The report also takes a view on our diets, seeking to cut meat and dairy consumption by reducing demand not just to reduce emissions or pressure on land for deforestation, but also to benefit “public health”. It was F A Hayek who wrote that “the greatest danger to liberty today comes from the efficient expert administrators exclusively concerned with what they regard as the public good”.The Committee’s solutions are statist, interventionist and lacking thorough cost-benefit analysis. And though it was set up to provide quality advice including on the economic and social implications of climate policies, it is monomaniacal about decarbonisation.What’s more, almost all of its resources are devoted towards mitigation rather than adaptation – a gamble when our contribution to global emissions is so small that meaningful success in the former relies on the kind of international action COP26 hoped, and failed, to guarantee.The idea that, if we are to halt climate change then we need to start doing things differently, has become mainstream in a way that eco-warriors from the 1990s only dreamt of. That the climate change challenge is being taken seriously by politicians is a positive development. But if the body advising the Government on climate change does not learn how to make balanced decisions pegged to rigorous cost-benefit analysis, then we will soon find ourselves in deeply troubled waters. Annabel Denham is Director of Communications at the IEAMore from NewsProsecutors refuse to rule out charges against high school where four pupils died in mass shootingHealth and social care levy will ‘only go up’, warns Jeremy HuntBy attempting to punish Britain for Brexit, Irish nationalists are forgetting their own historyBritain’s biggest model railway makes tracks back to 1983Storm Barra: UK braces for more torrential rain and 70mph winds days after Storm Arwen struckMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vulnerable children slipped view social worker saw lockdown","story":"From the outside, the semi-detached house in Solihull where six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes lived was like any other in lockdown. The garden was overgrown, bathed in heatwave, and in the window there was a hand-painted rainbow. But behind closed doors Arthur was subjected to unfathomable torture then murdered on June 17 2020, 84 days into lockdown. During the trial that this week found his step-mother guilty of murder and his father of manslaughter, the prosecutor said Arthur had “a bruise for every day of lockdown”.When Britain entered lockdown, everyone who worked with vulnerable children – from teachers, to social workers to the family courts – held their breaths. Schools are the biggest safety net for children, and the eyes and ears of teachers, friends and neighbours are the true frontline of child protection. In July 2020 I spent a day driving around Tipton, near Birmingham, with a child welfare officer based at a secondary school. Kim Maynard is employed by the Q3 Tipton Academy to fill the gaps left by the ever more scarce resources in social services. The streets were eerily empty despite the sunny day and all the children being at home.When lockdown first happened Maynard and her colleagues phoned every family one by one. As time went on their fears mounted. There were more and more informal reports of the pressures building behind closed doors. She got in her mint green Fiesta and started knocking on doors. In total, she visited 256 homes as spring turned to summer. What did she find? “It was an unprecedented time. Families were anxious. Some were very hungry,” she said. Then it got worse. “We get notifications every time domestic abuse cases are reported to social services. That’s gone up in lockdown. Initial assessments by social workers have also gone up. It’s not a happy time.”Across the country reports to the NSPCC’s childline increased by a third during the first lockdown. Subsequently, the number of serious incidents involving the death of a child, or serious harm where there were suspicions, increased by 19 per cent to 536 compared with the previous non-pandemic year. Notifications relating to child deaths increased by 35 to 223. Maynard says that during lockdown the biggest worry was the children forgotten by the social work system. Those who had social workers were being checked on. It was those who were in neglectful homes that weren’t deemed bad enough to qualify for help, or those whose need for help had changed very suddenly, that she feared for. Arthur would have fallen into that latter category after his step-mother moved in. The level of abuse or neglect at which social workers will get involved is called the “threshold for intervention”. These thresholds have risen as resources have become more stretched in recent years, meaning more children don’t qualify for help that schools like Tipton Academy know they need. That’s why they employ people like Kim to support families. In Arthur’s case he was seen by social workers. It’s impossible to understand why they walked away despite seeing pictures of the bruising to his body and knowing what we know now. More will be known with the serious case review. But in lockdown, the state lost the tools to catch the children who needed it. The safety net broke. As the former children’s commissioner Anne Longfield put it on Friday, vulnerable children simply “slipped from view”. Polly Curtis exposé on the failings of the child protection system, Behind Closed Doors - Why We Break Up Families - And How to Mend Them, is published February 2022More from NewsPrince Harry voiced ‘concerns’ over motives of Saudi donor to Charles’s foundationProsecutors refuse to rule out charges against high school where four pupils died in mass shootingHealth and social care levy will ‘only go up’, warns Jeremy HuntBy attempting to punish Britain for Brexit, Irish nationalists are forgetting their own historyBritain’s biggest model railway makes tracks back to 1983More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"astrazeneca vaccines unlucky","story":"“I would just like them to hold their hand up and say, ‘we’re very much aware that this has happened and we’re going to do something about it’. And I’d like them to do that without taking it away in the next breath.“In no other circumstances where so many people have lost their lives would that happen. They wouldn’t say 72 people sadly died in the Grenfell tower fire, but hundreds of people didn’t. We don’t forget those who were wounded in conflict or those who did not come home.”These are the words of Gareth Eve, husband of Lisa Shaw, the 44 year-old BBC Radio Newcastle presenter who died in May of a rare brain hemorrhage, confirmed by a coroner in August to have been caused by rare complications from the Oxford AstraZeneca jab which scientists believe they discovered the trigger for last week.His is a tough story to hear, but it is made worse by being so hard for him to tell publicly.Gareth and hundreds of others in the UK who have lost loved ones, or seen their lives irrevocably changed by blood clots and other vaccine-related injuries, find themselves in a terrible position as the real stories behind the statistics.Not only are they being forced to battle for the lives, memories or continued care of their partners or children but – although it could not be further from the truth – they know that doing so risks them being branded as anti-vaxxers or even unpatriotic.“Lisa rolled her sleeve up for the country and said, ‘Right, well, I’m going to get my jab, because that’s what we are being told is the right thing to do’,” says Gareth, who had his second vaccination after his wife’s death, and is now bringing up the couple’s six-year-old son Zach alone. “She did it, like all the others, because it would mean that our little bit of the world, our family and community was better protected. And yet nobody even recognises them”.The number of people who have life-changing adverse reactions to vaccines for Covid-19 is a tiny proportion of the many millions of vaccines given, but is mounting in absolute numbers. (the exact percentage is not known)Up to November 17, the MHRA had received Yellow Card reports of 426 cases of major thromboembolic events (blood clots) with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the UK following vaccination with AstraZeneca. The overall case fatality rate was 17 per cent with 73 deaths. There have been, in addition, a small number of other rare adverse reactions which have led to death or disablement – as there are with nearly all pharmaceuticals.Sarah Moore, a partner with the London law firm Hausfeld, represents the families of 95 people impacted by such injuries, including Gareth Eve. Nine have suffered bereavement, while most of the others are caring for close relatives with life-changing injuries. “All have experienced, at first hand, a range of severe adverse health events following Covid-19 vaccination,” she says.When Covid vaccines were first authorised for use in the UK, the Government indemnified the manufacturers and took on liability for any adverse reactions. It then added all of the jabs used – including the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine – to the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme (VDPS).“The UK has one of the most comprehensive immunisation programmes in the world, and sensible routine precautions such as these form a huge part of our global-leading standards in safety,” boasted the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, when announcing the move just ahead of the launch of the Covid vaccination campaign in December 2020.“The VDPS is a safety net to help ease the burden on iniduals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, experienced harm due to receiving a government-recommended vaccine,” added the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) at the time.Moore and her clients are not anti-vaccination or suing the government, but campaigning for change: they say the VDPS is not a “safety net” worthy of the name.Launched more than 40 years ago to build confidence in national vaccination programmes, it is now hopelessly out of date – and in danger of doing the exact opposite.Paper-based and under-staffed, it has proven slow, bureaucratic and unresponsive. Claimants must show they are more than “60 per cent” disabled to make a successful claim as well as proving “causation”, which is notoriously difficult to prove. Worse, even for cases that are successful, the maximum total payout is just £120,000.“While £120,000 is a substantial sum of money, it will provide limited security where an inidual has been severely disabled and, particularly, where they may have dependents,” says Moore. “It is significantly lower than the awards that are achieved in personal injury claims involving similarly severe injuries.” Such awards can run to the millions.Historically, the VDPS has received about 100 claims a year, but Covid vaccinations mean that number has dramatically increased.“There are currently c.500 cases (as at November 2021) that require assessment, with this volume currently increasing per week by c.20 cases,” notes a recent government tender document for the running of the service. “It is estimated that in year one of the contract there will be c1500-1800 claims that will require assessment within the first year of the contract,” it adds.Kate Scott, a 32-year-old mum of two boys, age four and one, is one of those claimants. She is struggling to keep the roof over the family’s head after her husband Jamie, 44, suffered a brain injury after receiving the Oxford Astrazeneca jab this spring.Jamie spent 124 days in hospital and was lucky to survive his doctors thought he would need to live in a care home for the rest of his life. But, although he is now home with Kate and their boys, the brain injury he still lives with has changed his life.“We feel like the luckiest unlucky people because, despite all of this, Jamie has made more of a recovery than any of the medical teams thought possible,” she says. “But our life is still dramatically impacted. He’s able to communicate with us and to outsiders, he looks like he’s very much almost back to normal. But for our family that’s not the case.”Jamie can no longer work as a software engineer or even care for his children without supervision, for example.“I solely have to be responsible for the boys as he can’t independently look after them at the moment, which is very difficult for him as well,” says Scott. “He’s amazing. His motivation is truly inspiring, and the doctors have used the term miracle. I feel sometimes when I get upset that I’m being ungrateful. I know that others have lost loved ones.”Kate has had to stop working as a customer service coordinator for a children\u0027s charity to look after Jamie and the children full time. They are struggling financially and Kate worries they may have to sell the family home. She points out the £120,000 maximum payment from the VDPS scheme was worth £500,000 or more when the scheme was launched in 1979.“That’s a lot more money and enough to pay off most people’s mortgages. It would mean Jay could just focus on getting better or one day, he could do a vocational job, perhaps, where there was less pressure on him. It would mean that what has already been traumatic for our children doesn’t get worse. That we don’t have to move house because of it.”In the summer, Kate wrote to Boris Johnson to draw his attention to the holes in the Government’s vaccine safety net. Like others, she pointed out that other developed countries have more generous schemes.“You have suffered a heartbreaking and frightening change but I would like to pay tribute to your strength in proposing changes which you think could improve the situation. You’re not a statistic, and must not be ignored. I am deeply touched by your story.”Johnson went on to say he had asked the DHSC to consider the proposed reforms but, to date, there has been no announcement of change and not a single case has yet been settled via the government scheme. Indeed the DHSC has been directing victims like Gareth and Kate into the benefits system.

It was his happy place – and it left an indelible mark.So precious were the memories of those carefree childhood days that Mr George set about creating a scale model of the Heaton Lodge Junction, near Mirfield, West Yorkshire as it looked in 1983.That was eight years ago. This weekend, having given up his job to dedicate every waking hour to the project, the 53-year-old unveiled what eventually became Britain\u0027s biggest model railway – an astonishing labour of love that recreates every detail, from a Tesco carrier bag caught in a tree to manhole covers in the roads.Included in Mr George\u0027s scale model of the 1.5-mile line is a figure of a 12-year-old boy hanging over a fence. That figure is, of course, his 12-year-old self, based on a black and white photograph he came across while researching the project in 2014.A local snapper had been taking photographs of the locomotives and just happened to capture me and a couple of friends in the background, he told The . When I saw that, it was like a sign that I should plough on.Plough on he did. Mr George, from Ripon, North Yorks, made a pictorial map of the area using some 400 photographs found online alongside his own images and memories.He started making the model at home, focusing on one small section at a time. When it became too big, he realised the project was going to need serious investment of both time and money.In 2017, he sold his share of a supercar driving experience company and leased the basement of a large mill to house the track, which he then focused on full time. The Covid pandemic and lockdown gave him even more scope to move it into fifth gear.When he met his girlfriend last year, Mr George feared she would run a mile if he told her about his project. Instead, he said he was a wine merchant, leasing the space for his business. Model railways don\u0027t have a great reputation, he said. I didn\u0027t want her to leave me in horror.However, his plan backfired when his girlfriend decided to surprise him at work and turned up at the basement unannounced. She was shocked, he admitted. She wondered where all the wine was, but actually she really appreciated the detail and the artistic element. It\u0027s like a huge picture in 3D because it\u0027s of a real place.The completed model, which cost around £250,000, features scale models of 30 trains running on 1,500 metres of track to a specific timetable displayed on arrival boards. It took two friends three years to create the software that makes the railway fully automated.In order to put the model on public display, Mr George had to devise a way of transporting it. He commissioned 40 purpose-built handcarts to relocate it in three lorries.The track is on public display at Wakefield Market, Yorkshire, until Dec 19. Mr George is hoping to take it on a national tour next year.Sometimes I look up and, for a split second, I\u0027m back there in 1983, he said. The lights, the sounds, the smell of the fake diesel fumes – it\u0027s deja vu.More from NewsPrince Harry voiced ‘concerns’ over motives of Saudi donor to Charles’s foundationProsecutors refuse to rule out charges against high school where four pupils died in mass shootingHealth and social care levy will ‘only go up’, warns Jeremy HuntBy attempting to punish Britain for Brexit, Irish nationalists are forgetting their own historyStorm Barra: UK braces for more torrential rain and 70mph winds days after Storm Arwen struckMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chorister 12 becomes bishop 45 minutes","story":"A 12-year-old girl has become a bishop for 45 minutes as part of a cathedral\u0027s long-running tradition.Chorister Isabel Moss donned the bishop\u0027s cope, mitre and ring and carried the staff to lead a service at Salisbury Cathedral on Sunday.She sat in the intricately carved Cathedra – or bishop\u0027s throne – to deliver a sermon and lead the choir and congregation in prayer.Isabel, who is from London but boards at Salisbury Cathedral School in Wiltshire, is the latest in a long line of chorister bishops.The tradition dates back to medieval times when a boy chorister would hold the office of bishop from the Feast of St Nicholas – the patron saint of children – on Dec 6 until the Feast of the Holy Innocents on Dec 28.During that time, he could appoint clergy and distribute the church\u0027s money as he saw fit.Henry VIII put a stop to the practice of appointing child bishops in 1541, declaring it a distraction from proper church business.Salisbury Cathedral revived the practice in its present form in the 1980s. Nowadays, the chorister bishop only holds the role for the service and is as likely to be a girl as a boy.Being chosen for the temporary role is a great honour and marks a chorister\u0027s contribution to the choir and cathedral music. Isabel not only sings with the choir but also plays piano and flute, likes art and is a member of the school\u0027s hockey team.David Halls, the director of music at Salisbury Cathedral, said: Isabel is an exceptionally good singer and an excellent role model for the younger choristers.She has been in the choir for four years and was made a senior chorister in September. She knows how to work hard but also enjoy life, which is exactly what we want our choristers to do. Singing with a cathedral choir is a big responsibility – but it is also great fun.More from NewsPrince Harry voiced ‘concerns’ over motives of Saudi donor to Charles’s foundationProsecutors refuse to rule out charges against high school where four pupils died in mass shootingHealth and social care levy will ‘only go up’, warns Jeremy HuntBy attempting to punish Britain for Brexit, Irish nationalists are forgetting their own historyBritain’s biggest model railway makes tracks back to 1983More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"irans bare faced lies have finally exposed","story":"For decades Iran’s ayatollahs have insisted that, despite all the evidence to the contrary, their nuclear intentions are entirely peaceful, and forcefully rejected any suggestion that they seek to acquire nuclear weapons.Even when presented with highly incriminating proof provided by Western intelligence agencies like the CIA that Iran seeks to build nuclear weapons, the regime has pointed to a fatwa allegedly issued by the country’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that prohibits Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.The fatwa is said to originate from comments Mr Khamenei made in 2003 forbidding the production and use of weapons of mass destruction, which the regime has conveniently referred to when questioned about undeclared aspects of its nuclear programme, such as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility which has the ability to produce material for nuclear warheads.Moreover, Western leaders have naively taken Iran’s denials of bad behaviour at face value. Former US President Barack Obama, for example, as part of his ill-judged effort to agree a nuclear deal with Tehran, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), declared in his address to the UN General Assembly in 2013 that: “The Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons.”Now Iran’s protestations of innocence lie in tatters following the extraordinary admission by one of the country’s leading nuclear experts that Iran has maintained a clandestine nuclear weapons programme for many years. In an interview published on the eve of the reopening of talks in Vienna aimed at reviving the JCPOA,, Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani, who formerly headed the Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation, revealed that Iran had created a “system” to develop an atomic weapon in spite of the Supreme Leader’s fatwa.The purpose of the interview, given to mark the first anniversary of chief Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was to explain the late scientist’s working methods. Instead, Mr Abbasi-Davani, wittingly or otherwise, provided the first confirmation by a senior regime official of Iran’s long-held ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons: “Although our stance on nuclear weapons based on the Supreme Leader’s explicit fatwa regarding nuclear weapons being forbidden is quite clear, Fakhrizadeh created this system, and his concern wasn’t just the defence of our own country,” Mr Abbasi-Davani explained. In other words, Iran’s intention all along has been to develop weapons that can be used to threaten its adversaries in the region such as Israel.In many respects, Mr Abbasi-Davani has done the world a great favour, as his helpful explanation means that, with the resumption of nuclear talks in Vienna aimed at reviving the JCPOA, Western negotiators no longer have to labour under the fiction that Iran’s nuclear intentions pose no threat.And while Mr Abbasi-Davani’s revelations present an inconvenient truth for Iranian apologists like Lord Lamont of Lerwick, the chairman of the British-Iranian Chamber of Commerce, they should encourage the West to take a far harder line with Iran, whose participation in the Vienna talks is aimed more at getting economic sanctions lifted than making any real concessions on its nuclear activities.Iran’s attitude towards the talks, which reconvened in Vienna at the start of this week, was summed up in the draft document it submitted, which placed the emphasis on Western leaders agreeing to lift sanctions, with only minimal concessions offered on its nuclear activities.This prompted America’s usually dovish Secretary of State Antony Blinken to play down any possibility of a breakthrough. “I have to tell you, recent moves, recent rhetoric, don’t give us a lot of cause for optimism,” he said.Iran’s approach prompted Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to call for the “immediate cessation” of the talks.Indeed, if anything, Iran’s attitude has become far more confrontational since the election of hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi in the summer. Britain has accused Iran of subjecting international nuclear inspectors to invasive physical searches in an intimidation campaign designed to block monitoring of sensitive nuclear facilities.And while the Biden administration still clings to the belief that the nuclear deal can be revived, US military officials are less convinced. At the recent Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain, senior US military officers made it clear that military solutions for dealing with Iran’s nuclear programme were very much on the table.Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who met with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss in London last week, takes a similar view, warning that only a credible military threat will stop Tehran’s nuclear programme.Certainly, given the appalling prospect of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, the world can no longer accept Iran’s bare-faced lie that its nuclear intentions are peaceful.More from NewsProsecutors refuse to rule out charges against high school where four pupils died in mass shootingHealth and social care levy will ‘only go up’, warns Jeremy HuntBy attempting to punish Britain for Brexit, Irish nationalists are forgetting their own historyBritain’s biggest model railway makes tracks back to 1983Storm Barra: UK braces for more torrential rain and 70mph winds days after Storm Arwen struckMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"year kamala harris has proved unfit high office","story":"Why did Joe Biden choose Kamala Harris as his Vice President? It was in some ways a peculiar decision. Harris had herself run to be president in the same election. She flopped, despite substantial establishment and financial backing. It became very clear then that people just don’t like her, which ought to be a serious obstacle to high office in a democracy. Harris had also attacked Biden over his imperfect record on matters of race, as part of her bid to beat him in the primaries, and some of Biden’s team can never quite forgive her for that.In other ways, however, Kamala as Biden’s ‘veep’ made perfect sense. As a career politician from California, she was plugged into the west coast power matrixes that dominate the Democratic Party from Hollywood to Silicon Valley – an ultra-liberal world in which scrappy old Biden from Scranton Pennsylvania feels uncomfortable.In reality, it’s been a complete disaster. President Biden’s popularity has plummeted since he took office in January, but Harris is even less loved.It had been widely assumed that 79-year-old, doddery Joe Biden would merely be a “placeholder” President who would make way for Kamala in 2024. But Harris has made such a mess of the various roles she has been given as vice-president - from stopping migration from the Southern border to leading the charge on vaccines - that some figures in Washington are reportedly considering the “nuclear option” of moving her to the Supreme Court and putting a more well-liked vice president in her place in time for the next presidential election. Staff are now leaving her office in their droves because they don’t want to be tarnished as a ‘Harris person’ ahead of 2024.Speculation that she will be shunted to the Supreme Court any time soon may be pretty wild. There’s no denying, however, that, in the Biden-Harris administration, the Democrats have a serious re-electability problem that won’t go away until one of them steps down.Aside from her apparent incompetence, one of Kamala\u0027s biggest problem is that she comes across as a phoney. In the endless videos her press team pumps out to make her seem authentic, she comes across as anything but: a recent film of her feigning wonder at the stars with a group of children went viral for all the wrong reasons.In October, the White House released another somewhat emetic video showing Biden giving Harris flowers for her birthday, but such stunts can’t hide the fact that relations between Team Biden and Team Harris are not at all rosey. The pair are giving fewer and fewer public appearances together as their first term goes on, perhaps because the President’s staff recognise that Harris is an increasingly toxic figure.Harris’s response has been to give herself a rebrand, of course. She has brought in a crisis PR team, including a former strategist to Hillary Clinton. Will they be able to turn her reputation around? It never exactly worked for Hillary.More from NewsPrince Harry voiced ‘concerns’ over motives of Saudi donor to Charles’s foundationProsecutors refuse to rule out charges against high school where four pupils died in mass shootingHealth and social care levy will ‘only go up’, warns Jeremy HuntBy attempting to punish Britain for Brexit, Irish nationalists are forgetting their own historyBritain’s biggest model railway makes tracks back to 1983More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"girl can retire 15 after","story":"Girl can retire at  after starting toy business that made £k in a monthPixie Curtis, from Sydney, Australia, also has a hair accessories firm - Pixies Bows - under her name despite still being at primary school Image: roxyjacenko InstagramByBradley JollyNews Wire:,  Dec | comments A -year-old girl can effectively retire in just five years after launching a toy business which made a whopping £, last month.

Business minister George Freeman was slapped down last week after saying “four or five staff working together every day anyway” were okay, but firms might want to reconsider bringing “hundreds of people around the world to a big party”. Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman responded: “On Christmas parties, we don’t want people to cancel such events.Mr Raab told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday: The rules are very clear. “People can go in and have Christmas parties - of course employers will want to think common sense about how they do that. We wonapost be having a Ministry of Justice-wide Christmas party this year. We will be having appropriate drinks at a smaller scale. The Government wants people to be able to enjoy Christmas this year. People should feel free to go and enjoy those celebrations and every employer will think about the right way to do it and Iaposm the same as everybody .  Later Mr Raab told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show he would “continue to be vigilant” but “we’re in a much more confident position because of the vaccine, because of the boosters”. He said: “I think it’s going to be a great Christmas. All the family, friends, loved ones being able to get together in a way we haven’t been able to do for a couple of years is really important.” Askedhe’d see elderly relative he replied: “Yes. “Of course it always depends a little bit on their personal condition,they’re safeguarding it may be dferent. “But I think people should enjoy Christmas, get their loved ones around them, celebrate it in a way we haven’t been able to in the past.” Government guidance strongly encourages people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, and suggests they could take lateral flow tests before socialising.  Elsewhere Mr Raab refused to deny the Mirror’s exclusive revelations that parties were held in No in November and December last year, while millions of people were under lockdown rules. Boris Johnson has also not denied reports that his staff held a party on December  last year when London was under Tier  restrictions. But while the PM has insisted that no rules were broken, Mr Raab admitted a party would have been a breach of the rules. He said: “If anyone held a party that it is contrary to the rules, of course that is the wrong thing to do. If something unsubstantiated from anonymous sources actually materialised then of course it would be wrong. Cambridge University statistician Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said today he fears increased contacts over the festive season could trigger restrictions in January. “Just like last year with the Alpha iant, this is a terrible time for a iant to come along, when the next two weeks are probably some of the highest-risk periods with a lot of indoor socialising that we know is extremely high risk,” he told Sky News. “It’s appalling timing. I’m sure the Government would love not to disrupt Christmas. What happens after Christmas of course is another matter. The travel restrictions at the moment are only going to slow things up a little bit, possibly or to some extent, but they’re not going to stop it. It’s going to come in.” He added: “The New Year is quite likely to see quite a lot of challenges to face - and as SAGE have said, that could very well mean more stringent measures. I could mention working from home. So far it’s not been recommended but that is known to be extremely effective at halving the number of close contacts people have.” Omicron is spreading pretty rapidly in the UK, a Government adviser warned. Professor Mark Woolhouse, who is a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling , told BBCaposs The Andrew Marr Show: The Omicron iant is highly transmissible, it appears to be spreading very rapidly in South Africa and the early signs are that itaposs spreading pretty rapidly in the UK too. If those trends continue then over the course of the coming weeks and months, Omicron could even come to replace Delta entirely right around the world.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonMinistry of JusticeUniversity of CambridgePoliticsChristmas partyPeriods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Not to mention another eight million unable to see GPs because of Covid and who could have le-threatening conditions like cancer. Mr Streeting said: “If you need a knee op or a hip replacement it has a big impact on your quality of le. “But when it comes to treatment for cancer, time is of the essence.” And he knows. The MP lost a kidney to cancer earlier this year but thanks to NHS surgeons and the care of staff at three London hospitals he is now fighting fit.  He said: “I received outstanding care from the moment I arrived at AE with chronic pain. The staff on the ward were wonderful but there just weren’t enough of them.“It’s only when you have an experience like that you really appreciate how fantastic the NHS is. “As soon as I had my diagnosis everything sped up. This incredible machine kicked into gear. “But before that there was a lot of waiting. And this means there will be a lot of undiagnosed cancer.” Even before the pandemic .million patients were on waiting lists and there were , NHS vacancies. The answer, said Mr Streeting, is better pay and conditions, while keeping a check on the six figure salaries of managers and management consultants. He added: “The biggest priority is to recruit, train and retain staff for the long term. “NHS workers who came to see me were in tears because they were on poverty pay and we will lose themwe don’t pay them properly. “But it’s not simply about money. You need investment but also reform to deliver results for patients.” His first act is to write to Sajid Javid demanding the Health Secretary comes clean over a promise of  new hospitals. He said: “Boris Johnson counts paint jobs as a new hospital. We need to know more about this phantom programme. People are treated in dilapidated hospitals no longer fit for purpose.” He wants aof in-person GP consultations, saying: “Technology frees up time. But face-to-face appointments should be there for those who want it.”  The Ilford North MP slammed Tory hikes in National Insurance and council tax and social care reforms which burden those less well-off.Mr Streeting said: “The air of mild shambles around the PM reflects the way he runs his Government and that has serious consequences.” He said mandatory masks in enclosed spaces should never have been abandoned, adding: “They’re a pain in the backside. But they are a minor inconvenience compared to the consequences for lives and livelihoods.” His promotion at  has prompted talk that he could be a Labour leader.“No leadership ambitions,” he said emphatically. “The only ambition I’ve got is to get Keir Starmer into No.” And he has no plans to avoid Christmas parties, adding: “People must make their own common sense judgements.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSConservative PartyLabour PartyWes StreetingBoris JohnsonHospitalsCouncil taxPoliticsChristmas partyHip replacements\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, this week I was green with envy as Barbadians held a massive shindig to celebrate becoming a republic. Rihanna dazzled as Prince Charles sweated and waffled about the “atrocity of slavery” while the British state he will soon be the head of refuses to pay reparations to the descendants of those slaves. Not that he’d have a say in it. In fact, despite the weird letters he sends to ministers pushing his wacky causes and protecting the £million he earns annually from the Duchy of Cornwall, he won’t have a real say in anything when he’s king. He’ll be as pointless as the valet he pays to put toothpaste on his brush. I won’t join the royalist orgy next year when the Queen’s reign hits  but I’ll admit the plaudits she’ll receive for dedicating herself to the service of her country will be well deserved. The problem for us Republicans is that she has infantilised a nation whose older citizens cling to the black-and-white Britain she links us to, like Jacob Rees-Mogg to his nanny’s apron. But she will be gone soon and when she is, would it be too much to ask for an honest debate about whether the monarchy should go too   Would it be such a bad thing for us to work outwe’d like to follow the path of other grown-up democracies, like Barbados, and elect our head of state rather than have the next royal accident of birth imposed by this one family  Imagine what we could do with all those palaces, not to mention the £ million a year it costs to let them live like dukes and princesses. What a farce those titles are.The Sussexes of Montecito, Calornia, have as much claim on Sussex as my Romanian rescue dog. Same with the Cambridges and the Kents. As for the Yorks, what has that fine city done to deserve the gruesome twosome Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson taking its name  What priceless gall the royal spinners have, painting Meghan Markle as the spawn of the devil, then whistling into the wind when the grand old Duke of York’s name comes up.I think we’d be doing the Royals a favour because judging by the recent two-part BBC documentary on the princes, they look as miserable as sin, while most of them resent us for prolonging their goldfish bowl existence. The current House of Windsor appears to be a backbiting bitchfest where everyone spins and lies to curry favour. And for what  They hate the press, the BBC, makers of The Crown and each other almost as much as doing a proper job. So when the Good Ship Lizzie sails into the sunset, why not let all the Royals, like the Montecito miserabilistsFind Freedom. Permanently. We have nothing to lose but our tugged forelocks.

While Scandinavian countries are often heralded as the best places to see the incredible natural lightshow, you can see them from our very own British Isles -you’re lucky. Scottish island the Isle of Skye offers some of the best views of the magical phenomenon in the UK and The Old Inn is a great base for watching the spectacle. Located in the small village of Carbost and right on the shore of Loch Harport, the pub has spectacular views of the surrounding scenery from its patio. There have been sightings of the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis , here in the winter, as its northern position and low light pollution gives Carbost a good chance of seeing them.But this isn’t all the Old Inn has to offer, as the pub won the  Taste Local Best Pub on Skye award for its high customer satisfaction, great atmosphere and tasty food and drink. Chefs cook up an extensive menu of amazing dishes using locally sourced ingredients, like the oysters which are caught at the neighbouring farm and the meat from farms in the Highlands.

You can find a selection of local ales in the pub, including the Skye Ale range which is brewed on the island. The cosy pub also serves Talisker whisky which has been made at the local distillery since  and is only a short walk away.  The Old Inn also regularly hosts live music from traditional Scottish folk music to more modern rock bands and jazz musicians. The Northern Lights can only be seen in pitch black darkness, but you don’t need to stay at the pub until the early hours of the night, you can book a room and wake at an appropriate time to catch them. There are bed and breakfast en-suite rooms available, as well as the bunkhouse which is more of a posh hostel with a shared kitchen, shared bathrooms and washing and drying facilities. You can also stay in a private self-catering chalet, complete with double beds, communal kitchen and a balcony looking out to the loch in front.  The Isle of Skye is popular with adventurous types who want to hike and climb the Cuillin Hills or kayak in the sea. It’s also perfect for those who want a more chilled out holiday, as you can go on boat trips to explore the area or wildle spotting in the hopes you might get to see the red deer, seals, whales and dolphins that live there. Another recommended place to visit is the famous fairy pools, not too far away from the pub. These are small waterfalls with beautully clear, blue water which you can take a cold dip inyou’re feeling brave. The Old Inn, Carbost, Isle of Skye IV SR.

A bomb squad was present in Litchurch, Derby, where police had carried out a search following a warrant. Shocked witnesses said officers and the Army have blocked off the road while the incident was being dealt with.A  metre exclusion zone was also now in place in the area, reports Derbyshire Live. A man has been arrested on suspicion of making or possessing an explosive substance. A spokesperson for Derbyshire Constabulary said: Officers attended a house in King Alfred Street at around .am. A man has been arrested and remains in police custody. The Explosive Ordnance Disposal team are on site and a number of houses are currently being evacuated in King Alfred Street, Monk Street and Wolfa Street.  Residents are asked to stay away from the area and those evacuated will be contacted when it is safe toto their homes. There is no indication it was a terror-related incident. Chief Superintendent Tracy Lewis said: I would first like to thank everyone for their support and understanding during todayaposs incident. At the forefront of our minds is the safety of all those in the area as well as staff at the scene, and I know they are working hard to allow people back as quickly as it is safe to do so. I am also aware that people will be concerned due to the evacuation and I would like to reassure them that there is no indication at this time that this is a terror-related incident. A man has been arrested on suspicion of making or possessing an explosive substance and officers from the force are continuing their enquiries into the incident. I would urge anyone who has any information that may be of interest to the investigation team to contact the force.  One witness said he saw loads of police and they brought two vans up. He said: Iaposve not been told when I can get back into my house, but to be honest with you, I could get back in my houseI wanted to as I live at the top end. William Fredrick, who is a student, lives near the scene. He said: I had breakfast about pm and I went downstairs to put something out in the bin and there was a bomb disposal unit and a police officer outside. It was pretty nuts. It is not what you expect on a Sunday afternoon. Itaposs usually a pretty quiet neighbourhood, itaposs pretty family orientated. We havenapost been told when we can get back in. You can see them at the scene, so hopefully not too long. Damon Hayes, also a student who lives near the scene, said: It was a bit scary, we were hanging outside of our window anyway. Iaposd literally just woken up. Itaposs usually pretty quiet around here, there are a lot of families in the area and there are a lot of students. Iaposve not been told when I can get back, Iaposve heard nothing yet. An Army spokesperson said: I can confirm an army explosive ordnance disposal team have been called out to King Alfred Street in Derby.

The endangered species is protected in  countries – but in South Africa it is legal to hunt tigers bred in captivity.Big-game hunter Adrian de Guisti told our undercover reporter it was “big business” and offered to pay “good commission” for finding British clients. But the practice is highly controversial and secretive, and he said he would be “burned on social media”it got out. De Guisti, who runs Gotsoma Safaris in Free State Province, said: “I have all five of the dferent tigers. I have Bengal, Siberian, the white, I’ve got the snow tiger, tabby tiger... “I started breeding with tigers in South Africa in . I’m currently charging US, [£,] for an adult tiger.”  It is thought , tigers live in over  breeding facilities in South Africa. Some are sent to zoos and private collectors but, with tiger parts highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine, they are worth more dead than alive. It is feared many end up being shot for trophies and their body parts illegally exported to Asia. Our reporter spoke to De Guisti after we found he had posted, and then deleted, a photo on his website of a dead tiger next to a hunting bow. Big-game hunting in Africa is increasingly popular among some wealthy Chinese customers and our undercover reporter posed as a British hunter with some clients keen to kill a tiger.  De Guisti said: “You did contact the right person. I am a specialist in exotics and I am a specialist in big-game hunting. I only do Big Five [lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and African buffalo] and I then discuss additional trophies with the clients, but there’s a matter of trust that’s got to be bought first.” He told us to book a “simple” hunting safaris, for a lion or buffalo, and went on: “You come with your clients. We sit around the table. I tell you what I can do. I put my cards on the table, you put your money on the table, then it’s game on.”  He was nervous that we were calling from the UK, saying: “% of our trouble regarding big cats comes from Britain. If this call is recorded I’m going to be burned for it on social media. Butit’s a genuine situation we can definitely do business. You did find pictures of me hunting tigers... I’m not denying it.”  De Guisti admitted his business breeding lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars is dependent on income from hunting. He said: “No photographic safaris can create income for a guy like me in my business. It’s only the hunters’ money that does make it happen.” Hunting captive tigers is allowed in South Africa, though some states require a permit.

But last month, bosses at bus operator Go North West Ltd gave Tracey her notice - ruling that she was no longer tall enough to safely drive their vehicles, according to Unite the Union. The trade union said Tracey was offered an alternative role in the company, but one with fewer hours and less pay - which would leave her in financial hardship.Tracey was handed her -week notice after refusing the new position. She is now appealing the decision, Manchester Evening News reports. In the days since her battle was made public, Bolton-born actress Maxine Peake, Coronation Street star Julie Hesmondhalgh, and actor James Quinn, have all got in touch to offer words of support, Tracey said.I could have never expected anything like this, she said. Iaposm overwhelmed and so emotional with it at the minute. People are getting in touch with me who I donapost even know. Itaposs been absolutely lovely to get that response, itaposs like one big family. As part of the fight for Tracey to keep her job, her colleagues have started a petition which now has more than , signatures. A Unite the union spokesman said: “Tracey is a hardworking, loved and a valued member of the NW    Branch and the Queens Road family who deserves to be commended for her years of service to the traveling public of Greater Manchester. “However Go North West Ltd has dismissed her from employment because they changed the manufacturer specication on their fleet of buses resulting in five foot tall Tracey being physically unable to operate company vehicles safely.  “Go North West Ltd have refused to consider proposals from Tracey and her Unite trade union reps to keep her in employment. “This has resulted in her unfair dismissal from Go North West Ltd for capability to fulfil her role a PCV driver. “The company’s only resolution is to offer Tracey a position in the company that would see Tracey’s pay and hours cut signicantly leaving her in financial hardship. A spokesman from Go North West, which runs  routes, mostly in North Manchester, said: “We are extremely proud of our team of drivers who continue to perform excellent work keeping the people of Manchester moving. Unfortunately, a situation has arisen where we have had to bring a driver’s employment to an end. This is a complex case, and the appeals process is ongoing.

The fundraising champion pretended to be Santa by leaving boot marks around the house. His ever-proud daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore chuckles: “Back in the day he’d put on his wellies and create an imprint, in fake instant snow, that ran down the hall, all the way from the chimney, then to our Christmas tree. “We live off the joy – the hilarious stories of us living together. So now my children do it. Even though it’s completely ridiculous!” This is the first Noel – or no wellie – without Sir Tom, who lived with Hannah and her family for  years.  In an exclusive interview, Hannah admits that despite the pain of an empty chair at the dinner table this year, his presence will be felt. In the  months since he died, Hannah is reminded almost daily of the lives he has saved through his message of hope and positivity.

I’ll think, ‘Would you agree with this, Dad’ ”Sir Tom, who died after contracting pneumonia and coronavirus, was knighted by The Queen for his remarkable effort at the family home in Marston, Moretaine, Beds.  Hannah , , husband Colin and their kids Benji, , and Georgia, , miss him greatly but have the fondest memories. She goes on: “The pure, unadulterated grief doesn’t go away. I still turn asI’m going into his room to catch up. I went in yesterday with Georgia. I said ‘Let’s go make Grandpa’s room happy’ and we sat on his bed and watched her TV. “Benji still uses ‘Grandpa’s fixing shed’. He’s doing A-level Design Technology because of their relationship.” Last Christmas the spotlight was on Sir Tom and his family as they enjoyed a holiday to Barbados – a welcome break after the exertions of .  There is joy, emotion and a Sir Tom like twinkling eye as Hannah recalls: “ My happiest memory of that was the look on his face as Georgia came out of the sea. I think he just felt elation that he’d lived to see her grow up into a young woman. It was pure magic. “It will be hard this Christmas... this year is just the four of us because my sister and her family are away. “There’s an empty chair, where he would sit. But we will fill that loss.”  The kids used to rouse Grandpa at Christmas. Hannah says: “Georgia would come back and say, ‘well, he’s definitely still alive,’ in the way only kids can. When he eventually got up he’d arrive and say, ‘huh, the table is all laid’. ‘Yes Dad, you were sleeping,’ I’d say. ‘No, I was not asleep!’ he’d reply – and the room filled with laughter.” After nearly two years of Covid, and now new iant Omicron, what would Sir Tom say to people – and to those doubting vaccination  Hannah tells us: “He’d very much say, ‘The tough times can feel like they go on a long time, but they do always get better’. His le of  years had some very dficult times in it. He was born into Spanish flu. He then fought in a war at the age of . But we have to look to the future and never lose hope that a better day is coming.  “Dad would be saying he understood people’s anxiety’s over the speed of the vaccine rollout, but we must look a little inward, reflect and treat it as a social responsibility. “I think he’d be saying ‘Do it for other people’. But I don’t think we should mandate people to have the vaccine. We don’t want to be forcing anyone’s hand, rather just to reflect.” Next week, the Foundation will reveal a major revamp of future plans – tightly under wraps for now.  One of its missions has been to help tackle loneliness. Hannah says: “I get stopped all the time. Many are veterans, who say just knowing our family supports them and recognises they exist, allows them to live with hope every day. “Somebody  said to me, ‘You do know you save lives don’t you  It never occurred to me and in that moment I was like, ‘oh... thank you’.” Such feedback makes her chats with Sir Tom yet more poignant. Hannah adds: “I visited his grave in Yorkshire a few weeks ago and had a little word. It’s lovely that he’s buried alongside other family I never knew. “I said to him, ‘I hope you are all happy together.

Most mornings thereaposs a massive fight between Charlotte and George as to what song is played. And I have to, now, basically prioritise that one day someone does this one, and another day itaposs someone aposs turn.  So, George gets his go, then Charlotte gets her go. Such is the clamour for the music. He added: Itaposs a really happy moment where the children just enjoy dancing, messing around, and singing. The prince has shared his kidsapos favourite song to listen to. The future King continued: One of the songs that the children are loving at the moment is Shakira, Waka Waka. Thereaposs a lot of hip movements!  He said he is also a huge fan of Shakira because of her environmental campaigning and asked the pop star to be a member of his Earthshot Prize Council. Prince William said at the time: Shakira was my number one person on the list.

He said the single, released by the Australian rock band in , is his best tonic to begin a new working week. He said: Thereaposs nothing better than, on a Monday morning, when youaposre a bit bleary-eyed after the weekend and trying to get yourself back into the grind of the week, listening to AC DC - Thunderstruck. It absolutely wakes you up, puts your week in the best mood possible, and you feel like you can take on anything and anyone. William added: I’d imagine you’re going to walk quite fast listening to it, maybe with a skip in your step, with the head-banging. It’s a dficult song not to dance to or to nod along to.

Penny Ibbott, , set off on a six-week bus journey around the country from the centre of the south coast travelling anti-clockwise. The gran-of-four caught the number  bus towards the east coast using her free personieraposs pass and begun her m mammoth journey. Penny would spend at least eight hours travelling on dferent buses to reach her next bed and breakfast. Her route took her to Berwick-upon-Tweed at the top of England, where she travelled along the Scottish border, down the west coast to Lands End, before ing home. The penultimate leg was from Portsmouth to Chidham via Havant where her family and friends were waiting for her in a vintage, open top bus to finish the final  miles home. Penn started her nearly-free adventure around the edge of England in March , but had to head home after ten days when the UK entered its first lockdown. Her second attempt saw her raise £, for St Wilfridaposs Hospice in West Sussex, who looked after her husband Geoff, , who suffered with cancer before he died in . Penny from, Westbourne, West Sussex said: This is something Iaposd been planning to do for a very long time. Just before the pandemic hit I started my adventure and travelled west instead of east.  Iaposd reached Shrewsbury when Boris announced we were going into lockdown and I was forced tohome - it was so disappointing. But I didnapost lose hope, and, almost  months later to the day, I set off again - this time raising money for St Wilfridaposs Hospice who looked after Geoff before he died. The entire journey took five weeks and five days, and, in that time, I met a lot of very interesting and kind people. Iaposm pretty robust but I needed a comfortable bed to sleep in along the way, and as you can imagine choosing the bed and breakfasts was a bit of a lottery. I managed to use my pensioners pass for every English bus free of charge - but on the Scottish side of the border it wasnapost valid, so I had to pay a handful of times.  Often it was like an administrative exercise because when I was on the bus I was always busy doing something. Iaposd be booking my next hotel, answering emails, contacting local press, finding out the route for the day or documenting my journey - all of which took up a lot of my day. My favourite leg of the journey was definitely from Minehead to Lynmouth in Devon because the scenery was just breath-taking. Penny began on September  and finished on October , riding a total of approximately  buses Although she travelled solo, her son Robin, , helped her plan her journey stop by stop and piecing together her coastal route. Prior to her trip sheaposd also contacted Collin Ashcroft, an operations manager at Stage Coach, who was always on hand to offer his expert travel advice. Collin kept track of Penny on her travels and invited her friends and family to surprise her on the final leg of her trip. He then organised a vintage, open top bus to drive Penny and her loved ones back to the exact stop sheaposd set off from six weeks earlier. Penny, who volunteers at St Wilfridaposs charity shop, said: At points it was quite unnerving when I couldn’t find a bus station or anywhere to stay. I had Robin’s notes to hand but even though they were very thorough I still sometimes got confused. There were times when I’d miss a bus and it would send me into a sort of spin because I had to travel an awfully long way. But, with the help of Robin and Collin, I managed to work it out - I canapost imagine the journey without their support. It was so surreal getting the bus on the last leg of my trip, and when I arrived all my loved ones had turned out to meet me. They were on this green, vintage, open top bus which Collin had organised, and my grandkids were there with welcome home signs. It was such a lovely moment, and Collin then drove the bus the final few miles to where it all started - and I finished the journey surrounded by my friends and family. I had the best time and Iaposm truly grateful to have had such a wonderful experience whilst raising money for a cause so close to my heart!

I didnapost want to cause him problems or depreciate the value of his property by sharing access, so I created a new access point. Jamie applied to Natural Resources Walesfor the right to tip hardcore to level the field, which he described as a flytipping hotspot disused for decades.He said: The land had been all overgrown and I cut it back. It was a bog, a hell of a mess, with a bit of a stream going down the side. There were tyres and fridges and dead animals and rats. You name it, it was there. I must have taken  dumped tyres away. NRW granted an exemption for the dad to use waste materials in construction. He started tipping hardcore and rubble to build a driveway and hardstanding for the scaffolding yard, with a layer of crushed stone on top to make it tidy. In September , the access was in place but Jamie was still laying the yardaposs surface. He says he was then visited by representatives of Carmarthenshire Council and NRW. He said: It panicked me a bit. They were saying their biggest concern was the access. I asked what I needed to do. They said I needed planning permission for access but didnapost mention anything about [tipping for the surface of the yard].  I had lorries coming in and tipping rubble at the time. They could see we were tipping that day and didnapost say anything about it. There was no stop notice for the tipping. He put in a retrospective planning application for the access but says he did not hear from the council until March  telling him he had to block the access, remove the scaffolding and get rid of everything . Jamie appealed but it was rejected. He said: The price to remove all the hardcore will be around £,. Firms are afraid of damaging the road so Iaposm struggling to find anyone to remove it.  The planning inspectorate has said it canapost take personal circumstances into consideration because Iaposve broken planning law which I didnapost know about. Iaposm worried Iaposm going to have bailfs on my door. If it comes to it Iaposm going to have to sell all my equipment to pay for removal. He is now worried about how this affects the future of his children, eight-year-old Jake, four-year-old Thea and two-year-old Indi. The planning inspectorate explained its decision to reject Jamieaposs appeal, writing in its report that the development has signicantly altered and harmed the rural character and appearance of the immediate area. The report also raises safety concerns. It says the access is not perpendicular to the main road, adding: The visibility in both directions from the access is restricted and it is likely that vehicles exiting the site would have to edge out onto the highway to gain visibility. NRW confirmed its waste regulation team had been in regular contact with Jamie up to the work becoming a planning issue which was then led by the council. Senior waste regulation officer David Ellar said: Mr Fuller did not have a permit for this work, he had registered an exemption with NRW. Exemptions are for low-risk waste operations that are exempt from needing an environmental permit but still require the holder to operate within specied limits and conditions. Registering an exemption does not remove the need to apply for other permits or permissions. Waste exemptions must be registered with us before the activity commences. “We de-registered Mr Fuller’s exemption when planning permission was refused by the planning authority at Carmarthenshire Council as the activity was not authorised.” A council spokeswoman added: Before anyone starts a development of any type we strongly recommend that they contact the local planning authority so that they can be advised of what permissions may be required. Having a permit from another body for depositing waste materials on a site does not constitute planning permission.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON property news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His father Thomas Hughes and stepmother Emma Tustin have been jailed this week. Today, a large crowd gathered in Solihull, West Midlands, releasing balloons for Arthur.Everyone present then started applauding after standing in silence to remember the child, Birmingham Live reports.The gathering was organised by Kerry Vines, a resident of Cranmore Road, where Arthur lost his le, who said: Itaposs about showing Arthur that we are all thinking of him, and he was a very loved little boy. It will also be a celebration of his le. He finally got the justice he deserved.  Arthuraposs maternal grandmother Madeleine Halcrow could be seen wiping away tears at the vigil while wearing a T-shirt bearing his face. The crowd lined the road before letting go of the balloons, some bearing messages, and applauding. Residents, some with tears in their eyes, could be heard saying bye Arthur and fly high always. They then formed a line outside the house before balloons, posters and flowers were placed around the property. The words You are loved Arthur were put on the boarded-up window.  A Birmingham City flag was also placed at the scene, along with a picture of Arthur. It comes as the Government confirmed a major review into the circumstances which led to the murder of Arthur. It aims to determine what improvements are needed by the agencies that came into contact with the child in the months before he was murdered by stepmother Emma Tustin at their home in Solihull. The National Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel will lead the review and will provide additional support to Solihull Childrenaposs Safeguarding Partnership to upgrade the already existing local review which was launched shortly after Arthuraposs death in June .  The action comes after it emerged in court the boy had been seen by social workers just two months before his death, but they concluded there were no safeguarding concerns. Tustin, , was jailed for le at Coventry Crown Court on Friday, with a minimum term of  years, after being found guilty of his murder, while his father, Thomas Hughes, , was sentenced to  years for manslaughter. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: Arthuraposs murder has shocked and appalled the nation.  I am deeply distressed by this awful case and the senseless pain inflicted on this poor boy, who has been robbed of the chance to live his le. I have taken immediate action and asked for a joint inspection to consider where improvements are needed by all the agencies tasked with protecting children in Solihull, so that we can be assured that we are doing everything in our power to protect other children and prevent such evil crimes. Given the enormity of this case, the range of agencies involved and the potential for its implications to be felt nationally, I have also asked Annie Hudson, chair of the Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel, to work with leaders in Solihull to deliver a single, national review of Arthuraposs death to identy where we must learn from this terrible case. We are determined to protect children from harm and where concerns are raised we will not hesitate to take urgent and robust action. We will not rest until we have the answers we need. The Childrenaposs Commissioner for England added the voices of children must be listened to in the wake of Arthuraposs murder. Dame Rachel de Souza said more must be done to support social workers to spot similar cases, but the coronavirus lockdown has weakened the system. She told BBC Oneaposs The Andrew Marr Show: First, I think itaposs so important weaposre here talking about Arthuraposs case. The le of a child is of inestimable value and his voice was not heard and thataposs where we need to start.Obviously, thereaposs a serious case review underway and we need to see what that says but we must take decisive action and now.  Now, my concern is that here we are  years since this post was set up and weaposre still having these cases and there are two things that I think we absolutely have to do and do now. One, Arthur raised concerns, he was not a baby, he was six years old, he raised concerns and the system did not hear him. We must listen to the voices of children and secondly, no doubt with these reviews and national reviews that are absolutely right that they happen, they tend to make the same recommendations. Itaposs not a matter of system recommendations, itaposs a matter of delivery.

Anita Bentonaposs face swelled dramatically and her skin erupted in a red, lumpy rash after dying her hair using the Schwarzkopf product last month, she has claimed. The -year-old said she was temporarily blinded for four days and fears sheaposll have permanent eyelid damage after suffering a severe allergic reaction to the Schwarzkopf Live dye in shade Cosmic Blue. Anita thought she wouldnapost need a patch test as she has used the product every six to eight weeks since  with no problems. But just  minutes after applying the dye on October , the mum-of-three claims her scalp started aposburningapos.  The following day it was weeping so much her hair aposstuck to her headapos. Over the next two days her Anitaaposs ballooned, swelling so much so her eyelids closed over, leaving her unable to see and forcing her to take a week off work. Anitaaposs concerned boss asked for pictures of her medication to prove she was having an allergic reaction and wasnapost the victim of a vicious beating - while even her own dad didnapost recognise her. A Schwarzkopf spokesman said they have offered expert help to identy the cause of her reaction and urge everyone to an allergy alert test before using hair colour. Anita, from Sheldon, West Midlands, said: I looked like Elephant Man. I took a selfie and sent it to my dad and he replied aposwhoaposs that apos. Even my own dad couldnapost recognise me. My manager asked me to send her pictures of my medication to prove I hadnapost been beaten up and that it was actually an allergic reaction. Iaposm never dying my hair again, Iaposm going to go grey gracefully.  Anita was refreshing her hair colour using the dye in Cosmic Blue - a blue black shade sheaposd previously used with no problem. However, just  minutes after putting the product on her hair her scalp started burning so she washed it off. That evening her head started to itch and weep and she was unable to sleep due to the discomfort. Over the next two days her face ballooned, her eyes closed over and her head started to itch and weep. Anita called her GP at am on Monday, October th who suggested she go to Birmingham Midland Eye Centre. There, doctors ran tests and referred her to Heartlands Hospitalaposs AE department in Birmingham, West Midlands, where she was prescribed steroids and antibiotics. Days later the swelling started to subside but then Anita broke out in a lumpy, itchy rash that required another two lots of steroids, steroid cream and stronger antihistamines.  Anita said: Iaposve naturally dark hair, I had a few greys coming through so I thought aposright letaposs sort those greys outapos. Iaposve been using the same hair dye since  and never had any problems. I donapost patch test every time, I just did it on the first one. You usually leave your hair dye on for half an hour, as per the instructions, I had it on  minutes and I could feel this burning and tingling feeling. Then the burning just got too much so I washed it off. On Sunday morning I woke up and all my hair was stuck to my head because it had been weeping throughout the night. Later in the night there was a little bit of swelling by my left temple. I didnapost manage to sleep that night, the stuff weeping out of my scalp was running down my face and it was so itchy, I was dying to scratch it. I phoned my GP, he asked me to send some photos and because my eyes were swollen he told me to go to the eye hospital. When I got outside the hospital I could feel both my eyes swelling up that much that they were closing. They put loads of drops in my eyes, said there was no problem with them, and said I needed to go to AE. As soon as the doctor there saw me he said straightaway aposhair dyeapos. He gave me steroids and antibiotics and told me to buy some Piriton to relieve the itching. Both of my eyes completely closed, I could only open my eyes on Thursday.  The swelling went from my eyes and dropped down into my cheeks so I looked like a hamster, then my skin broke out in a rash all over. There were bumps underneath my skin, it was that itchy I was ripping myself to pieces. I went back to the doctor and he said I had a skin infection and I had another two lots of steroids and stronger antihistamines and some steroid cream. All in all I had eight or nine dferent medications and I pay for my prescriptions. While in hospital waiting to be seen, Anita contacted Schwarzkopf in a bid to get to the bottom of what had triggered her reaction. Anita says she was told a aposminor change to the perfume ingredientapos had been made and the hair giant have also offered to pay for dermatological testing. After finishing her course of antibiotics, Anita is now fully recovered apart from a aposbaggyapos left eyelid that she hopes will go back to normal in due course. Anita said: Iaposm fully recovered and back to normal now. Where it swelled up my eyelid hasnapost gone back to normal, itaposs a bit baggier than it was, but I just keep putting on loads of cream and hoping for the best. I want to raise awareness because a lot of women like myself donapost do patch tests purely because weaposve been using the same hair dye for years and years. These companies change their products all of the time, all they need to do is put a little sticker on that says aposnew and improved, please re-do your patch testapos. A Schwarzkopf spokesperson said: We were sorry to hear about Anita Bentonaposs experience and wish her a speedy recovery. She has been in contact with us and we have offered expert help to identy the cause of her reaction. We urge everyone to read the instructions and do an allergy alert test before using hair colour, eventhey have used the brand or specic colour before, as allergies can build up over time.

She said: It was like something out of a Hollywood film, and after I had got over the shock I just assumed that someone would realise that they had made a huge mistake and that they would swtly take the money back.  But no one did, and the money just sat in my account.”With the money still in her account, Peters contacted thenewspaper because she wanted tothe enormous sum.Peters said: I assumed that HMRC staff would notice their mistake when I paid my tax in November , but nothing happened. “I even tried to ring HMRC but getting hold of anyone at the time was impossible. I’d wait  minutes on the phone and then would have to give up as my child would need to be fed, or something.  “On other calls, I would be cut off before I could talk to someone. I moved £, into my savings account but it has earned virtually no interest. I have never been wealthy and don’t have a car or even a dog. My income had been decimated and all the time I was very gently eating into the money. But because I could no longer pay the whole sum back I was stuck in a catch- position. I had a whole load of money I knew I couldn’t spend, but I was unable to do anything about it in case HMRC wanted it all back at once.” After trying to get advice from a few people, she was met with ied words of wisdom.  Some told her to do nothing with the money while others advised her to invest it in shares or property, hoping no one would ask for the money back. Out of desperation to recover the money she spent, Peters considered investing the cash into cryptocurrency.discovered that HMRC staff made the payment by accident after trying to pay Peters a £. parcel customs duty rebate. Had she never came forward, thereaposs a good chance the payment would never have been discovered. Upon discovering the mistake, HMRC brought up a case on behalf of Section A of the Theft Act . The law states that keeping wrongful credit and not taking reasonable steps to cancel the credit is unlawful. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to the inidual, a HMRC spokesperson said. We are working to recover the payment that was made. For the amount that the inidual spent, we will work with them to come to a payment arrangement that takes into account their financial circumstances.

Katie Dean says there have been problems since they moved into the house in Hull in September . Images from inside show plaster peeling off walls, a hole in one ceiling, as well as extensive damp and mould. The mum claims that her -year-old daughter moved out because she was too embarrassed to live there.Katie, who lives in the house with her partner, toddler child and with a baby on the way, told HullLive: Itaposs not liveable. My key worker from Target Housing has been and Iaposve told him I want moving out of the property, itaposs seriously affecting my mental health. My -year-old has moved out of the house to live with her dad, partly because it was too embarrassing to bring people around. She is also worried about her toddler, who she claims is getting chest infections. Katie, who is in her s, said Target Housing has responded to her and that some repairs have been attempted. The repairs included the replacement of a boiler  days after the previous version packed up, the fitting of a dormer window, an extractor fan and a new radiator installed in the bathroom.  However, Katie claims itaposs barely scratched the surface of all the houseaposs signicant issues. She says that work to insulate the roof and prevent a leak in the attic had not been effective. She said: Weaposve actually now found that it is still leaking and the roof is all damp and wet. Itaposs disgusting - itaposs actually growing mould on it and I canapost get rid of it.  I had a new window fitted, a new dormer window, thataposs brilliant. But the mould above it must be because of a leak and itaposs like growing. Katie claims a new radiator that was fitted in the bathroom led to signicant damage to the wall beside it, which she was still waiting for to be repaired. She further claimed that the issues with the houseaposs living room - damp walls, the adjacent hallway wall falling through and being too cold - are so extensive that the family had effectively abandoned using it.  She said: I mean, my living room was beautul. I adore ornaments because thataposs what Iaposm into. And I canapost use none of it because it would just end up on the floor smashed and broken because of the walls and things. She added: This was only to be temporary until I got my money, finances, things like that, sorted out.  She added they were moved in with the assistance of Target Housing and were paying back prior rent arrears to the council. Members of Hull City Councilaposs environmental health team have also visited the property two times, Katie said. She added: Andthey canapost work around us doing that, then move us out.

Critics say it undermines Charles’ Cop proclamation last month when he told the world: “We have to reduce emissions urgently. “We have to put ourselves on what might be called a war-like footing. We know what we must do.” The heir to the throne could have reduced his own impact on the planet by taking his electric vehicle to the Voyager aircraft’s usual home, RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Instead it was flown to RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, nearer Sandringham, ahead of Charles’ trip for a ceremony removing the Queen as head of state. It saved him just two hours of driving time. Graham Smith of campaign group Republic accused Charles of “staggering hypocrisy” and called the flight a waste of taxpayers’ money and RAF resources. Matt Finch, of Transport  Environment, added: “For long distances we can’t avoid air travel, but for domestic travel, anyone should avoid flying and use other forms of transport.”  Charles, who has previously urged all of his staff to cycle to work, has championed the use of biofuels blended with normal aviation fuel as a transitional step towards creating carbon-free flight. The voyager, an Airbus A also used by senior Government ministers, is the first RAF plane to run on the “sustainable” option, but critics say it is still very harmful to the environment. Manufacturers claim it can cut a plane’s carbon emissions by up to  per cent, over its le cycle. But it is mixed with conventional jet fuel and scientists are unclear on how green it is. The prince is often driven to royal engagements in an all-electric Jaguar I-Pace SUV. And he also owns an Aston Martin DB, which he has said is powered by “surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process”. Last month, Charles spoke of his passion for environmental issues during Cop in Glasgow and said world leaders need to do more than “just talk”, as he admitted he himself had been doing for the past  years. Today a Clarence House spokesman said: “The prince has campaigned for a sht towards sustainable aviation fuel as air travel is a crucial part of his work. “As a result, this autumn the RAF introduced for the first time sustainable fuel and deployed it for this trip.

In a rare interview in , Angela Kelly even ulged that the Queen mimics her Liverpudlian accent. She said: We have a lot of fun together. The Queen has a wicked sense of humour and is a great mimic.She can do all accents — including mine.  Angela, who was the daughter of a dockworker in Liverpool, was given The Queenaposs support for her tell-all book - The Other Side of The Coin: The Queen, The Dresser and the Wardrobe. The decision to support the book is unprecedented, proving just how highly regarded she is by the Queen.After starting in  as a dresser, Angela is now solely responsible for how Her Majesty looks in public and has even made several of her most memorable looks.

And who knows, maybe Angela is busy at work making some outfits for the Queen to wear this Christmas Thataposs because the monarch has told her family she is well enough to host Christmas at Sandringham this month after recovering from a back sprain. The -year-old assured them she is feeling “far better” and is “looking forward” to the traditional festive get together at her Norfolk estate.  Concern for the Queen’s health has been heightened in recent weeks after she pulled out of a number of major engagements. But a source said: “The Queen has told everyone she is feeling far better of late and is very much looking forward to welcoming them for Christmas. “Like many other families, this will be the first time Her Majesty can gather with her extended family after being kept apart for so long due to the coronavirus pandemic.” Royal fans will be hoping toto the estate on Christmas Day to catch a glimpse of the royals as they walk en masse to and from the th Century St Mary Magdalene Church on the Sandringham property. The Queen is said to be “determined” to attend church with the rest of the family, but will as in previous years be driven to the church to save her walking the short distance.Christmas guests will include Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children.

However, six months on, the café on Boscow Road in Little Lever, Bolton, Greater Manchester, has many five-star reviews and is loved by the local community.Liz told the Manchester Evening News : Itaposs been really, really positive. Thereaposs nothing like us in the area here.Itaposs something Iaposve always wanted to do. Liz opened Walk This Way Café after she was forced to give up her job during lockdown and stay at home. Her -year-old daughter, who has autism, was sent home from her school before mainstream schools followed suit in a move to protect the most vulnerable children. Because she needed to be at home to look after her daughter, Liz started thinking about opening a café. Liz said: I like being a bit dferent.  Her husband Alan built the shop front and now the café is popular not only with locals, but also with passers-by. Liz said her new business venture has also helped her become closer to the local community. Walk this Way offers sandwiches, hot and cold drinks, chocolates, crisps, and ice lollies - all at affordable prices. I offer a service that I would expect myself, Liz said.A review on Google reads: Fantastic little gem of a cafe, with very friendly and helpful owners. Nothing is too much trouble for them, nice little pit stop during a walk.Love the hot chocolate, will definitely be back, also child and dog friendly. Thank you Alan and Liz for making us feel welcomed and for making our walk much brighter. Another person said: Fab little cafe. Stopped off on a group bike ride today, and got a lovely welcome, nice coffee, and delicious gluten free cookie. One more added: Wow, what a find. Weaposve been walking in this area for years and always thought there should be some refreshments in this area, well now there is.Over the summer, the Walk This Way was open from Monday to Sunday. It now opens its doors on weekends and on some days during the school holidays.

This week Emma Tustin, , was sentenced to le with a minimum term of  years for killing her six-year-old step-son. While in remand during the trial, she shared a cell with a prisoner called Elaine for six weeks at Eastwood Park prison, Gloucestershire. The former cellmate claimed that the murderous step-mum never once mentioned Arthur or his death. Arthuraposs father, Thomas Hughes, , was sentenced to  years for manslaughter - but Tustin was said to have been upset that he was cold to her during their trial. “She always felt sorry for herself, Elaine told the Sunday Mirror.  One day she came back from a plea hearing and was upset, so I asked, ‘What’s wrong ’ “She said, ‘He didn’t look at me, Tom never looked at me’. That was the only time I saw her upset about anything.” Elaine had been recalled to jail for battery and criminal damage. She said Tustin used to “laugh and joke” on the phone.  Elaine claimed the mum of four told her own mother she would never see her grandchildren again unless she retracted statements about Arthur. She only discovered the truth about the charges Tustin was facing when she found and read her case paperwork. “We had a fight – it was me more than her. I got angry because I’d read about how he [Arthur] had  bruises and I asked how she wouldn’t notice when she gave him a bath, she added. “She said she just used to give him a towel.  “I pressed the bell and saidthe prison officers didn’t get her out then I’d be staying there a long time.” Tustin was moved to a dferent cell. But Elaine said after inmates learned how Tustin poisoned Arthur with salt, they laced her meals with it. She said: “Some of the things we did were cruel – but she was crueller to Arthur so she deserved it.”  Today dozens of residents paid a touching tribute to Arthur outside the house in Solihull where he was killed. Organised by a local resident, the vigil saw people laying flowers, holding balloons and placing posters and banners paying tribute to Arthur at the property. His maternal grandmother Madeleine Halcrow could be seen wiping away tears at the vigil while wearing a T-shirt bearing his face. The crowd lined the road before letting go of the balloons, some bearing messages, and applauding. Residents, some with tears in their eyes, could be heard saying bye Arthur and fly high always. They then formed a line outside the house before balloons, posters and flowers were placed around the property.  The words You are loved Arthur were put on the boarded-up window. A Birmingham City flag was also placed at the scene, along with a picture of Arthur. The Government has announced a major review into the circumstances which led to the murder, aiming to determine what improvements are needed by the agencies that came into contact with Arthur before his death. The National Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel will lead the review and will provide additional support to Solihull Childrenaposs Safeguarding Partnership. It emerged in court the boy had been seen by social workers just two months before his death, but they concluded there were no safeguarding concerns.

Changes were also made last week to day two tests, requiring people to complete a PCR and isolate until they have a negative result back. The HSA said that as of Saturday a further  cases of the Omicron iant have been reported across the UK -  of them in England. It takes the total number of confirmed cases of the iant in the UK to . The Mirror has explained the latest changes to the travel rules.  Pre departure tests From am on Tuesday, anyone travelling to the UK from countries not on the red list will be required to take a pre-departure test a maximum of  hours before leaving, regardless of their vaccination status. Ministers said it was intended to be a temporary measure following new data showing an increase in the number of cases of the new strain linked to foreign travel. The move, which will be introduced on Tuesday, was welcomed by Labour which has been pressing for theof pre-departure tests since the iant was first identied in South Africa. But the party criticised the Government for not acting sooner. It means passengers travelling to the UK will have to take either a PCR or a lateral flow test up to a maximum of  hours before they depart regardless of their vaccination status.  We have always said we would act swtlywe need tothe changing data requires it, Mr Javid said. These are temporary measures we want to remove them as soon as we possibly can, but before we learn more about Omicron it is right that we have these measures in place. The Department of Health and Social Caresaid it had acted in part because said new analysis by the UK Health and Security Agencysuggested the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron iant. Day two tests upon arrival to the UK Last week, the introduction of compulsory PCR tests for Covid- for everyone arriving in the UK was announced. It was announced that all vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK must take a day  PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. The test can be taken on or before day two.  Under the previous rules, vaccinated arrivals simply needed a PCR or lateral flow test on day two. Under the new rules which have come into force, you will need to self-isolate for the first two days back in the UK. On day two, you will need to take a PCR test - andthe result is negative, you will be allowed to end your self-isolation. As for travellers who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, existing rules continue to apply. This means thatyou are ing from non-red list country, then you will need to take a pre-departure test and self-isolate at home for  days during which you need to take PCR tests on days two and eight. Countries on the red list Last week it was announced that the following countries have been added to the red list: Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Nigeria was also added to the Governmentaposs travel red list. From am on Monday, only British and Irish nationals travelling from the country will be allowed into the UK and must isolate in a Government-managed quarantine hotel for  days. UK arrivals ing from red list countries are required to stay in a quarantine hotel for  nights, with costs of up to £, per adult. The developing situation is unsurprisingly causing some concern amongst Brits who have booked holidays in the coming weeks.  Industry reaction The travel sector said theof pre-departure tests was another hammer blow for an industry which was just beginning to pick up again after the devastation wrought by the pandemic. Clive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, said it directly contradicted assurances given by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and he called on the Government to step in and support the sector. The introduction of pre-departure testing with little warning is a hammer blow to the business travel industry, he said. Public safety is a priority, but businesses will fail, travellers will be stranded and livelihoods devastated by the lack of coherent plans from Government. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said the rapidly changing measures meant planning was becoming impossible. It is premature to hit millions of passengers and industry before we see the full data. We donapost have the clinical evidence, he said. These measures must be removed as quickly as possible in line with the speed of the booster programme.

She was later branded dishonest by a judgeSwimmers take on the  Great North Swim in Lake WindermereImage: newcastle chronicleByNeal Keeling:,  Dec | commentsA woman who tried to sue her GP for £, for damages after they missed a breast cancer diagnosis has been branded dishonest by a judge. Sara Iddon attended an appointment with Dr Karen Warner in January  and complained about a lump in her left breast, a court heard.The GP recorded there was no discrete lump and reassured the woman, the Manchester Evening News reports.Eight months later, the woman from Preston, Lancashire, had another appointment at the same medical practice but with a dferent doctor, saying she noticed a change in the shape of her left breast. After having a mammogram, Mrs Iddon was diagnosed with breast cancer and on December , she had surgery and breast reconstruction.  Later, the woman had chemotherapy and radiotherapy and between December  and October , she underwent lipo modelling of her reconstructed left breast. In June , Mrs Iddon made a claim of damages for £, saying she had suffered avoidable pain, loss of amenity, and reduced movement in her left arm. In September , a consultant psychologist saw Mrs Iddon and wrote: She no longer runs but does try to swim a bit in the swimming pool. However this is not anywhere near the level she was at prior to the alleged negligence...she used to swim for miles. In November that year, a consultant in pain medicine examined her and recorded: The pain is constant, severe, agonising, aching, sharp, throbbing, tingling, and horrible in character. He added: Mrs Iddon was fit and she used to run four times a week as well as she had training for a half marathon that she took part in. She used to swim in open waters as well as take her dog for a walk. She cannot do these leisure activities now because of a lack of fitness and tiredness. However, Manchester High Court heard Mrs Iddon had taken part in a nighttime open water swim the month before. By December , Mrs Iddon had increased her damages claim to £, alleging she was suffering from severe chronic post-surgical pain and associated dysesthesia and numbness in the left chest wall, left shoulder arm ad both hips causing severe disability, fatigue, and psychological injury. In May , Mrs Iddon served a total claim of £,, including for loss of past and future earnings and care. On July , , Dr Warner made an open admission of liability and a district judge ordered the defendant to make an interim payment of £,. However, despite admitting breach of duty, the GP later alleged that Mrs Iddonaposs claim should be dismissed because she had been fundamentally dishonest in relation to the claim, and the judge agreed.An intelligence analyst, Mr Richard Vaughan, said that on September , , Chris Barnes, Mrs Iddonaposs brother, posted on Facebook : Sara is not a victim but a fighter carrying on with her le running and swimming like she did before. In addition, it was revealed that on November , , Sara Iddon posted on Facebook: Fantastic night swim with Christine, Swimease   , brilliantly organised and really good fun.A Google search revealed that Sara Iddon finished th in the Great North Swimrun  which took place on June ,  and that she and Andrew Iddon finished th and st in the Great Scottish Swim Aquathon which took place on August , .Mrs Iddon first denied she had taken part in any events, but later admitted it. She stated that she acquired CBD hemp oil and a substance she believed to be cannabis oil to cope with the effects of breast cancer. She claimed that with the aid of these substances, she was able to participate in eight sporting events. In a new court statement, Mrs Iddon failed to mention she had taken part in another event - a k run on May ,  at Worden Park. In his judgement, HHJ Sephton, said he found that Mrs Iddon deliberately omitted to refer to the Worden Park run as she thought she had got away with not revealing it. He also added: I reject the submission that the consumption of either hemp oil or cannabis oil had any effect at all on Mrs Iddon’s performance in the sporting events in which she took part. I find that when she took part in those sporting events, she performed without the aid of these substances. He said: I conclude that, by the incomplete or frankly misleading accounts Mrs Iddon gave to the medical experts, she intended to mislead the court about her capabilities. By the standards of ordinary decent people, her actions were dishonest. What is more, I believe that Mrs Iddon knew that they were dishonest. The effect of her lies was to seek to inflate the value of a case which I have held to be worth just over £, into a case worth over £,. I regard Mrs Iddon’s dishonesty in this case to be very grave. She lied repeatedly about her injuries, she continued to lie after she had been found out and, most seriously, she persuaded others to lie on her behalf. Mrs Iddon suffered serious and distressing consequences because of the defendant’s breach of duty. Regrettably, she lied about how serious her condition was, and persuaded others to lie to support her account. I feel unable to rely on Mrs Iddon’s evidence I have been forced to look to other sources of information. It may be that the evidence I feel able to rely on is incomplete so that some of the losses Mrs Iddon suffered have not been taken into account. If that is so, she only has herself to blame. I conclude that Mrs Iddon has been fundamentally dishonest in relation to her claim. I am not persuaded that she would suffer substantial injusticeI were to dismiss her claim. I record that, but for the dismissal of her claim, I would have awarded Mrs Iddon £,.. Mrs Iddon used the interim payment to buy a house, but may now be forced to repay it.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Breast cancerCourt caseSwimming poolsFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The alleged trips reportedly included flights to and from Epsteinaposs private Caribbean island, Little St James. Flight records seen by the Mail on Sunday suggest Prince Andrewaposs first flight on board Epsteinaposs black Gulfstream II jet was to the billionaireaposs private Caribbean island in the US Virgin Islands on February , . According to the flight logs, Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and one of the Dukeaposs personal protection officers were also on board. They landed at Cyril E King Airport on the island of St Thomas then were shuttled to Little St James on one of Epsteinaposs helicopters, reports say.But The Daily Mail says a source close to the Prince reportedly said in  that the Duke has aposno recollectionapos of being on the  flight. Little St James is now known as apospaedophile islandapos because of the horric abuse that took place there. It has been reported before that Prince Andrew visited the island, but he insists he never saw anything untoward. The flight logs allegedly show that after spending three nights on the island, Prince Andrew went to West Palm Beach where Epstein owned a £ million home. It is claimed the records also show he flew on Epsteinaposs Gulfstream from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to West Palm Beach on May , . And it is alleged that Prince Andrew took a flight on the plane from London Luton to Edinburgh on September ,  – six weeks after Epstein was arrested for sex offences.  The private jet has been described as having thick burgundy carpets, leather executive chairs and a gourmet chef on board. Guests were said to be given dishes including Wagyu beef steak and caviar blinis as well as vintage Cristal champagne. The claims come after a court earlier heard that a woman who has accused Ghislaine Maxwell of grooming her to be abused by paedophile Jeffrey Epstein once took a flight with Prince Andrew. The victim, known in court as “Jane’, was asked about her time on board the late billionaire’s private jet nicknamed the ‘Lolita Expressapos. Cross-examined by defence counsel for Maxwell during the British socialiteaposs sex abuse case, attorney Laura Menninger said: “Do you remember Prince Andrew being on a flight with you ” Jane, whose identity is protected, replied: “Yes”.  The testimony which came earlier this month is the first time an alleged victim who witnessed the Duke of York, , on an Epstein flight has appeared before a jury. The flight, which aposJaneapos is listed as being on board with Andrew was when she -years-old flying from the billionaireaposs ranch in New Mexico to his home in Palm Beach. The Duke has been under fire for his close ties to the late paedophile, who committed suicide in August  as he awaited trial for sex trafficking. Andrew is also facing a lawsuit from Virginia Giuffre, who claims Epstein and Maxwell made her have sex with the UK royal three times, starting in  when she was . The royal has emphatically denied the allegations and any wrongdoing. The Mirror has contacted a representative for Prince Andrew for comment.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyPrivate jetsCrimeBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She had even added a heart-eyed emoji. It was good to see Sydney happy. Her loved ones knew she’d struggled with depression, but she was always trying to stay positive. A tattoo on her arm read, “Everything will be wonderful someday.” And her new romance was making her feel hopeful. It was  November  and Sydney lived in Lincoln, Nebraska, where she worked as a cashier at a hardware store. Her parents, George and Susie, lived three hours away, but they would get together as often as they could and messaged each other constantly. Sydney had told her friends that she’d met a woman called Audrey on Tinder. She’d even shared Audrey’s picture with them. She had been on one date with Audrey two days earlier – where they had simply driven around getting to know each other. Now it was time for the second date and she headed out.  But the next morning, Sydney didn’t turn up for work. She wasn’t ing messages from her parents, so they got in their car and drove straight to her apartment. They found Sydney’s cat Mimzy hungry and abandoned and knew something bad had happened. Sydney would never have neglected her cat. Her car was still there and her mobile was turned off. They filed a missing person’s report with the police. The last time her phone was on, it was in Wilber – about  miles away. Fears were that Sydney had been abducted and her parents made an emotional public plea for her safe . Investigators focused on Sydney’s date, Audrey, and tracked down her phone number after linking with her on Tinder. The woman who answered admitted going on a date with Sydney, but said she’d left her at a friend’s house afterwards. She couldn’t recall where that was. Police noted that Audrey was reluctant to share basic details about herself. Eventually, officers discovered that “Audrey” was a woman called Bailey Boswell, then . She lived with her older boyfriend Aubrey Trail, then , in Wilber. They were both named as persons of interest. Boswell had been using a dferent mobile to send messages to Sydney and that phone, as well as Trail’s and Sydney’s, led the police to a location  miles west of Wilber. There, on  December, Sydney’s body was found. Her dismembered remains were stuffed in rubbish bags in ditches in a field near Omaha.  Sydney’s body had been cut up into  pieces – some of her organs and body parts were never found. The cause of death was suffocation and she had put up a fight in her final moments. Her earlobe was torn and she had bruising on her wrists, the back of the head and her inner thighs. She’d clearly been restrained before she was deprived of air. Investigators were certain that Boswell and Trail were involved. They turned out to be a very disturbing couple. Boswell had met Trail when he answered her online advert for massages. She had a young daughter who she had lost custody of. Trail and Boswell had a lot in common – including dark fantasies. They moved into a basement flat together in Wilber in June  and started defrauding antiques dealers. The pair enjoyed group sex with other women, who they met through Tinder. Trail told them stories about “gaining power” from killing people. Police determined that Boswell had lured Sydney into a trap and she had been murdered. There was even surveillance footage of Trail and Boswell out before Sydney’s date, where they bought tools and bleach. The pair were arrested in June  and charged with Sydney’s murder. Right from the start, Trail was a liar. He told a newspaper that Sydney had agreed to be part of a sexual fantasy with him and two other women, while Boswell was passed out on drugs in another room. It had got rough and something had become tight around Sydney’s neck. Trail also told his lawyers that he’d had a “sex party” with just Boswell and Sydney. They had all had sex but while Sydney was handcuffed, he had choked her with an electrical cord and had killed her. But even in the courtroom during the trial in , Trail would change his version of events again. The prosecutors said that the twisted couple had already planned on killing someone before finding Sydney on Tinder. Boswell would connect with the woman after she and Trail picked a target together by looking on social media. Hours before Sydney’s death, Trail and Boswell were buying the tools and supplies used to dismember her. They had even chosen Sydney as she lived  miles away from her family, hoping her disappearance wouldn’t be noticed for a while. They were wrong. Then, during proceedings, Trail grew angry at negative testimony about his girlfriend’s guilt and screamed, “Bailey is innocent and I curse you all!” before using a blade to cut his throat. Trail was taken to hospital and ended up missing most of his own trial. He ed to testy in his defence with scars on his neck. The defence said that Sydney had agreed to be filmed doing “sexual asphyxiation” infor money. But when Trail took to the stand, he shocked his own legal team by admitting that was also a lie. The killer said he had spun stories to confuse the investigators. “It was only me, Bailey and Sydney there the night Sydney died. There were no two other girls there. There was no , paid for a sexual fantasy,” Trail said. He claimed Sydney’s killing wasn’t planned, but she had been lured to the apartment by Boswell and Sydney had “freaked out”. They’d hoped she would join their sex ring and criminal activities. When she resisted, Trail killed and dismembered her with a saw to “protect” their lestyle. And the court were given a horric insight into that lestyle. Three women testied about being lured into Trail and Boswell’s sex cult via Tinder between June  and the November Sydney died. Trail said he was a vampire who could fly and read minds. He and Boswell both alleged they could gain more “powers” by killing people – even morethey tortured them first. The women would have sex with Trail and Boswell in exchange for an allowance. They also helped in the antique business scams. Trail made them call him “Daddy” and he would call Boswell “The Queen Witch”. There were strict rules about staying in touch with Trail and they spoke about being punished. If they broke rules, they would be slapped or even choked with a belt. When one woman left the sex cult, Trail had threatened to kill her familyshe told anyone. The jury took just three hours to deliberate. The couple were both found guilty of first-degree murder, criminal conspiracy to commit murder and improper disposal of human remains.  In June this year, at a sentencing for Trail in front of a three-judge , he gave a statement. He admitted he’d killed Sydney but insisted it wasn’t premeditated. He had killed her because he was worried that Sydney would go to the policehe let her go. “I won’t say I’m sorry, as that would be an insult to you after what I put you through,” Trail said to Sydney’s family. “And I won’t ask for forgiveness as I don’t believe there is such a thing. I have done some terrible things in my le, but this is the only thing I have ever done that I feel real regret about.” The judges said Trail had displayed a “cold, calculated” level of planning, pointing out that he had even bragged about the killing afterwards and joked that he had drunk Sydney’s blood. They said that dismembering her body was needless and done to satisfy his “intellectual and sexual curiosity”. Trail was given the death penalty. At Boswell’s sentencing last month, she also faced the death penalty. She begged for her le to be spared for her “daughter’s sake”. The judges said Sydney had found herself in the killers’ flat, outnumbered and unable to defend herself. “Boswell’s actions and words demonstrate that she had no regard for the le of Sydney Loofe beyond her own pleasure,” one judge said. But one judge didn’t agree on the death penalty, so Boswell was sentenced to le in prison without parole. Her legal team said they would appeal.

Thanks to the oak trees in their back garden, the fallen leaves have given five playful pups a new game to keep them entertained. The stack of leaves is much bigger than them, which means the only way for them to move around is to hop and bounce - and the result is hilarious. If it wasnapost for their thrill-seeking bunny hops, it would be hard to spot the tiny dogs in the leaf pile. Their owner, Mark Trippi, from South Carolina, USA, caught the precious moment on video.  Mark, , said: “They like to watch me blow the leaves in a big pile then they run around and play tag while running through the leaves.” The five pups, named Rusty, Skillet, Sierra, Muffin and Willow can be seen up to their ears in leaves, bouncing towards one another. One of them gives a little bark of excitement while another jumps to urge the others to start another game of chase. Mark says they like to hide in the pile, which isnapost hard due to the size of them. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter. At one point in the video, one or two little corgis disappear into the pile before popping up into sight again. Mark and his we Paula have had corgis for  years and he says the breed like to make everyone happy. The truck service manager added: “It gives us joy to see our corgis having fun and playing together. You will see how they look back at us to seewe are smiling.” The video caught lots of attention on Facebook.One user said: “Leaf bunnies!” Another said “Needles in a haystack  NOOOO... Corgis in a leaf-stack.” Others have commented on how adorable they are and how much it has made them smile.

Shelley Hunt and Peter Verge, from Penticton, Canada, all live together in one big home with their five children, but not in the way that you might think.Mum-of-two Shelley lives in one suite within the home with her children from a previous marriage, while Peter lives in a suite upstairs with his three kids, and in all honesty, it sounds perfect. The couple have been together for a number of years now, and both have joint custody of all five kids on the same schedule, meaning they either have all five kids at once, or none of them, giving them alone time to enjoy as a couple. After previously revealing their unusual living situation, the couple recently took to TikTok to answer all the burning questions people had about their family dynamic. I live on the upper floor, I have three bedrooms for me and my three kids and Shelley is on the main floor with her two. We have our own entrances, thereaposs a door that locks in between, Peter explained. I pay  percent of everything and Shelley pays  and thataposs based on square footage. Iaposm responsibly for my suite, I cook, I clean, and the same thing for Shelly downstairs. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Shelley added: Our suites are really separate so we have our own rooms but we have shared custody on all five of our children on the same schedule, so we either have all five of them or none of them andtheyaposre not here, we open the door and strangely, we sleep in my room, but we use Peteraposs living space aposcause itaposs cooler. Explaining a little bit about how they came to be in that situation, Shelley explained that they were both looking to get onto the property ladder very early in their relationship, so it made financial sense to buy together, while still maintaining some separation for the sake of their children. Despite things being a little unorthodox, the couple believe their children get along better with one another than they wouldaposve done had they been living in closer proximity with each other. We believe the kids get along better because they have space, they call us a family, they call each other step-siblings, that was totally on their terms, we didnapost push that language on them, Shelley said. We do all of our holidays and birthdays together and we do dinner a couple of nights a week altogether.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

However, the sister-in-law very recently got in touch to say they wouldnapost be coming as planned, as theyaposre currently trying to conceive, and didnapost want their good fortune rubbed in her face.My husband and his sister have a strained relationship and have since childhood. I have always got on very well with her but she has a competitive edge which is draining after a while, the mum, who has two children, aged one and four, wrote on Mumsnet. She always said we would have weddings children around the same time but it just didnapost work out that way. They have been trying for their first since June after their wedding in May. She continued: It was agreed ages ago that we would host my sister-in-law and her husband, my mother and father-in-law and my parents and siblings for Christmas, as the in-lawsapos house is only a mile from us and my family will stay over. My sister-in-law has messaged tonight and said she canapost see us over Christmas, as itaposs too hard whilst theyaposre trying to conceive and she canapost have our aposgood fortune rubbed in her face.apos Sheaposs also said she would prefer her parents also decline so they can spend it together. The mum went on to say that sheaposs completely sympathetic as to how hard it is to spend time with babies when youaposre so desperate to have some of your own, but explained that her having good fortune is not entirely the case.

In between my two children, I suffered an ectopic where I lost a tube, as well as two early losses and a -week loss. She knows this, she watched me go through the entire f***ing thing, she wrote.

I know I do have very good fortune to have two healthy children and Iaposm so grateful but f***, the youngest was hard won and I feel as though sheaposs poked the best a bit. One Mumsnet user responded: As someone who struggled please donapost take it personally. She is probably so far inside her own head over being upset and stressed that your struggle probably hasnapost even registered. I suspect from her point of view, she’d take your pain infor two healthy kids. Infertility is tough, please try to be gentle, another added. A third wrote: It’s not fucking infertility when she’s been trying a few months. I speak as someone who obsessively avoided babies and Christmas after trying for FIVE years.

One woman claims she was recently taking the bus home when she found herself in an awkward situation with an older woman who wanted to sit by herself as she didnapost feel safe. In a post on Reddit, the younger woman, who had just finished an eight hour day at work is currently  weeks pregnant, says she sat downstairs on the bus, as she had lots of heavy shopping bags and was nervous about falling on the stairs. She purposefully says she avoided sitting in the priority seats but instead was sat behind them when she was asked to move by a more senior lady with a walking stick. And the situation resulted in some drama on the bus. Her post on the Am I The A**hole forum read: AITA for not giving up my seat on the bus   Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. So Igot on the bus after an eight hour day in work. Now I get on at very first stop on the bus route and get off at the very last stop the whole journey takes about two hours.When I got on the bus it was quite busy on the bottom deck, with only one double seat left available. Usually, I would go upstairs when itaposs this busy but this time I had about - slightly heavy bags with me and didnapost feel safe trying to get up the stairs with them especially since Iaposm  weeks pregnant, so I sat on the seat downstairs. About halfway through the journey, an older lady with a stick got on the bus and she asked me to move. She wasnapost even polite when she asked and honestly I thought she meant move over so she could sit next to me. So I moved my bags and started to scoot over, when she aposNo, No I meant can you find another seat, this seat is reserved for disabled people. You are clearly not disabled. There are plenty of seats upstairsapos. These seats were not priority seats for disabled people the ones in front of me werebut these ones were not. so I replied, aposSorry, I really donapost feel safe going up the stairs with all these bags, I donapost mind you sitting next to me though, we both have our masks onapos.  She claims the other woman told her she didnapost want to sit next to anyone  as she didnapost feel safe. She then instructed the younger woman to move your lazy fat behind and give the seat to someone who needs it. The -year-old added: I hate confrontation and I absolutely hate people who use their pregnancy as an excuse, which means I hate what I said next. Lady I am pregnant, I am not going up those stairs with these bags and risking a fall. If you really want a seat to yourself ask someone  to move. A man sitting across from them then offered up his seat and went upstairs, but not before giving the pregnant woman a dirty look. She added: The lady spent the next - minutes talking with the other oldies on the bus about how the kids these days have no respect for their elders or people with disabilities, or how they would have never have spoken to someone like in their day. This happened a couple of days ago, while my boyfriend and my dad said I was in the right, but I canapost help but feel like I acted like an entitled brat. More than  people have since responded to the womanaposs post, with many agreeing that she was not in the wrong for standing her ground. One person said: NTA. You shouldaposve pointed out where the disabled seats were. Also, f**k older people who think their age entitles them to respect...theyaposre usually the ones lacking manners. Another wrote: All seats on the bus were double seats so she would have had to have sit next to someone, which she said she didnapost want to do. So basically she wanted a double seat to herself. A third commented: You are  weeks pregnant and you were making the right decision to keep you and baby safe. What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.

Hannah opened up about the experience on her TikTok @hannah.lham, in a video that has since been viewed almost ten million times.In the clip, she recalled remembering a weird memory of sticking a bead up her nose when she was a child but always thought that the bead had come out at some point. Until she developed a sinus infection and found the forgotten bead.She said: “You know those memories you have from being really little like three to five years old that you don’t knowthey’re real or there’s something you saw on a TV show or that your parents told you or something like that, so you’re not really surethey’re real but you remember them. When I was three I remember sticking a bead up my nose and being like ‘it’s not coming out.apos For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I didn’t tell anyone - I don’t know why - but I didn’t tell anyone that I stuck this bead up my nose and forgot about it. Until a few weeks ago when she developed a sinus infection. She said she felt like the right side of her nose was completely blocked from what she believed was from a massive booger.It would not come out, it was super painful and it was bothering me, she said.So she used an earwax camera to see what was going on up there, which was when she spotted the blue bead.  Hannah continued: Well, I finally got it out. It was very painful, but a bead—a blue bead that has been in my nose for  years—just came out of my nose.Twenty years Iaposve been living with a bead inside my nose, and I had no idea. Since being posted, the video has racked up more than . million likes and , comments. One person said: “You cannot throw that bead away. Use it as your something blue at your wedding. It’s an heirloom now.” Another asked: “Does breathing feel dferent without the bead now ” A third commented: “That bead has seen more of your le than you can remember.” Others shared stories of their own of random things theyaposd got stuck up their nose, like one person who said: Oh my god! I stuck a Polly Pocket shoe up my nose and couldnapost get it out, I think, and have not seen it since, another said. I thought, aposOh, I probably got it out.apos While someone  said: “OH MY GOD I DID THIS AS A KID AND NEVER TOLD ANYONE AND I HAVE HAD SO MUCH ANXIETY AND I ALWAYS THINK IT’S IN MY LUNGS AND I’M SO SCARED.” In a follow-up video, Hannah shared footage from the camera after viewers demanded to see evidence - but watch at your own risk.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Kalee McGee explained that when she adopted four-year-old Chihuahua Max from the shelter, he had no paperwork about his background. But because he was well behaved when she took him for walks, and he sits down when she gives him a treat, she assumed heaposd had some training. However, Kalee couldn’t work out why Max wasnapost listening to her. Until one day when she finally figured it out - he only understood Spanish.She shared the hilarious discovery on her TikTok account@kaleemcgee , where she said: “I’m gonna talk fast because your time is precious but this is hilarious and I have no one  to tell so please listen. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.“We adopted a dog two, three weeks ago, a great little chihuahua four years old from the shelter, no information on him, absolutely adorable, super great. “He sits when you have a treat in your hand not when you say sit, he knows what a crate is and he walks really well on a leash so it seems he has some training, but he won’t listen to us so. “We’re trying to get him to sit, trying to get him to do this stuff for weeks and we can’t figure out why he won’t listen to us…” Then they worked it out. He only speaks Spanish, she said. Our little chihuahua doesn’t know English and has been looking at us like what are you talking about. I died when I found out so I’ve got to show you. In the next clip, when she says Max come, he just stands there. But when she repeats the phrase in Spanish, he walks straight over to her wagging his tail. The same thing happens when she tells Max to sit. In English he ignores her, and in Spanish, he does exactly what she says.“I don’t speak Spanish so I know that wasn’t the best, we’ve been relying on Google Translate, but pleaseyou have anything  let me know cause I would love to see how smart this cute little man is. I just don’t speak his language.”Since being posted, the video has racked up more than . million likes and , comments from people who were impressed by Kalee’s dedication. One person said: “How did you find out he speaks Spanish LOL.” Another wrote: The fact that you learned good boy in Spanish,” with a sad emoji. A third said: The thought of a person learning a new language for their new pup has me tearing up rn.” Someone  shared a list of Spanish phrases she could try with Max. They said: “Quieto  stay, vamos  let’s go, comida  food, galleta  treat. These are not universal, but work for my chi.”Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Hippos Imani, aged , and -year-old Hermien have no symptoms apart from a runny nose, but the zoo said the pair had been put into quarantine as a precaution. To my knowledge, this is the first time in this species. Worldwide, this virus has been reported mainly in great apes and felines, said the zooaposs vet, Francis Vercammen.Pets including cats, dogs and ferrets have become infected following contact with their owners, while in zoos, cases have been reported in animals such as big cats, otters, primates and hyenas. The disease has also spread in mink farms and to wild animals, such as deer. Antwerp Zoo is investigating the causes of the contagion. None of the zookeepers had recently shown COVID- symptoms or tested positive for the virus, the zoo said.  Last month a pet dog became the first pooch to become infected with the virus in the UK. The pup apparently caught the virus from its owners. The infection was confirmed following tests at the Animal and Plant Health Agencylaboratory in Weybridge, Surrey, last week.It is believed the dog, which is recovering at home, contracted coronavirus from its owners, who had previously tested positive for the virus.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ZoosAnimalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The house in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, was a typical s property, painted in bright colours and had dated furnishings. So the thrty couple used clever DIY tricks and upcycling furniture to suit their tastes without splashing out on new items. Molly, a marketing manager, gave their downstairs shower utility room a makeover on a budget using some leftover Frenchic black paint and marble vinyl cover which cost £. She painted the chrome shower doors, then painted the utility cupboards and covered the work surface in the marble sticky roll. She also upcycled an old storage box using leftover paint from another project, giving the box a stunning makeover without spending a penny. Molly also turned a £ plain glass vase from IKEA into an on-trend neutral toned decorative pot using a sample pot of concrete-effect spray from BQ which cost £.. She estimates a similar stone vase would have cost £. She even tried her hand at arts and crafts, creating her own abstract art piece for the lounge, spending £ on paints and a canvas – as opposed to an estimated £ that a similar art piece could have set them back.The couple also did the ling in their bedroom and the dining room themselves, following Instagram video tutorials and spending £ on materials.The couple finished the interior renovations in just under four months, moving in on December , . “We’re really pleased with the results – we’ve created our dream home, which we can see us living in forever, Molly said today. We are completely finished now and it has completely transformed our home. The detached property is now worth £, - a staggering % increase on the price they bought it for in August last year. It has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, dining room, lounge, and conservatory. Molly added: We wanted to put our own stamp on it and create something we could call our own, so we decided to go for it and do a complete renovation. It soon turned into a building site.  Professionals carried out the larger jobs – including removing the wall, working on the conservatory and the electrics – but Molly and Sam took charge of the cosmetic work. Molly said: We had evenings and weekends where we could just crack on and get stuff finished – we would sometimes be here until  or pm at night finishing off bits. Me and Sam were useless going into this – Iaposd never even painted a room before and Sam hadnapost used a drill. You just kind of learn as you go.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

They have no control over pricing and stocking policy, which is decided by the board.#Stressing that the supermarket operates a UK pricing policy, a Co-op spokesperson said: #Co-op is committed to serving and supporting its rural communities, conveniently, including areas where other retailers often do not trade due to the increased operational costs.#Like all retailers, Co-op has experienced some patchy disruption to the availability of some products, and it is working with suppliers to re-stock as quickly as possible.#Alongside well-known brands, Co-op#s award-winning own-brand products provide shoppers with choice # delivering quality and value, while also enabling customers and community causes to unlock additional value and benefits through its membership programme.#Mr Bates added: #The Co-op bosses in Manchester need to realise that the Tarbert Co-op and others in rural locations are not convenience stores. These are often the only store for miles and are therefore leline stores.#If they do not understand this, then they do not understand the communities they are serving.#Speaking on Wednesday this week, Mr Bates said he had received no reply from Co-op management.He said ##apart from an automated receipt reply, I have heard nothing further.

It is rocked by waves and she clings on for le, the freezing water lapping over her.But thankfully, there is a happy ending to this story. Her small boat begins to drt inland, across the Firth of Forth, away from the kingdom of her abuser and towards the opposite shore, where she lands just in time. There, on the beach by Culross in Fe, she finds a fire with embers still giving warmth.Jocelinus tells us: ldquoThere were, in the neighbourhood, shepherds keeping watch over the flocks. And they beheld a fire lighted close at hand, and coming with haste found the young woman with her childbirth completed, and the child wrapped in rags, lying in the open air. They, moved by pity, took care of them by increasing the fire and supplying food, and procuring other necessarieshellipSt Serf took them in and cared for them, and Thenewrsquos child would become Saint Kentigern.This story is not provable history, of course, more likely itrsquos mostly legend making. Yet unknown truths often lie under the surface of legends and I for one have always seen the universal truths in this story.When I look into the faces of my children, I hope and pray they will never feel the fear and desperation that is on the face of Thenew of being cast at sea with the desperate hope of finding a safe place.And , God forbid, they ever do, I hope they will be met by people like those shepherds.Andever they, or I, were to meet someone in such a desperate situation, then I hope we would be like those shepherds and respond with kindness, understanding and compassion.That, for me, is the truth in this story it may be an ancient tale, but its relevance is undiminished by time."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-omicron-isolation-rules-new-covid-variant","story":"First discovered in South Africa, Omicron has prompted new restrictions on travelto be introduced around the UK.In England rules on mask wearing have been reimposed -Wales and Scotland have maintainedrules on face coverings throughout the pandemic.In order to try and curb the spread of the new iant, the self isolation rules in Scotland have changed.Heres everything you need to know...Anyone who tests positive forOmicron in Scotland must self isolate for  days.All close contacts of suspected Omicron infections must self isolate for -days, whether they are fully vaccinated or not.People will be told when they receive their PCR resultsthey have the Omicron iant.Anyone who tests positive for Covid- must self-isolate for -days.However, its a dferent story for close contacts.If you are fully vaccinated and a close contact of someone who tests positive for Covid, you must isolate until you get a PCR test.Ifyourresult then comes back negative and youremain asymptomatic, you will no longer have to isolate.Howeveryou are not vaccinated or only partially vaccinated and are identied as a close contact of someone with Covid,you must isolate for -days regardless of the result of your PCR test."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/12790903.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"sunday-times-schools-guide-2022---see-top-schools-scotland","story":"There are dferent lists for state and private schools, with institutions in ious areas making the cut.These schools are ranked by their pre-pandemic exam results in  and .Bishopbriggs Academy has beennamed Scottish Secondary School of the Decade, having risen through the ranks.The school only broke the top  in , and this year has been named number  on the state school list.Hereare the Sunday Times best Scottish schools for ....

I cant see the situation dramatically changing in the next couple of weeks - we have to watch this space...thats genuinely where we are scientically right now.\": Latest Omicron casein Scotland not connected to othersA total of  cases of the Omicron iant have been confirmed in Scotland so far,including at leastnine which are linked and have been traced back to a single private event held on November .It is unclear whether the three confirmedtoday- two in NHS Lanarkshire and one in the Greater Glasgow area- are linked to this event or separate.One caseidentied in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, confirmed on Wednesday, was not linked to that event.The Omicron iant was first detected in Botswana in November and appears to be driving a rapid surge in Covid infections in South Africa, with signs that it is overtaking Delta as the dominant strain.There are concerns that its high number of mutations - including  on the spike protein used by the virus to infect cells - could make it more resistant to current vaccines and immunity.There are signs from Public Health Scotland data that the recent fall in Covid cases stopped on November  with a very small increase in positive cases by November If protection against infection is reduced, however, scientists remain confident that vaccines would still provide a strong defence against serious illness or death - as has already been seen following the emergence of the Delta strain.Prof Bauld said: \"I think we should be worried about Omicron because it really, genuinely does look more transmissible.\"We dont know about disease severity or immune escape from the vaccines, but we have confidence that eventhe vaccines are weakened in terms of transmission and infection that they will still work in terms of saving peoples lives basically. Even these current vaccines that we have.\"So I am worried, but Im not saying that these vaccines are useless - theyre still working and will still work, evennot as well, against Omicron.\": Abnormal spike in neonatal deaths not linked to Covid in mothers orbabiesProf Bauld told podcast listeners that it was \"absolutely imminent\" that boosters will be added to Scotlands vaccine passport apps, allowing people travelling abroad to show that they have had a third jag.Some countries are now requesting proof of boosters for entry as part of border controls, or for access into leisure and hospitality venues.However, Prof Bauld said she was not in favour of tougher rules on arrivals into the UK.The Scottish Government has asked Westminster to consider extending home self-isolation to eight days for travellers arriving from non-red list countries, with people only able to end self-isolationthey test negative for Covid on a PCR test taken on day eight.Currently, all arrivals have to take a PCR test within two days of entering the UK and remain in isolation until they receive a negative result.Prof Bauld said this was \"proportionate\".She added: \"Im really hopeful that we dont go in that direction [eight-day self-isolation] unless we absolutely have to.\"The main reason for that is that when you see domestic spread of this iant, then thinking about travel as the main source becomes less of an issue.\"Its too early to tellthat would occur - governments arent ruling it out - but its not the plan at the moment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"review-nutcracker-festival-theatre-edinburgh","story":"The NutcrackerFestival Theatre, EdinburghMary Brennan*****Irsquom happy to report that No Rules have been broken at this Christmas party although occasionally, at some performances, there will be a twist on the usual guest list, with the magician Drosselmeyer portrayed by a female dancer.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building.

CuomoDecember , CNN was reviewing Chris Cuomorsquos conduct following the new information, and a law firm hired to help had recommended the network terminate his employment.ldquoIt goes without saying that these decisions are not easy, and there are a lot of complex factors involved, CNN chief Jeff Zucker wrote in an email to staff on Saturday.Chris Cuomo issued a statement on Twitter calling the decision disappointing.ldquoThis is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother. So let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did, he said.The new misconduct allegation comes after a veteran TV executive, Shelley Ross, wrote a column for The New York Times in September saying Chris Cuomo had groped her at a party  years ago, when they both worked for ABC News.Chris Cuomo told the newspaper that ldquoI apologised to her then, and I meant it.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This is helping to ensure a safer world for all people everywhere. #COVIDmdash Tedros Adhanom GhebreyesusDecember , Dr Fauci said the Biden administration is considering lting travel restrictions against non-citizens entering the United States from several African countries.They were imposed as the Omicron iant exploded in the region, but UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has blasted such measures as ldquotravel apartheid.ldquoHopefully wersquoll be able to lt that ban in a quite reasonable period of time, Dr Fauci said. ldquoWe all feel very badly about the hardship that has been put on not only on South Africa but the other African countries.Omicron had been detected in about a third of US states by Sunday, including in the Northeast, the South, the Great Plains and the West Coast. Wisconsin and Missouri were among the latest states to confirm cases.But Delta remains the dominant iant, making up more than % of cases and driving a surge of hospital admissions in the north.National Guard teams have been sent to help overwhelmed hospitals in western New York, and Massachusetts Gov Charlie Baker issued an emergency order requiring any hospitals facing limited patient capacity to reduce scheduled procedures that are not urgent.US officials continued urging people to get vaccinated and to receive booster shots, as well as take precautions such as wearing masks when among strangers indoors, saying anything that helps protect against delta will also help protect against other iants.EvenOmicron proves less dangerous than Delta, it remains problematic, World Health Organisation epidemiologist Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said.ldquoEvenwe have a large number of cases that are mild, some of those iniduals will need hospitalisations, she said.ldquoThey will need to go into ICU and some people will die. We donrsquot want to see that happen on top of an already dficult situation with Delta circulating globally.Two years into the outbreak, Covid- has killed more than , Americans, and deaths are running at about  per day.More than , new hospital admissions are being reported daily, according to tracking data from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.Covid- cases and deaths in the US have dropped by about half since the Delta peak in August and September, but at more than , new infections per day, the numbers are still high, especially heading into the holidays, when people travel and gather with family.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Last night was the first night.”“I went down on Monday and there was no mention of it. You used to get a  per cent discount.”He added: “I was totally surprised. I only booked my ticket a week or so ago. I wasn’t advised, and it doesn’t seem astheir crew was advised – I did query it with them.”Serco NorthLink’s commercial director Jim Dow said: “We are proud to offer an extensive food and drink menu on board that is very reasonably priced and equal for all passengers.“Our commitment to working with local suppliers continues and we are proud to showcase those partnerships. “While the Islander discount code is no longer in place, all passengers do have access to a iety of choices and price points.”A classic example of where profits are more important than the service Serco gives. Despite it being a leline service, Serco obviously see#s this as an oppertunity to profit from this by penalising islanders regardless.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4285900.jpg--.jpg?1638548013000\n","title":"ballymena soprano catrina launches classical celtic christmas album","story":"BALLYMENA Soprano, Catrina Scullion, is launching her new album, “Classical Celtic Christmas”, in St Marys Church, Haddington Road, Dublin, tonight at pm.For those who cannot attend, the event will be broadcast virtually from the church.To watch this event please visit https:www.stmaryshaddingtonroad.ie Popular songs will include O Holy Night and Silent Night.Catrinas CD will be available in the Repository at All Saints Church, Ballymena, for pound, with proceeds being donated to St Vincent DePaul.It is hoped the local community in Ballymena will tune in and support Catrina.The Ballymenachatted to Catrina this week.

Led by Linzi McGaughey and Clare Caulfield, the group reached far and wide across the borough to ask for materials and sewers who could turn the materials into scrubs.“Such was the scale of the operation, and the scale of the generosity of local people, that soon teams of people had to be drafted in to help source, sort and allocate materials to the sewers. Sewing machines were dusted off, and a real dference was made to our frontline healthcare system.“Local businesses and communities got behind the group with fundraising, and the demand for their scrubs just kept growing. Up to  hours a day was spent taking orders directly from the hospitals, doctors, nurses, community workers, and care homes. We are all indebted to this group of amazing people, and it was wonderful to be able to view their latest creation in quilt form as a testament to all of their hard work and dedication.”Health Minister Robin Swann added: “The pandemic will be etched in our memories as one of the most challenging, anxious and indeed sad periods in our history but for me it will also be a time when we saw humanity at its very best. Despite adversity, we witnessed teams of volunteers, like NI Scrubs, step forward and achieve so much.“You should all be very proud of the contribution you made and you have my sincere appreciation for your efforts. There is no doubt that Covid has been a hugely challenging time for everyone and this is particularly true for those working in our health and social care services. The tapestry is a very fitting tribute to all the staff who worked tirelessly and courageously for us throughout the pandemic.“I want to again place on record my thanks to every single one of our health and social care workers for everything they do, every day.”Accepting the tapestry on behalf of Northern Health and Social Care Trust, Chairman Bob McCann, said: “I would like to thank the NI Scrubs volunteers for this very poignant and reflective piece of art, which in years to come will be a very important reminder of how far we all came in the fight against COVID-.“The pandemic has clearly had a signicant and sustained impact on all aspects of our health service and our staff have faced many challenges over the course of the last  months. I know that staff were very appreciative of initiatives such as that of NI Scrubs and the generosity and kindness shown to staff buoyed them during some of the darkest days.”Clare Caulfield from NI Scrubs said the tapestry was “a wonderful legacy” to all those who played their part.She added: “At the time we asked all our volunteers to give us a piece of material with their initials on it. We asked them to send the pieces in but we didnt tell them what we were going to do with them. “We had them made into a large tapestry, a wonderful legacy to everyone involved.” Clare continued: “The huge effort of every volunteer will be talked about for generations. It is mine and Linzi’s honour to have played a small part in this incredible team of amazing iniduals who stepped up when our country needed kindness, support and community the most.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4283615.jpg--.jpg?1638527740000\n","title":"demand high for booster jabs says trust","story":"The Seven Towers Mass Vaccination Centre is open for booster jabs for those aged over  group as per Department of Health guidance.

You could probably multiply that apprehensiveness by a factor of  for Co Down couple David and Fiona Boyd-Armstrong when, seven years ago, they took a deep breath and sent Northern Ireland’s first artisan gin out into the shops.Shortcross hit the shelves in , blazing a trail for a new wave of small spirit distillers and adding a new dimension to what was then Northern Ireland’s fledgling food and drink renaissance. Today it’s a familiar and trusted brand with a loyal fan base. But don’t think any of that came easily.Shortly before they married in , David and Fiona went on a wine tour in France, made some valuable contacts, and mulled over the idea of their own drinks business as they planned a future together. “In an ideal world we’d have started our own vineyard,” admits David. “But hey, we live in Co Down.”So instead they turned to gin. At the time, craft gin just wasn’t on the radar at all here. No one  was making it and the vast majority of drinkers had a limited choice of Gordon’s or maybe Cork Dry or Gilbey’s. In these days of bars with eye-popping gin menus stretching to hundreds of brands, it’s hard to appreciate just how audacious the Boyd-Armstrongs’ decision was.David and Fiona spent every weekend and every holiday doing research and visiting distilleries across the globe from Seattle to Seoul. They found inspiration in the legion of micro-producers dotted across America and took heart from the buying policy of one of the bigger bars in Seattle, which stocked nothing but small-scale, locally-produced drinks.The couple ordered their first still in , installed it at Rademon — the Crossgar estate owned by Fiona’s family — and spent the summer and autumn of that year developing and fine-tuning their recipe. They wanted to do everything themselves. “There was no bottling plant available to us so we had to learn how to bottle,” says Fiona. “We had to become experts in every part of the process.”After the launch in , they found they still had another part of the process to learn. Producing a new gin was only half the battle — the other half was trying to convince gin drinkers to forego their Gordon’s or their Cork Dry and try Shortcross instead. “It was like climbing a mountain,” Fiona confesses.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Introducing anything new is always going to be challenging — for example, it took us three years to get Shortcross into airport shops,” she says. “Really it’s all about changing perceptions. We found that people get more interested in your gin when you break it down for them and explain the components and how they come together.”It took years of hard work and resolve to make Shortcross the success it is today. With a larger still, a team of around  people and an expanding range that includes a cask-aged gin and the highly successful Rosie’s Garden pink gin, it must have been tempting for the Boyd-Armstrongs just to keep on doing what they’re doing.But all the time, in the background, there was another project that fascinated them.Just a couple of years after the first gin was launched, David and Fiona began distilling whiskey. And just like in the gin process, they wanted to do everything themselves. David had grown up in east Belfast, in the shadow of buildings that once housed the famous old whiskey distilleries of Avoniel and Connswater, and long before they starting making whiskey themselves, Fiona had become fascinated by the story of Ulster’s lost distilleries, so perhaps the seed of an idea had been quietly germinating for many years before it finally became a reality.Once they had produced a raw spirit from malted barley on a small -litre still, they decided they wanted to do something dferent with it. Whiskey often begins its slow process of maturation in American oak barrels, sometimes ones that have previously held bourbon, and is then finished in something like old sherry casks. But the Boyd-Armstrongs opted to do things the other way round. In March  they obtained two Grand Cru Classe Bordeaux wine casks, filled them with their newly-made spirit and put them away to quietly mature.“The casks you use really have to match the spirit you distil,” says David. “There’s a degree of black magic in deciding what you want to use and theof time the whiskey spends in each one.”After the Bordeaux casks had weaved their black magic spell, the whiskey was finished in barrels made from virgin American oak. The Boyd-Armstrongs could have bottled and sold the whiskey after three years but instead let it sit for two more. “We found it just kept getting better and better,” says David. “Finishing it in the American oak casks brought a sweetness and a nuttiness to it.”The finished whiskey finally made it into slightly fewer than  bottles just last month and when David and Fiona spoke to me they were still waiting for the labels to arrive.“In commercial terms it’s one of the smallest batches of whiskey you’ll find anywhere,” says David. But he also proudly points out it’s the first new whiskey to be wholly produced by a Northern Ireland distillery outside of Old Bushmills since the s.Just like their gin, Shortcross whiskey is a product made entirely on site to unique specications and then launched into a market where there are big players galore.

Picture by Liam McBurneyCiaran O#NeillDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailTests are to be carried out to explore the viability of setting up a mining operation on one of Northern Ireland’s largest private estates.Recent exploration work has uncovered traces of a mineral called barite on land at Baronscourt Estate in Co Tyrone. As a result, several observation pits are to be dug on the land to find just how big the barite deposit is.If an “economic deposit of high-grade barite” is found, say the landowners, then a mine could be created.The majority of the barite mined throughout the world is used by the petroleum industry as a weighting material in the formulation of drilling mud.However, the mineral is also used in a wide iety of other applications, including cement, plastics, clutch pads, televisions and computer monitors, traffic cones, paint and golf balls.Baronscourt Estate, which is located near the village of Newtownstewart, has been home to the Duke of Abercorn’s family since .The Duke of Abercorn peerage was conferred on the Hamilton family by King James I, who was King of England and Ireland from  to .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The current Duke of Abercorn, and the fth person to hold the title, is James Hamilton, a former Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.Along with Baronscourt Estate, the Hamilton family also own land in Scotland. In  the Mount Castle Trust was set up to manage the family’s interests in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Baronscourt Estate is made up of approximately , acres, a large section of which is comprised of woodland.The site has around , acres of farmland as well as three lakes and a -acre golf course. There are also two disused quarries on the land.The Mount Castle Trust declined to comment on its mineral exploration plans for the Baronscourt Estate when contacted by the Sunday Independent.However, details of the proposal to explore the possibility of barite mining on the estate are contained in documentation sent by the trust to Derry City and Strabane District Council.In the documentation, the trust states a Mineral Prospecting Licence was granted for Baronscourt Estate in  by the Department for the Economy. This allowed the owners to explore for specied minerals within the area covered by the licence.The trust said initial sampling at a number of locations on the site in October last year ed “positive results” for traces of barite.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBaronscourt Estate in Co Tyrone FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBaronscourt Estate in Co TyroneThe next phase of the exploration project at Baronscourt Estate will involve the digging of  observation pits on the land.An excavator will be used to dig the pits to a depth of between two and three metres. Geologists will then extract samples of the rock for analysis.The Mount Castle Trust said once the rock vein has been photographed, measured and samples collected, the pit will be filled in and the ground surface reinstated to its original condition.Digging is to take place in five separate locations on the estate. The mineral exploration project is expected to be completed within a four-month period. In the documents presented to the local council, the trust statesa barite mine is created the only visible evidence would be a “small portal entrance” to an underground mine.The trust said mining of barite has a “low environmental impact” as there are no heavy metals or toxic minerals involved in the process.“Barite mining at Baronscourt would have absolute minimum adverse environmental effects,” the documents state.Barite is currently mined in around  countries worldwide, with China being the biggest producer.There were previously a signicant number of barite mines in Ireland, but none of them are still in operation.One of these was within Benbulben mountain in Co Sligo. The mine started in  and remained in production for around  years.There were also barite mines in Cork and Galway. In Northern Ireland, small deposits of the mineral have been mined in parts of Derry, Antrim, Armagh and Tyrone.The Baronscourt Estate is located in the foothills of the Sperrin Mountains.Canadian company Dalradian Gold has applied for planning permission to develop a gold mine in the mountains.However, there is strong opposition within the local community to the plans for the gold mine and Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has asked the Planning Appeals Commission to set up a public inquiry into the Dalradian application. Most ReadTributes paid to schoolgirlwho died suddenlyBankrupt star Mark Allen snookered by £k tax billSmirking paedophile priest turns his grubby hands to perverted literatureFAI only ever interested in nationalist players, says ex-NI boss O’NeillInside Belfast’s Airbnb sex dungeonTop VideosPlayVideo: Man dies in Larne RTCPlayVaccine passport protest takes place in BelfastPlayVideo: CCTV Footage shows man engulfed in getaway car fireball after Dublin shootingLatest Northern IrelandBoxing club helping to transform notorious north Belfast interfaceInternational travellers to NI will have to undergo pre-departure Covid testDepartment of Health set out latest Covid travel rules: Pre-departure tests will be needed for those coming into NIWatch: Jamie Dornan stars in first trailer for BBC thriller The TouristDerry girl Nadine Coyle still hoping for special cameo in Channel  comedy showLatestMan arrested on suspicion of making or possessing explosive substance in DerbyChris Cuomo accused of harassment days before CNN firingIn Pictures: Stars on the red carpet at the  British Independent Film AwardsBoxing club helping to transform notorious north Belfast interfaceWe can still be better, warns Steven Gerrard after third win in four,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is helping to ensure a safer world for all people everywhere. #COVID— Tedros Adhanom GhebreyesusDecember , Dr Fauci said the Biden administration is considering lting travel restrictions against non-citizens entering the United States from several African countries.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up They were imposed as the Omicron iant exploded in the region, but UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has blasted such measures as “travel apartheid.”“Hopefully we’ll be able to lt that ban in a quite reasonable period of time,” Dr Fauci said. “We all feel very badly about the hardship that has been put on not only on South Africa but the other African countries.”Omicron had been detected in about a third of US states by Sunday, including in the Northeast, the South, the Great Plains and the West Coast. Wisconsin and Missouri were among the latest states to confirm cases.But Delta remains the dominant iant, making up more than % of cases and driving a surge of hospital admissions in the north.National Guard teams have been sent to help overwhelmed hospitals in western New York, and Massachusetts Gov Charlie Baker issued an emergency order requiring any hospitals facing limited patient capacity to reduce scheduled procedures that are not urgent.US officials continued urging people to get vaccinated and to receive booster shots, as well as take precautions such as wearing masks when among strangers indoors, saying anything that helps protect against delta will also help protect against other iants.EvenOmicron proves less dangerous than Delta, it remains problematic, World Health Organisation epidemiologist Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said.“Evenwe have a large number of cases that are mild, some of those iniduals will need hospitalisations,” she said.“They will need to go into ICU and some people will die. We don’t want to see that happen on top of an already dficult situation with Delta circulating globally.”Two years into the outbreak, Covid- has killed more than , Americans, and deaths are running at about  per day.More than , new hospital admissions are being reported daily, according to tracking data from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.Covid- cases and deaths in the US have dropped by about half since the Delta peak in August and September, but at more than , new infections per day, the numbers are still high, especially heading into the holidays, when people travel and gather with family.Most ReadBankrupt star Mark Allen snookered by £k tax billTributes paid to schoolgirlwho died suddenlySmirking paedophile priest turns his grubby hands to perverted literatureFAI only ever interested in nationalist players, says ex-NI boss O’NeillInside Belfast’s Airbnb sex dungeonTop VideosPlayVideo: Man dies in Larne RTCPlayVaccine passport protest takes place in BelfastPlayVideo: CCTV Footage shows man engulfed in getaway car fireball after Dublin shootingLatest WorldChris Cuomo accused of harassment days before CNN firingWomen activists call for greater rights in AfghanistanViolence as French far-right TV pundit holds campaign rallySenate leader and presidential candidate Bob Dole dies aged Belgian police use water cannon and tear gas on Covid protestersLatestDirector of football Marcel Brands reportedly set to leave EvertonMan arrested on suspicion of making or possessing explosive substance in DerbyChris Cuomo accused of harassment days before CNN firingIn Pictures: Stars on the red carpet at the  British Independent Film AwardsBoxing club helping to transform notorious north Belfast interface,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” .

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

A Christmas adventure set in Derry is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Once upon a time, what started as a bedtime story could become a Christmas best-seller. googletag.cmd.push Derry-based writer, Robert Campbell, has released a new childrens novel, “Sled Down!” where four animal schoolchildren from Culmore venture into the city to save Christmas. The characters, Ralph , Susan , Finbarand Bettyget wind of Santas elves crashing the sled on a test run over the River Foyle and the reindeer have escaped. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Reynolds had a previous spell at the club back in - under Stephen Kenny and he admitted he felt he had unfinished business at the Brandywell. “I’m not sureI ever thought I would arrive back here but it is a club I have a good affinity with,” he said. “I really enjoyed my spell here in  and . At times I felt like it was unfinished business that I would end up here at some stage because of the relationship I had with some of the people up here. I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new challenge and there’s a lot expected from us, but we’ll embrace that and enjoy it.” City boss Ruaidhri Higgins took his time deciding on his number two and feels he has now got the right man for the job. “Alan is a fantastic coach and it is important for me to have someone of his quality and experience here,” he stated. “He knows the league inside out and will have the trust of the players, which is key.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Seanie McIntosh’s attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

Hugh McGrath’s team produced an emphatic second half performance to stun their Monaghan opponents just when it seemed that they were in trouble after a dficult first period. The first half started extremely well for Brian Ogs who replied to Davy Garland’s point by putting the ball in the net with their first attack, Eoghan Bradley hammering in from close range after good work by Gareth Logue. But Donaghmoyne responded strongly with two goals of their own in the space of seven minutes. Ronan McDonald got the better of Kevin Lindsay before firing through Eoghan Heraghty’s legs, and Liam McDonald then fired home from the penalty spot after Eoghan Concannon had fouled Davy Garland. Steelstown were too reckless with their shooting, five unforced wides, and they went  minutes without scoring as Donaghamoyne took control – McDonald and Garland scoring to put four points between them as half time approached. McCarron’s score on  minutes took it down to -, - with Steelstown needing a signicant improvement in the second half. The game was turned on its head completely as two goals in the first seven minutes contributed to a seven-point swing in the scoreline. Both goals came from Cahir McMonagle, scoring just seconds after throw-in before finding the net a second time after picking up a loose shot from Ben McCarron. Further scores from Oran McManamin, Oran Fox and McMonagle sent Steelstown -,  clear before Garland hit back after an -minute drought for Donaghmoyne. Steelstown’s lead increased when Niall Meegan hauled down Diarmuid Baker, and Ben McCarron slotted in from the penalty spot. Morgan Murray came off the bench to score two points and Donncha Gilmore had the last say as Steelstown cruised to victory.

Hugh McGrath’s team produced an emphatic second half performance to stun their Monaghan opponents just when it seemed that they were in trouble after a dficult first period. The first half started extremely well for Brian Ogs who replied to Davy Garland’s point by putting the ball in the net with their first attack, Eoghan Bradley hammering in from close range after good work by Gareth Logue. But Donaghmoyne responded strongly with two goals of their own in the space of seven minutes. Ronan McDonald got the better of Kevin Lindsay before firing through Eoghan Heraghty’s legs, and Liam McDonald then fired home from the penalty spot after Eoghan Concannon had fouled Davy Garland. Steelstown were too reckless with their shooting, five unforced wides, and they went  minutes without scoring as Donaghamoyne took control – McDonald and Garland scoring to put four points between them as half time approached. McCarron’s score on  minutes took it down to -, - with Steelstown needing a signicant improvement in the second half. The game was turned on its head completely as two goals in the first seven minutes contributed to a seven-point swing in the scoreline. Both goals came from Cahir McMonagle, scoring just seconds after throw-in before finding the net a second time after picking up a loose shot from Ben McCarron. Further scores from Oran McManamin, Oran Fox and McMonagle sent Steelstown -,  clear before Garland hit back after an -minute drought for Donaghmoyne. Steelstown’s lead increased when Niall Meegan hauled down Diarmuid Baker, and Ben McCarron slotted in from the penalty spot. Morgan Murray came off the bench to score two points and Donncha Gilmore had the last say as Steelstown cruised to victory.

Gemma Doherty and Morgana MacIntyre, Reporter: Domhnall MacDermott Dec   addthis, Fresh from winning Album of the Year at the NI Music Awards, the Derry Belfast duo Saint Sister are destined for big things. The group, made up of Derry born singer harpist Gemma Doherty, of the Delacroix Dohertys, and Belfast-born singer Morgana MacIntyre, are currently playing their first tour in almost two years. googletag.cmd.push I caught up with Gemma after their triumphant Nerve Centre debut last weekend: What’s it like playing for crowds again after a year of livestreams  “It was amazing to see creative people come together and make some really special online shows in the absence of live music. “That said, it’s hard to beat the feeling of people coming together and experiencing something live in a room. “I really missed the feedback you get from the audience and how that feeds into the performance. “It can completely dictate the energy of a show, and that’s just not something you can create with only cameras in the room. “I think we’ve been a lot less nervous chatting and engaging with the audience since everything has opened back up, and we’re a lot more aware of being in the moment since it was taken away from us for a while.” Which do you prefer  Stripped down shows or playing with the full band  “I absolutely love playing the shows with the full band, especially with the seven-piece or the -piece band that we got to play with for our album livestream back in June. It’s a dream to hear the full scale of the album arrangements behind us when we’re on stage. “But I’ve been really enjoying the run of more intimate two-piece shows that we’ve been playing over the last few weeks. “When you strip the songs right back to their core, it becomes all about the vocals and finding the journey of each song with just one instrument behind it. “ We seem to lock into a dferent kind of flow and it feels like we’re engaging with the audience on a dferent level.” What was it like opening for Keane in America before lockdown  “It was great craic. Those were some of the biggest venues we’d ever played and the crowds and venues were beautul. “The last show we played in the states was in the stunning Dolby Theatre in LA where the Oscars had been held just a few weeks before. “It was supposed to be a  date tour, but we got to play  shows on the West Coast before things started closing down and we had to come home.” What’s been the best part of touring again and why was it playing Derry  “Hearing people sing along to the tunes from the second album has been really special, and as I mentioned before, being able to feel the audience in the room again and react to their energy. Derry was a class gig, we loved it. “It’s always a bit nerve-racking playing in your hometown, the stakes feel higher. “But it was the warmest welcome we could have asked for, and the same in Morgan’s hometown Belfast the following night.” Did you make any changes to the new album after lockdown delayed it’s release  “Thankfully we had just got our final mixes back around the beginning of March , and by the time the first lockdown hit we were already getting it mastered. It would have been so tempting to go back in and tweak it endlessly with the perceived extra time that lockdown gave us. I’m grateful in a way that it was finished before all that, and that it got to stay true to itself before the world went a bit mad.” How did it feel to win the NI Music Award’s Album of the Year   “Thank you! There were so many great albums out this year so we were genuinely shocked when it was announced. We missed the ceremony in the Ulster Hall unfortunately as we had a show in Waterford that night but we came off stage and looked at our phones and got a lovely surprise! And we got to celebrate properly a few nights later with the hometown shows in Derry and Belfast.” Other Voices is  this year. Want to share some memories of it from over the years  “Some of our favourite experiences as a band have been with the Other Voices gang. “There Courage livestreams were so inspiring and really set the bar for what a streamed experience could be, taking hold of some of the country’s most beautul spaces and opening them up in a new way. “We did an Other Voices livestream in the Guildhall last July with the string quartet from the Crash Ensemble and I think it was one of my favourite shows of all time. “ We’ve had some of the best weekends in Dingle over the years too, playing in St James’ Church in  was a massive one. “We met Lisa Hannigan for the first time outside the church after that gig, which lead to us going on tour with her a few months later, and having her feature on our most recent album.” Saint Sister’s brilliant second album, ‘Where I Should End,’ is available in Cool Discs on Foyle Street and other good record shops.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Spring: Sunday, The Horror Channel @ pm A disastrous personal le has Evan in a tizzy so he does a legger from the United States to Italy and its here he meets an unusual woman called Louise and a dalliance with her makes his existence back in America look rather normal. A film you want to watch knowing as little about it as possible. Its fun, atmospheric and it will lurk in your head for a while. The fact that its on the horror channel will clue you in. Lou Taylor Pucci andNadia Hilker work well together. Last Orders: Sunday, Film @ pm Jack has passed away and his friends are in mourning. He went out with a smile and one final wish - that his friends get together once more to reminisce and scatter his ashes over the beach he loved so well. An elegant, touching and humane look at the pleasures and hardships of lelong friendships told wonderfully by director Fred Schepisi and a stunner of a cast that includes Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, Ray Winston, Bob Hoskins and Tom Courtenay. Brighton Rock: Monday, Talking PicturesTV@ pm Pinkys the leader of a gang in pre-war Brighton. Hes a nasty piece of work and a run-in with a journalist causes big problems for him and for a naive young waitress named Rose whos witness to what he has done. This  adaption of Graham Greens celebrated novel is still a tense, nerve wracking and affecting watch  years later. A baby faced Richard Attenborough does memorable work in the lead role. Topsy Turvy: Monday, Film @ .pm Gilbert and Sullivan. A partnership for the ages. The men behind so many famous operas of the th century. Their work didnt always come easy to them though and Topsy Turvy gives us a peek behind their stage curtains. Mike Leighs  musical drama might be almost  hours long but its very entertaining and satisfying and in the company of actors like Timothy Spall, Jim Broadbent, Lesley Manville and Shirley Henderson the time flies Farming: Tuesday, Channel  @ .am A young Nigerian boy is sent by his family to England in the s to be raised in a white household. It was a practice known as farming, an attempt to give poor African children a better chance at le. It left some of them with a very confused look at their own racial identity. Based on directorAdewale Akinnuoye-Agbajes own le, its a raw and disturbing coming of age story and a damning indictment of the British governments warped policies. Damson Idris is an excellent lead. Tully: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Marlos struggling. Three kids are taking their toll on her and her marriage. A nanny is hired. An unusual nanny named Tully. A strange bond forms between the two women. Tully comes from the pen of Diablo Cody so its no surprise that it delves into myriad aspects of womanhood rarely seen on screen and that paired with fine turns from Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis makes it really worth a watch Catch And Release: Wednesday, Great! Movies @ .am On the day she was supposed to get married Gray finds herself at the funeral of the man she loved. She has no money and nowhere to live and has to move in with his room mates and soon finds out she didnt know him as well as she thought. This  romcom is enjoyableyou can zone out Kevin Smith as one of the room mates. Jenner Garner and Timothy Olyphant do good enough work together to help you ignore the eejit in the corner. Free State Of Jones: Wednesday, BBC two @ .pm Alienated by the confederation, a soldier deserts his post during the American civil war and together with farmers and freed slaves creates a new state. Things do not go smoothly. Gary Rosss  film is a vivid recreation of an era of American history that rarely gets mentioned. Its as brutal and ugly as youd expect but superb acting from Matthew McConnaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw  Mahershala Ali eases the pain. Another Year: Thursday, Channel  @ am Gerri and Tom are living a quiet, contented le and looking forward to the freedom that comes with retirement but their orced and unhappy friend Mary is becoming an increasingly large presence in their lives. The second Mike Leigh film of the week is too no big surprise another cracker, a deep e into the minutiae of everyday lives and loves that doesnt need fake drama to make its point. Ruth Sheen, Jim Broadbent and Lesley Manville are all impeccable. The Manchurian Candidate: Thursday, BBC @ pm Prisoners of warfrom capture in the Korean War to America. But all is not well. To say anymore might spoil a magnicent piece of neo-noir. A truly suspenseful film, intelligent, inventive, paranoid, complex and deeply layered. Fabulous acting abounds. Frank Sinatra gives one of his best performances but the star of the show is Angela Lansbury. Her character is quite the creation, you wont be able to look away from her. Lawman: Friday, TG @ .pm A marshal arrives into a town to arrest the troublemakers who caused the death of an old man in his town. The townsfolk arent going to make things easy for him though.

Burt Lancaster, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Ryan and Robert Duvall, all old hands at this genre, are all in fine form here. Wild Nights With Emily: Friday, Film @ .pm Not much is known about the personal le of Emily Dickinson, the th century American poet. She was long considered an eccentric loner by her neighbours inMassachusetts but Madeleine Olneks  romcom tells us a dferent version of her story.

The Leisure Seeker: Friday RTEacute One @ .pm The Leisure Seeker is the name of Ella and Johns RV and it becomes their home when they decide to drive from Boston to Key West in an attempt to revisit older, better times. A poignant watch that doesnt skimp on the realities of growing old while at the same time shows us a type of love and understanding that only exists after decades of being together. Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland work very well together as the leads.

Spring: Sunday, The Horror Channel @ pm A disastrous personal le has Evan in a tizzy so he does a legger from the United States to Italy and its here he meets an unusual woman called Louise and a dalliance with her makes his existence back in America look rather normal. A film you want to watch knowing as little about it as possible. Its fun, atmospheric and it will lurk in your head for a while. The fact that its on the horror channel will clue you in. Lou Taylor Pucci andNadia Hilker work well together. Last Orders: Sunday, Film @ pm Jack has passed away and his friends are in mourning. He went out with a smile and one final wish - that his friends get together once more to reminisce and scatter his ashes over the beach he loved so well. An elegant, touching and humane look at the pleasures and hardships of lelong friendships told wonderfully by director Fred Schepisi and a stunner of a cast that includes Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, Ray Winston, Bob Hoskins and Tom Courtenay. Brighton Rock: Monday, Talking PicturesTV@ pm Pinkys the leader of a gang in pre-war Brighton. Hes a nasty piece of work and a run-in with a journalist causes big problems for him and for a naive young waitress named Rose whos witness to what he has done. This  adaption of Graham Greens celebrated novel is still a tense, nerve wracking and affecting watch  years later. A baby faced Richard Attenborough does memorable work in the lead role. Topsy Turvy: Monday, Film @ .pm Gilbert and Sullivan. A partnership for the ages. The men behind so many famous operas of the th century. Their work didnt always come easy to them though and Topsy Turvy gives us a peek behind their stage curtains. Mike Leighs  musical drama might be almost  hours long but its very entertaining and satisfying and in the company of actors like Timothy Spall, Jim Broadbent, Lesley Manville and Shirley Henderson the time flies Farming: Tuesday, Channel  @ .am A young Nigerian boy is sent by his family to England in the s to be raised in a white household. It was a practice known as farming, an attempt to give poor African children a better chance at le. It left some of them with a very confused look at their own racial identity. Based on directorAdewale Akinnuoye-Agbajes own le, its a raw and disturbing coming of age story and a damning indictment of the British governments warped policies. Damson Idris is an excellent lead. Tully: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Marlos struggling. Three kids are taking their toll on her and her marriage. A nanny is hired. An unusual nanny named Tully. A strange bond forms between the two women. Tully comes from the pen of Diablo Cody so its no surprise that it delves into myriad aspects of womanhood rarely seen on screen and that paired with fine turns from Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis makes it really worth a watch Catch And Release: Wednesday, Great! Movies @ .am On the day she was supposed to get married Gray finds herself at the funeral of the man she loved. She has no money and nowhere to live and has to move in with his room mates and soon finds out she didnt know him as well as she thought. This  romcom is enjoyableyou can zone out Kevin Smith as one of the room mates. Jenner Garner and Timothy Olyphant do good enough work together to help you ignore the eejit in the corner. Free State Of Jones: Wednesday, BBC two @ .pm Alienated by the confederation, a soldier deserts his post during the American civil war and together with farmers and freed slaves creates a new state. Things do not go smoothly. Gary Rosss  film is a vivid recreation of an era of American history that rarely gets mentioned. Its as brutal and ugly as youd expect but superb acting from Matthew McConnaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw  Mahershala Ali eases the pain. Another Year: Thursday, Channel  @ am Gerri and Tom are living a quiet, contented le and looking forward to the freedom that comes with retirement but their orced and unhappy friend Mary is becoming an increasingly large presence in their lives. The second Mike Leigh film of the week is too no big surprise another cracker, a deep e into the minutiae of everyday lives and loves that doesnt need fake drama to make its point. Ruth Sheen, Jim Broadbent and Lesley Manville are all impeccable. The Manchurian Candidate: Thursday, BBC @ pm Prisoners of warfrom capture in the Korean War to America. But all is not well. To say anymore might spoil a magnicent piece of neo-noir. A truly suspenseful film, intelligent, inventive, paranoid, complex and deeply layered. Fabulous acting abounds. Frank Sinatra gives one of his best performances but the star of the show is Angela Lansbury. Her character is quite the creation, you wont be able to look away from her. Lawman: Friday, TG @ .pm A marshal arrives into a town to arrest the troublemakers who caused the death of an old man in his town. The townsfolk arent going to make things easy for him though. A hoary old revenge story is the basis of this blistering western and its one that effortlessly bridges the gap between the old fashioned westerns of the s and the dark and violent ones of the s. Burt Lancaster, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Ryan and Robert Duvall, all old hands at this genre, are all in fine form here. Wild Nights With Emily: Friday, Film @ .pm Not much is known about the personal le of Emily Dickinson, the th century American poet. She was long considered an eccentric loner by her neighbours inMassachusetts but Madeleine Olneks  romcom tells us a dferent version of her story. A surprisingly touching and warm look at how secrets are kept and how legends are created powered by strong turns from Molly Shannon, Amy Seimetz and Susan Zeigler. The Leisure Seeker: Friday RTEacute One @ .pm The Leisure Seeker is the name of Ella and Johns RV and it becomes their home when they decide to drive from Boston to Key West in an attempt to revisit older, better times. A poignant watch that doesnt skimp on the realities of growing old while at the same time shows us a type of love and understanding that only exists after decades of being together.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13269954.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Top left is the M towards Antrim, top right M bridge to Bangor, and bottom is WestlinkIt was written by the roads expert Wesley Johnston . The online version of this article links to it, see below.Wesley is an astute analyst of roads infrastructure, and he runs a website devoted to Northern Ireland’s highways - both those that have been built in recent years, those that are being built, and those that are planned.My heart sank when I read Wesley’s analsysis of the proposals to join three of NI’s busiest routes - the M, the Westlink M, and the M bridge - in a seamless interchange that will remove all traffic lights and all obstacles.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.He concluded that the scheme was now unlikely to proceed in its current form.I have had concerns about this vital project for many years, given the delays and reviews.Only last month a Belfast City Council committee voted to withdraw its support from the plans.Stormont’s infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon of the SDLP, has seemed, as Wesley put it, “lukewarm about York Street Interchange from the outset”.One of her predecessors, Sinn Fein’s Chris Hazzard, wanted to emphasise projects west of the Bann, such as the A.It seems that some politicians in the Alliance Party have turned against the York Street plan too.There are a number of reasons for the new coolness towards the interchange, including the growing interest in environmental matters and the changes to lestyle and travel patterns caused by Cocid.I wonderin some quarters there is an extra layer of hostility to the £ million project because the DUP secured funding for it as part of its agreement to sustain the Conservative Party in power in . This would be a disappointing outlookso, because the DUP was rightly praised for seeking financial support that would benefit the whole community, rather than just unionists, when it struck a deal with Theresa May after the general election of that year.There are some dubious ideas that are emerging now about road projects.The first is that it is automatically a good thing to constrain vehicle traffic in order to make way for cyclists and pedestrians and buses.It is indeed a good idea to do that in many contexts, particularly in urban areas. But often such changes help people who are young and able bodied and who live in densely populated areas.They do not help, say, a single mother in the suburbs who has to take her children to school in one direction in the rain, then travel in the other to a job in which it is not possible to work from home.It does not help an elderly person who lives in a rural area who depends on a car for their mobility and whose home is located in such a sparsely populated location that there is no prospect, ever of regular public transport services.In other words, it is not necessarily a selfish thing to want to run a car, as some of the more hardcore environmental scolds imply.In fact cars are one of the greatest advances in human history and have enabled people around the world to live much more liberated lives than they did only decades ago, when poorer people were unable to afford to travel far from their home.Covid has caused changes in lestyle pattern changes that should be welcomed, such as the increased flexibility caused by many people working from home. This will reduce rush hour congestion and will enable people to live far further from their work places and so should lead to a more even spread in property prices between town and country.Yet we have also seen that the desire that people have to use their car has — inevitably — come roaring back. Therefore we need to focus on making cars more environmentally efficient, and to make roads better too.The first part of that equation was happening anyway. When I was born in the US in the s, cars were grossly inefficient because petrol was so cheap. Now cars get two or three times more miles to the gallon than they did. Electric cars and other innovations will make this even better.But good, freeflowing trunk roads are an environmental boost too.In fact they can go in tandem with restrictions to traffic in towns and cities.I think we need more mph limits in urban areas, perhaps enforced by speed cameras, but more so-called expresswayswith mph limits to get between towns.The York St junction is a key example of this. We do not want traffic that is going from Stormont to West Belfast to crawl through city streets. We want it to travel on a ring road so that we can make those city streets more friendly to local and slower traffic.Not only should York St be built, we should be planing a free flowing junction at Tillysburn too and indeed a freer flowing outer ring road, ideally all the way round past Forestside and out towards the M near Lisburn, where traffic can then rejoin the ‘ring road’ back towards Belfast and the Westlink.Ms Mallon’s review of York Street which was completed this year recommended that the project think more broadly about its impacts on the local area. But the immediate vicinity of the road has been a noisy, congested junction for decades and will never cease to be so. The interchange would have made it easier to cross from the city centre to north Belfast by foot or bicycle by separating such traffic from the junction.As to the A, it too should be built, because such roads are far safer than single carriageways.

Because such was the outrage at seeing their hometown turned into a national laughing-stock over the ELO ban that droves of voters went to the polls and punished the DUP at the ballot box in local government elections.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

As well as endorsing previous Official Unionist Party policies since the foundation of the Northern Ireland state of locking up swings and closing down playgrounds on Sundays the DUP earned an even harder line reputation for trying to shut down anything it regarded as unchristian or anti-Biblical.In the s party stalwarts picketed cinemas showing Monty Python’s ‘Le of Brian’ or ‘The Exorcist’ and even protested over the first sex shops that opened in Northern Ireland during the early s. At one memorable and unintentionally hilarious demonstration outside a sex shop in East Belfast DUP activists held up placards calling on motorists to “bump your horn for decency.” As late as  the DUP used its influence on Newtonabbey Borough Council to have a play, ‘The Bible: The Complete Word of God ’ pulled from the schedule of ‘The Theatre at The Mill’. Evangelicals claimed it supposedly mocked the Bible.It is therefore a sign of how the Covid- pandemic has turned our world upside down that at present it is the DUP who is the party of fun and the defender of decadent delights while the rest of the political forces in the power sharing executive appear more like the modern day Puritans. He may not thank for me saying this but objectively the DUP Economy Minister Gordon Lyons is currently the publican’s best friend at Stormont.After Health Minister Robin Swann suggested last month that another lockdown might be necessary to curb the next mass outbreak of Covid infections in Northern Ireland Lyons came out firmly against any new socio-economic shutdown.The Economy Minister warned that the prospect of a Christmas lockdown would have a “horrendous impact” on businesses particularly in the hospitality sector. In an interview for ‘Ulster Business’ recently Lyons said a Christmas ‘circuit breaker’ “would really be a backward step” for the economy. How pub, café and restaurant owners must have cheered when they read those words!The minister’s defence of this vital, enterprising and tax revenue-raising sector of the economy should not be conflated with the anti-vax, social-distance sceptics out there who inhabit a weird, paranoid closed universe of conspiracy theories and unscientic irrationality. Protecting businesses and jobs should go hand in hand with protecting people’s health the two are not mutually exclusive.It is none the less a pity that some of his party colleagues most notably Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley seem to be sending out mixed messages about public health such as the necessity to wear face masks and the vaccination of  to -year olds.Gordon Lyons is right to stand up for the hard-hit bar owners and restaurateurs whose businesses were devastated during the albeit very necessary -month shut down. Yet these enterprises were only able to re-open againthanks largely to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme. It is justied that the minister champions the local hospitality industry in their opposition to yet another damaging and costly lockdown especially one which will probably not get any ‘cushion’ financing from the UK Treasury this time around.At the bar in my ‘local’ the proprietor John Bittles has left an unambiguous Christmas message for regulars and first-time visitors alike. Underneath the words, “Seasons Greetings” punters are advised: “No Jab, No Juice.” It is an exhortation that most of Bittles’ bar’s regular clients will adhere to once it becomes compulsory to produce proof of vaccination when we enter the pub.There is however a glaring contradiction in the policy of ‘No Jab, No Juice’ brought in by the Northern Ireland Executive for this festive month. After December th a customer can walk into any city centre bar for a lunchtime drink butthey have refused to be vaccinated then they will be shown the door. Several hours later that same person can walk up the Grosvenor or Lisburn Roads to go and work in the Royal or Belfast City Hospitals in whatever capacity and they will not have to produce proof of vaccination for Covid-.At the time of writing Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK where there are no mandatory vaccinations within the care home sector and the NHS. It is this policy rather than any silly posturing gestures over the ‘right’ not to wear a face mask that the DUP and its MPs should be questioning over the next few weeks and months.• Other comment pieces below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Henry McDonald Nov : Brexit might be why Bertie Ahern has joined the unionist bashing• Ben Lowry Dec : It is a great pity to see York St road plan in Belfast slipping away• Canon Ian Ellis Dec : Church leaders call for an end to the violence in Colombia• Dr Paul Kingsley Dec : Magee has courses not on offer where yet Protestants are under-represented• Robbie Butler Dec : Any amnesty will overwhelmingly benefit ex terrorists• Ruth Dudley Edwards Nov : It is superficial to blame religion for the NI Troubles• Owen Polley Nov : Windsor Park  NI-Republic football match was case study in nationalist myth making• David Trimble Nov : I feel betrayed by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which rips out the heart of the  Belfast Agreement• Book Review: Unionist leaders should read this vital defence of NI’s place in UK• Writers Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Wisconsin and Missouri were among the latest states to confirm cases.But Delta remains the dominant iant, making up more than % of cases and driving a surge of hospital admissions in the north..removeNational Guard teams have been sent to help overwhelmed hospitals in western New York, and Massachusetts Gov Charlie Baker issued an emergency order requiring any hospitals facing limited patient capacity to reduce scheduled procedures that are not urgent.US officials continued urging people to get vaccinated and to receive booster shots, as well as take precautions such as wearing masks when among strangers indoors, saying anything that helps protect against delta will also help protect against other iants.EvenOmicron proves less dangerous than Delta, it remains problematic, World Health Organisation epidemiologist Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said.ldquoEvenwe have a large number of cases that are mild, some of those iniduals will need hospitalisations, she said.ldquoThey will need to go into ICU and some people will die. We donrsquot want to see that happen on top of an already dficult situation with Delta circulating globally.Two years into the outbreak, Covid- has killed more than , Americans, and deaths are running at about  per day.More than , new hospital admissions are being reported daily, according to tracking data from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.Covid- cases and deaths in the US have dropped by about half since the Delta peak in August and September, but at more than , new infections per day, the numbers are still high, especially heading into the holidays, when people travel and gather with family..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Fauci says early reports  uencouraging u about Omicron iant article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon will benefit from greenway works in Dromore and secure cycle parking, bike repair stands and cycle counters.Mrs Kelly said: “The announcement of an additional £m funding from SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon will benefit projects and people locally and across the North. Since becoming a minister, Nichola Mallon has made greenway and active travel projects a key priority for her and it’s great to see this delivery building on the success of other projects in this area. “In Upper Bann, cycle parking facilities and its usage have been generally very low but a large proportion are located on private land for customer use. However, the potential cycle parking solutions considered by Council offers a higher level of cycle parking given the visibility and security of the locations, followed by off street car parks, parks and then within the existing footways of the town centre. “The fact that SDLP Minister Mallon received more applications for funding than anticipated demonstrates the popularity of these projects and schemes across the North.“ The coronavirus pandemic highlighted the importance of having local greenways and outdoor spaces that people can enjoy and this funding commitment from the Minister will improve the lives of communities across the North. “The SDLP is determined to deliver the projects that matter to local people and I’m delighted to see SDLP Minister Mallon continue in this vein.” New hospital for Craigavon in limbo as Departments of Health and Finance wrangle over costEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.
