But this will only be achieved if drivers are supported to charge their vehicles typically at off-peak times.‘Support for drivers using their electric vehicles in novel ways will also be needed, for example by “vehicle-to-grid” technology to share energy from car batteries back to the electricity grid when it is needed.’ Ofgem envisages the number of electric vehicles will surge from 230,000 today to ten million by 2030 and 39million by 2050. It argues this will only be possible if the current total of 30,000 public car chargers rises to 210,000, plus 3,500 rapid and ultra-rapid chargers near motorways.         It is suggested that building and running the infrastructure to support the roll-out of electric vehicles could be £2billion a year, equivalent to £30 on every household bill (stock image)At the same time, traditional natural gas central heating and hot water systems will have to be ripped out of millions of homes.These will be replaced with electric heating and, potentially, a new gas system run on hydrogen, where the only emissions are water.The regulator said: ‘The future of heating is less certain, with a range of possible different pathways to decarbonise.‘In 2017, just 4.5 per cent of the energy used for heating the UK’s 29million homes and other non-residential buildings was from a low-carbon source.‘This number needs to rise significantly by 2050.’ Ministers should consider charging farmers per ton of carbon produced by their land, a report released by wildlife charities has said.

He was invited there by a curator whose stipulation was that he make work on the theme of sex and mortality.“Mexico’s anarchic, visceral energy got under my skin and sucked me in,” he recalls. “There is an acceptance that life has no glorious victory, no happy ending. Humour, ritual, a strong sense of community and an embrace of the inevitable make it possible to live with tragic and often unacceptable situations.”Hugo’s approach shifted accordingly to reflect the flamboyance and gritty ordinariness of life there, his images filled with vibrant colours and often mysterious symbolism. This portrait is a case in point. Entitled The Wedding Gift, it shows a young bride in Juchitán de Zaragoza cradling an iguana, a creature considered a symbol of patience, understanding and kindness in Mexico. Conversely, the elaborately competitive mating rituals performed by the male of the species – head-bobbing, nudging, biting and even changing colour – have been mimicked in local song and dance, including a famous traditional ballet, La Iguana de Guerrero.Whatever the symbolism, the young woman seems perfectly at ease holding a lizard in her lap, her direct-to-camera gaze giving little away. Hugo is also noncommittal, refusing to reveal her age or comment on what he calls “the iguana tableau”. From the start, Hugo’s work has been characterised by degrees of ambiguity: his most famous series, The Hyena and Other Men, shot with an itinerant troupe of street performers and their captive beasts in Nigeria. His approach, which merges documentary, street photography and staged portraiture, has led to accusations that he exoticises, even exploits, his subjects, though his photographs are often created through sustained creative collaboration with his sitters.In his Mexican portraits and landscapes,about to go on show at a London gallery, the mood moves between the heightened everyday and the grotesque: weatherbeaten peasants in work clothes, a woman dressed like Frida Kahlo, corpulent nudes, blood-covered faces and a man wearing a crown of thorns. Nothing is ever entirely what it seems, the complex nature of Mexican culture reflected through an outsider’s eyes as a mixture of ritual, role-playing and various degrees of exaggerated reality. “I am drawn,” says Hugo, “to the fabulousness of the banal and the banality of the exotic.” In Mexico, he found his perfect location.Pieter Hugo: La Cucaracha is at Huxley-Parlour Gallery, London, W1 from 19 Feb to 14 Mar"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6065cd68e0358033160a7ba08984bf6f4e118955/0_558_2393_1435/master/2393.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e5f664f1ecc5bbde668ae75c0e45bd2","title":"hollywood hounds canine film stars in pictures","story":"It was meeting a collie called Hey Hey, a direct descendant of the first dog to play Lassie, that gave author and film journalist Wendy Mitchell the idea for her new book, Citizen Canine: Dogs in the Movies. “I would melt into floods of tears when I saw a dog on screen,” she says, and so she created a book celebrating famous dog performances in Hollywood history, from Chaplin’s co-star Scraps in A Dog’s Life to the great Dane in Marmaduke.

After the UK’s departure from the EU on Friday, both sides are expected to set out their negotiating positions on Monday before trade talks next month.“We want our UK team of more than 7,000 people to have the best possible chance of future success, which is why we continue to urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.”Sunderland is the UK’s largest car factory and employs 6,000 workers. It makes three of Nissan’s five flagship models – the Qashqai, the Juke and the electric Leaf.Under the contingency plan, production of the Micra, which is made in France, would be moved to the UK and Nissan would reconsider producing the X-Trail in Sunderland. A year ago, it decided not to make the new version of the X-Trail in Sunderland, citing Brexit uncertainty.David Bailey, the professor of industrial strategy at Aston Business School, said Nissan’s plan was likely to be only one of multiple options and did not signal a vote of confidence in Britain’s prospects in the event of a hard Brexit.“Nissan has certainly been doing scenario modelling and it’s not clear how current this planning is,” he said.“It’s one possible response to the hard Brexit scenario but I don’t think it’s a feasible plan.”He said carmakers with operations in Europe would have to reconfigure their operations, potentially resulting in some models being built in Britain that were not previously. However, he said this would not always work to the UK’s advantage.“You would see production shift in both directions. Some production would come to the UK for the UK market and some would go to Europe.“Given the size of the European market, the size of the movement that way would be much greater, so overall it would be a hit to UK automotive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ce420f6bda83e9aa0280ff7689685e6381e8618/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c937f48f9adf15fbb1dd2fd3d17e0c62","title":"joaquin phoenix baftas speech racism boycott suzanne moore","story":"Joker star Joaquin Phoenix was right to attack ‘systemic racism’ in the film industry, but wrong to even collect his best actor awardSo, Joaquin Phoenix.

The words Sonic and trailer haven’t had the smoothest of relationships, with the first footage revealing a horrifyingly humanoid hedgehog who had fans screaming for it to be burned. Instead, he was re-tooled but the latest spot, showing a range of athletes heaping praise on Sonic’s speed, is the sign of a marketing team unsure just what the hell they’re doing. During one scene, the tortured star James Marsden asks “What am I doing?” and it genuinely feels like an outtake.The full-length version of the Super Bowl spot has a lot for us to take in. Vin Diesel has a brother! That brother is John Cena! Charlize Theron is back! And she’s in a perspex cage! There’s a magnet plane or something! Whatever that is! How did we get to the ninth Fast \u0026amp Furious film? Does that make any rational sense? Do we all still want to see this when it comes out in the summer? Yes!The film that’s almost kind of just about maybe almost been happening for decades now is finally coming out this summer. A sequel to a hit that didn’t seem like it needed a sequel – but here we are, months away from the release of Top Gun: Maverick. It’s the first previously unreleased film ad tonight and it offers what we might expect and little else … but here’s hoping it proves its existence by the time June comes.Continuing the Pacinossance that began with the one-two punch of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Irishman, Amazon’s fact-based thriller series Hunters looks set to give us a lot of Al – maybe, just maybe, too much? After years of thankless paycheque roles that pushed the actor further and further into the realm of parody, this new look at the Jordan Peele-produced show focused on Nazi killers has him screaming in a German accent, which I’m hoping isn’t indicative of the overall noise level of his performance.A thunderously loud trailer here for A Quiet Place Part II that starts with a couple of shocks: first that John Krasinski, back as director, is also returning as a star and second that his appearance is closely followed by a seat-ejecting arrival from one of those noise-loathing aliens. It’s a ferociously impressive tease for a sequel that many of us thought felt unnecessary, hinting that many of us might be very wrong.A necessary insertion here from Disney, continuing the cartoon-to-live-action machine with Mulan, arguably its riskiest bet so far. It’s a genre switch-up of sorts, with the film set to be more of a historical action adventure, a far cry from the more kid-friendly magic of Disney’s previous efforts. The latest tease promises again to bring us some rousing sequences, though, and serves as a vital reminder that not all Disney heroines are waiting for a man to save them.One of the most anticipated ads of the game gives us a closer look at Marvel’s belated solo adventure for Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow. It’s not a great deal different to the trailer that already launched but it does reintroduce that wonderful “warped guitar” noise as well as remind us that the Oscar nominee Florence Pugh is starring in a big old blockbuster, so it’s hard not to love it.This year, the record-breaking $5.6m price-tag for a 30-second spot has left some studios choosing to sit this one out while others, such as Paramount, have used their time to poke fun at the sky-high entry fee. The SpongeBob movies have always felt akin to a fever dream, a manic rush of images, ideas and one-liners, and this brief tease suggests that the next shall be more of the same, with added cameos from Snoop Dogg and Keanu Reeves, because sure.A semi-surprise reveal here for a solid tease of the 25th James Bond film, which appears to be more plot-heavy than most, following on from the underwhelming Spectre and bringing back characters other than 007 himself.

Small firms play a critical role, as they offer nine out of 10 apprenticeships for 16- to 24-year-olds, according to the Federation of Small Businesses.This means that the number of people starting an apprenticeship since May 2015 has reached just over 2 million. During the general election campaign in May 2015, the Conservative party manifesto pledged to create 3m new apprenticeships by 2020, but if current trends continue, the government will miss this target.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are investing significantly to level up skills and opportunity across the country and apprenticeships are playing a key role in this.“We recognise there is more work to do and we are continuing to look at how the apprenticeship programme can best support the changing needs of businesses so more people can get ahead and all employers can benefit.”The two business groups said in a new report on apprenticeships that the system is confusing for employers in particular, transferring unused levy funds is complicated and time consuming, as they cannot be block transferred but must be transferred on a month-by-month basis.In addition, the funds cannot be spent to cover the administrative costs of hiring apprentices, which can be significant for smaller firms and for the most part, transfers can only fund new starts.The report says the restrictions mean that big companies such as the construction firm Mace are struggling to transfer their unused funds. “If the levy-transfer process were to function optimally, this would result in over £400m transferred to non-levy paying SMEs in the construction industry.”London First and NWBLT are calling for greater flexibility for businesses in how they use funds, allowing them to support a broader range of training activities, and how funds are transferred to other firms.Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, said: “Many firms want to take on more apprentices but are hamstrung by a needlessly complex and inflexible system.”The Federation of Small Businesses warned that the apprenticeship system and in particular small firms are “facing a crisis”. Its national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “Urgent action is needed to ensure sufficient funding for small businesses in order to be able to continue offering apprenticeships.Kirstie Donnelly, interim chief executive of City \u0026amp Guilds, said the stigma around apprenticeships must be stamped out. “More must be done now to promote apprenticeships both within schools and, more generally, amongst the public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb492eddcace54c2e7e6cf90765e40db335a0a5/0_70_4518_2711/master/4518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4485dbff6b9261cccc1c6859d76d22cd","title":"saving the planet uk role vital if cop 26 climate talks to succeed","story":"As PM announces Glasgow plan, much diplomatic work remains to be doneBoris Johnson’s first steps on the international stage after Brexit will be to hail Britain’s role in forging a new global consensus on the climate crisis – although he has not yet said who will lead that charge.The UK will host the crunch UN climate talks, COP 26, this November in Glasgow, in what experts say is the last chance for international cooperation on the crisis. The prime minister, in launching the UK’s strategy for the talks on Tuesday, stops short of promising to “get climate done”, but in making his own involvement clear he will at least reassure climate activists and governments concerned at a hitherto confused and chaotic start to the UK’s presidency.Late on Friday, the Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings intervened to sack the former minister who had been slated to lead the talks, Claire Perry O’Neill. She was accused of numerous failures in her dealings with officials, her own and those from other countries, and deemed not to have enough clout or persuasion to bring reluctant countries into the fold.No replacement has yet been announced, with rumours swirling of a Whitehall power struggle. The COP 26 unit is within the Cabinet Office, but needs strong relationships with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and with the Department for Business, Energy \u0026amp Industrial Strategy. But the confusion over how the talks will be led and managed has left bystanders, including the UN, the EU and other major countries, bemused.Johnson’s re-assumption of control was essential, according to Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, and a veteran of the UN talks. “Time is running out fast, but if the prime minister takes an interest and puts his weight behind the required diplomacy, then the UK can still salvage COP 26,” he said.The task ahead is huge. The Paris accord of 2015 marked the first time that rich and poor nations came together resolving to hold global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably 1.5C, which scientists say is the limit of safety. But the Paris pledges to curb carbon emissions are inadequate. This year, governments must scale up their ambition or face climate breakdown within the decade.According to Tom Burke, founder of the environmental group E3G, who attended the first ever UN climate COP, the next few months are crucial. “It’s not what you’re going to do in September, October that’s too late. It’s what you’re doing in March and April that will make the difference.”The government’s strategy encompasses all the diplomatic and economic expertise the UK can bring to bear, from ambassadorial schmoozing in capitals from Dhaka to DC, to boardroom influence in major banks. The Prince of Wales and Prince William will also weigh in, with Charles gathering business leaders almost monthly to press them to make changes.While the UK has an enviable global network of diplomats and “soft power”, it also faces a unique difficulty. Brexit means that even while British representatives are pushing the climate agenda, separate trade negotiators are talking to the same foreign governments – in some cases even the same people in those governments – about trade deals. Several experts said they feared it would be difficult to combine the two.“Call me sceptical that Boris Johnson’s government will confront Trump’s climate nihilism ahead of Glasgow while simultaneously having to beg him for a post-Brexit trade deal,” said Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House and close observer of COPs. “Boris’s Brexit will have international climate costs, starting with lack of pressure on the US, whose lack of leadership under Trump has allowed an ultra-dangerous global climate backslide.”The US will be tied up with its presidential election this year, and it may yet be possible to forge a deal that the US at least does not object to, even if active participation is unlikely.With regard to the other key country, China, Britain may have to rely on the negotiating might of the EU, which is arranging two major EU-China summits, in March and September, where the climate crisis will have top billing.As the last two decades of UN climate talks have shown, progress can sometimes be made even when big countries are reluctant to play ball. One of the greatest strengths of the UN process is that every country, from poorest to richest, has an equal say, and even the mightiest, from the US and China to the EU and India, have on occasion had to bow to the massed ranks of the poor and vulnerable.He believes the UK conference will be vital if the pledges made at Paris are to be fulfilled and the world is to avoid climate breakdown. “I live in Paris, I love Paris,” Birol said. “But I’m hoping to love Glasgow even more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1197ca4b53840acf560326224f16485184eeef/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ea584ee4f1c876098b7eb45318ca39e","title":"bags of style how accessories took over the red carpet","story":"From Jennifer Lopez’s ‘Stack O Cash’ to Billy Porter’s mechanical fringed hat, the stars’ clothes have been upstaged this awards season Hold onto your silver fringed, mechanical hats, because this award season, theatrical and brilliantly extra accessories have taken over red carpet style.At the Grammys there was a general ditching of the demure for the definitely fun: Billy Porter’s Sarah Sokol mechanical fringed hat which gave us material for a thousand hilarious memes, the statement manicures of Rosalía, Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish and Tyler the Creator’s hilariously cumbersome luggage case to compliment his pink Golf le Fleur bellhop outfit.A great accessory is a subtle and edgy way to elbow in inidual creativity into a sometimes stuffy institution. “I think there is a lot of pressure at the big shows not to take risks for fear of receiving harsh criticism,” says Jana Matheson, the chief creative officer at accessories designer Judith Leiber, whose designs have been seen at the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards. “On the flip side, because some have been going so safe, it’s been so much more fun to watch the fashion at the parties and the smaller events.”The best accessories feel like timely commentary, zeitgeisty and a moment all at once (think Lizzo’s micro Valentino bag at the American Music Awards). And it helps if they travel well on Instagram.The bejewelled, dollar-bill – so called “Stack O Cash” – clutch Jennifer Lopez was seen carrying at the Hustlers premiere was a great example of this. Featured in the film and a nod to the mid-00s styles from the era it was set, the clutch was three parts Jenny from the Block and one part red-carpet bling. “The concept for the Stack O Cash came directly from the emoji,” says Judith Leiber’s Jana Matheson, who made the purse. “We have been dabbling in many pop art inspired pieces, which also happened to be emojis – hotdogs, hamburgers, french fries.”They were also responsible for Billy Porter’s fringed purse at the Grammys and J-Lo’s pre-Superbowl American football clutch.The Stack O Cash, which was also carried by Beyoncé, worked because it feels like a throwback to a cash carrying time. “The Stack O Cash seemed particularly fun because of the nostalgic aspect of cash,” she says. “It won’t be long before people won’t carry actual paper money at all.”Are they designing anything for the upcoming Oscars ceremony? “Yes!!!!” says Matheson. We are crossing our fingers for a clutch replicating the Woozy face emoji.

The name change followed criticism from politicians and investors over working conditions at Sports Direct and the standard of corporate governance at the wider group.Mulberry bags can easily exceed £1,000.

She accused the woman of lying on multiple occasions, suggesting she manipulated Weinstein by giving him the impression she was sexually keen on him.“You manipulated Mr Weinstein every single time you saw him, isn’t that correct?” Rotunno said in a barrage of questioning. “Every time you engaged in consensual sexual encounters with him you manipulated him, isn’t that correct? You made him feel you wanted sexual relations with him.”The witness replied: “No, that is not correct.” is not naming the witness because she has not indicated publicly whether she is happy to be identified. Weinstein’s fate potentially revolves around her, as she forms a central pillar of the prosecution’s case.The fallen titan of Hollywood faces five counts that could see him punished with life imprisonment. Two of the counts are of rape and relate to the testimony of the anonymous accuser. Weinstein denies all accusations of non-consensual sex.On Friday, the court heard the woman, now 34, describe in graphic terms how the Hollywood producer, 67, allegedly raped her twice in the spring of 2013. After one of the alleged attacks, she said, she discovered a needle in a bathroom trash can that she later discovered to have contained a treatment for erectile dysfunction.Rotunno, a Chicago-based lawyer who specialises in defending men accused of sex crimes, has a reputation for being a fearsome cross-examiner. In many years of trial advocacy, she has only lost one case.Her team promised in opening statements that it would refrain from victim shaming – a strategy commonly pursued by defendants in rape trials. Yet at poignant moments in the cross-examination, Rotunno came close to doing just that.Such a tactic could be high risk in front of a jury composed of New Yorkers in the era of #MeToo that was sparked in no small part by the allegations against the movie mogul. Weinstein was first accused by several women in October 2017.Today the roll call of women who have lined up to tell their stories of having been allegedly sexually abused and harassed by him stands at 105 women, but the accounts of nearly all of them will not be part of the evidence in this trial.In grilling of the four other women who have testified at the Weinstein trial, Rotunno has suggested they have a financial interest in bringing him down. She has asked witnesses if they have personal lawyers and whether they intend to sue the defendant once this trial is over.But she has never before been as blunt as to portray the accuser sitting in the witness stand as a liar and a manipulator. Prosecutors have already told the jury the woman sustained contact with Weinstein over five years, engaging in willing sexual encounters even after the alleged rapes took place in New York in 2013.Rotunno drilled into that aspect of her account, showing to the witness and then the jury a series of emails the witness exchanged with the film producer. In one email, sent in July 2014, more than a year after the incidents for which Weinstein is charged, the woman told him her mother was in town and “she’d love to meet you. Plus you can see how good my genes are.”The witness explained to the jury that at the time her mother had been pressuring her for an audience with the celebrity.“My mom made me do it,” she said.In one particularly intense exchange, Rotunno said that despite alleged rapes “you stuck around for the rest of 2013, the rest of 2014, the rest of 2015, the rest of 2016”. The woman paused for a long time and then said: “I engaged with my abuser because … he kept threatening me and it was always in my best interest. I wanted to know I was OK.”At other moments Rotunno accused the woman of lying when she faked an orgasm after he insisted on giving her oral sex.“You lied to Mr Weinstein when you faked the orgasm,” the attorney said.“Yes,” the woman replied.“The emails you constantly send with requests to see him on a regular basis,” Rotunno said. “You manipulated Harvey Weinstein.”After another long pause, the woman responded: “How I handled it, to survive, I guess we could say ‘manipulation’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce25dcd6c1d1cf55dd60cb01bbc2fe03cee0d35d/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebf02b7ad57ebfd7e34b32df8ce4c0fe","title":"stuart heritage baftas selfies scarlett red carpet","story":"Surely the Baftas couldn’t be as bad as they look on TV? ’s intrepid reporter hit the red carpet to find outNot so long ago, I made plans to attend the Oscars. Whenever I mentioned this to people, you could measure their excitement in decibels. They’d scream. They’d shake. They’d generally behave like the extended family of an X Factor contestant who’d just been informed that they had qualified for bootcamp. It was terrifying.I never made it to the Oscars in the end. But this year I got another chance to experience the same sort of starstruck hysteria by attending the Baftas. Except things didn’t quite work out that way. “I’m going to the Baftas,” I’d tell people, and without fail they’d sort of screw up their nose in disappointment. If you’ve ever seen a child open a birthday card to discover that there isn’t any money in it, you’ll understand.It doesn’t make sense, because on paper the Baftas and the Oscars are basically the same thing. The same films are nominated. The same films win. The same people attend, for crying out loud. Attend the Baftas and you’re mixing with the same mix of A-list talent that attends the Oscars, albeit here they’re scared and freezing because they didn’t do a good job of figuring out what to wear in London in February. But still, in the eyes of many, the Baftas still feel a little bit like a booby prize.The reason for this, I think, is a simple one. The Baftas are a little bit rubbish. They’re dismal to watch on television. They’re slung out half-arsed on BBC One without any sort of televised red carpet coverage. And because they’re not shown live, the ceremony ends up occupying an unpleasant hinterland. If you care about awards season, you won’t watch the Baftas because you’ve already got the winners off Twitter. And if you don’t care about awards season, you won’t watch the Baftas because you don’t care about awards season.The ceremony itself can be hard to love, too. Last year’s show, for instance, was preposterously stupid. Whatever enthusiasm anyone had remaining after the bizarre Nasa-themed interpretive dance opener – presumably booked back when people thought First Man would be a contender – was roundly kicked to death by Joanna Lumley’s aggressively terrible rapid fire anti-joke rat-a-tat. (Of BlacKkKlansman she said: “I’m surprised that it did so well at the Klan film festival.”) As a result, viewers are shedding the Baftas like fleas from a dead dog. Last year’s show was watched by half a million fewer people than the year before, which would have been a shock had it not tracked against an overall longterm decline.But maybe we’ve all been missing something. Maybe the televised Baftas only tell half the story. Maybe there’s a whole world of excitement happening offscreen. Maybe you really have to be there in the flesh, in your best clothes, absorbing all the star wattage, to truly understand what they’re about.From my visit on Sunday, I’d argue that you do. Sort of. Going to the Baftas reveals an awful lot about the Baftas that you don’t get from the television coverage. The red carpet, for instance, looks incredibly glamorous on TV a long, slow procession of the most beautiful people on Earth at their most beautiful, being adored by a legion of screaming fans. And in reality there really is lots of screaming on the red carpet. It just doesn’t necessarily come from the fans.Because here’s what happens as soon as anyone sets foot on any red carpet in 2020. They stop walking. They turn around. They grab their phones. And they take, conservatively, several billion selfies. Everyone does this. An entire Albert Hall’s worth of people, all stopping and turning around and taking selfies for the internet. The entire Baftas red carpet is now just a weaponised hell-run of constant selfie-taking. And the people who bear the brunt of this narcissism are the security guards, who spend their entire evenings yelling things like “That’s enough selfies now ladies and gentlemen”, and “If we could all just start to make our way up the red carpet”, and “PLEASE STOP TAKING SELFIES” to tuxedo duckface adult humans who have chosen to become their own paparazzi. “Try this at Cannes and you’d be rugby tackled to the ground,” a friend whispered as we attempted to navigate the mess.Inside the Albert Hall, though, things are different. When it starts to fill up, and when the stars take their seats in little clusters by the aisles, it’s hard to deny that there’s an energy you cannot hope to replicate on TV. You see little glimpses of personality sneak out from behind the personas. While on television you only got to see cutaway shots of dour-faced Quentin Tarantino, in the flesh you saw him happily chatting to friends before the show started. You could see nervous gulps, stifled yawns, distracted phone-checking. When Bombshell won for best makeup, and Anne Morgan’s dress briefly became tangled up in her chair, the first person in the entire auditorium to offer help was Laura Dern. That’s the glimpse of personality that I got from Laura Dern, the sense that Laura Dern is a saint among us and deserves nothing but good things from the world.But god, in their unedited form the Baftas are long. And god, your bottom really does start to get numb. The two standing ovations given to talent on Sunday – one for Andy Serkis and one for Kathleen Kennedy – felt to me less like spontaneous demonstrations of professional respect and more like a strategic opportunity for people to allow blood back into the lower half of their bodies for the first time in 90 minutes.Also, I couldn’t help but feel that the royal family came out of it especially badly. After three hours of being presented with beautiful, funny, talented winners and presenters, it felt like a horrible thud when Prince William charisma-sponged all the air out of the room by repeating a toothless version of Joaquin Phoenix’s speech in a flat monotone. Now that Harry has bolted for a lifetime of conventional celebrity, it’s probably time to start asking what the royals are actually for. On the basis of the Baftas, that question might not have an answer.Once the ceremony ended, and the winners were invited back on stage for one final photograph, the best part of the entire evening happened. Everyone was shoved outside to be bundled into a standing row of gussied-up National Express-style coaches, waiting to transport us all to the aftershow dinner. Seriously: take that, the Oscars. You might have glitz and glamour and perfect weather and global attention, but ask yourself this: do you have a rail replacement bus service for the nominees? No, you do not. One-nil to the Baftas.Also, I don’t know if this was standard across the entire Bafta fleet, but our bus driver treated us to a 20-minute deadpan standup set during our trip, that bordered on outright abuse. One joke he told was this: “Are you stars? You’re not stars. Whoever told you that you were stars was lying.” If that wasn’t the case – if I was on the only bus to actively heckle its passengers – then I would strongly suggest rolling it out as standard next year.And then it was dinner, which I have chosen to interpret as a reminder on behalf of the universe that I am not nearly as special as I think I am. Imagine, if you will, a table plan that resembles the solar system. In the middle you have the sun, a cluster of all the biggest names whose gravitational pull holds the whole thing together. Then, orbiting that, you have the supplementary players the presenters and winners and guests whose appearance was counted as a highlight by the powers that be. And then on the outskirts of that, you have sponsors and their guests, along with other monied well-wishers. And then there’s a flight of stairs, and more tables, and then another bunch of stairs that mark the frozen outer edges of the solar system. And then, beyond that, there was me. On table 177. In short, I was Pluto. Yes, I was wearing a bow-tie. Yes, I was technically eating food in the same room as Charlize Theron. But nevertheless, scientists will spend decades arguing whether or not I qualified as actually taking part in the Baftas dinner. Genuinely, the only people sitting further away from the action than me were the people who wrote Graham Norton’s monologue. “Someone hates you,” a friend told me when she saw where I was sitting. She had been sitting on table 47. Imagine.By the time our food was served, the stars had already upped and left for the afterparty. By the time I got to the afterparty, the stars had bounced on to the Netflix party, because that’s where Rihanna was. And, quite honestly, who could blame them? If the Baftas taught me one thing above anything else, it’s that being famous looks quite pants. Not only were the stars screamed at and scrutinised for the entire duration of the evening, but it’s easy to forget that the Baftas were just another stop-off on a rolling thunder revue of an awards season for them. Sunday was the Baftas. Saturday was the WGA awards. Thursday was the Artios awards, Wednesday the visual effects awards, Tuesday the Costume Designers Guild awards, Monday the Oscars luncheon. All these events come with their own set of expectations red carpets, monologues, polite applause, dinners that have been designed to feed a thousand people at once. It looks exhausting, and not in the least bit fun. And the feeding frenzy that follows them around is absurd.As I left the dinner, all the selfie-takers from earlier were tearing apart the table displays so that they could go home with a trinket. One man almost lost his balance yanking a plastic peach from a table that Scarlett Johansson may or may not have touched. It was like watching people trying to rescue their loved ones from a burning house. It looked like looting. And that’s the moral I’m taking from the Baftas. Make something good and you have to dedicate three months of your life to this sort of idiocy. Here’s to a lifetime of mediocrity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73ec07f7e883d957dc6271b5024aeebd6a2722cd/180_208_3248_1948/master/3248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e41e5d3e8ba0c65e4165d45248dcc69","title":"who should have presented this years oscars 2020","story":"As the Academy Awards go presenter-less for the second year running, we imagine what might have beenA charisma overload, the nicest guy in Hollywood, the obvious choice.

It said the latest figure compares with 250,000 participants in 2019 and 170,000 in 2018.Signatories now come from every country in the world except North Korea, Vatican City and Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), the group said.In addition, many more people are thought to have taken part in the event without signing the official pledge, and many are expected to continue with plant-based diets beyond January.Manufacturers, supermarkets, restaurants and pub chains are now tapping into not only the burgeoning vegan market but also “flexitarians”, who enjoy meat but want to reduce their meat consumption.Toni Vernelli, a Veganuary spokesperson, said: “With the link between animal farming and the climate crisis making headlines nearly every day, we expected Veganuary 2020 to be the biggest yet, but it exceeded all our expectations. We applaud everyone who took part and encourage them to continue eating vegan food as often as possible.”In the UK alone hundreds of new plant-based products and menu items were launched this January – including the first Veganuary offerings from the fast-food giants KFC, McDonald’s and Burger King. Sales in many cases exceeded expectations.Pret a Manger launched its first vegan croissant in stores in early January and is now selling twice as many a day as the non-vegan jam croissant.Also this year, Veganuary launched its first TV advert which aired on major networks in five countries, including Sky News in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f2664be7f8bca906a492555ceff236234bd55a/586_481_1374_825/master/1374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7863930a5557988beacff576dc0e251","title":"spurs stun city liverpool march on and neymars flick costs him football weekly","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Jacob Steinberg, and Flo Lloyd-Hughes look at the race between second, third and fourth, whether or not the grass is too long in Burnley and another Leeds lossJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Joe Montemurro’s side are now outsiders in the race after losing to their nearest rivals in quick succession, and they badly missed Kim Little on Sunday. She did not even make the bench, presumably due to a knock, and it meant their link from back to front was badly disrupted. Vivianne Miedema became isolated as a result and, with Lia Walti’s absence in front of the back four also keenly felt, a lack of strength in depth was exposed again. They rallied after going two goals down but, one fine save apart, Ellie Roebuck was not tested often enough in the City goal and they will have to find a way to recover from this.It was a great way for Nick Cushing to sign off from his time at City, though, after winning six major trophies with them. He leaves for the US on Wednesday and has big shoes to fill, but it is a fantastic legacy for his successor to build on. His team had to battle it out against Arsenal in a feisty game with little relaxed, flowing football, but they deserved their goals from Pauline Bremer and Lauren Hemp – and now need to keep winning with a potential title shoot-out against Chelsea just around the corner.Chelsea are playing a scintillating brand of football at the moment and it is simply brilliant to watch. They showed that again in pummelling West Ham, scoring eight times with six different players on target and the momentum they have built up looks irresistible. The title seemed almost out of reach for them earlier in the season but they are on a superb run now and look hard to stop. Would anyone be brave against them going on to win the domestic treble?A narrow defeat at Brighton was tough for Everton to swallow. Did a little complacency creep in? It feels as if Willie Kirk has instilled a bit of swagger into them, in a positive way, and that a sense of confidence and identity has returned. They would have travelled to the south coast expecting to win, particularly on the back of a productive transfer window. Perhaps this was a bit of a reality check: a reminder that you need to respect every team you play. There is a sense that the good times are on the way back but you still need to graft out a result sometimes, and that was definitely the case this weekend. Next up for them is a local derby with Liverpool at Goodison Park and Kirk will be expecting a fiery response.Brighton deserve a lot of credit though. Their gameplan worked and their match-winner, Aileen Whelan, again showed how important she is to them. They look as if they are pulling away from the relegation zone and can start looking at stabilising themselves in mid-table. Hope Powell has done a very good job and their long-term plan is, at current rate, bearing fruit.There are two particular issues that have driven women’s players in top leagues to distraction down the years and one of them reared its head at Adams Park. Reading’s equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United came about when Katie Zelem bravely headed a free-kick over her own bar. It was inexplicably interpreted as a handball, leading to a penalty that Fara Williams converted, and even in real time it is hard to make any case for the decision. What it comes down to is that the quality of officiating has simply not moved with the sport. The referees themselves are underpaid and it’s not fair anyone – including the refs themselves– to have sub-standard officials thrust into the profile women’s football has now gained.Every game has cameras present every clip will be circulated online to a potential audience of millions there is no hiding place. The league is now fully professional and it is time the refereeing kept pace. This is a problem that has been bubbling away for years but, when you are a professional who spends all week training to give your all on the pitch, you expect better and come to feel let down. The only silver lining is that an incident like this might shame those in charge into making things better.The other issue that drives us mad? The quality of too many WSL pitches. Spurs’ match with Bristol City at the Hive was postponed, as was Liverpool’s meeting with Birmingham at Prenton Park both surfaces were waterlogged and it can’t escape the attention that those stadiums each host home fixtures for three teams across the men’s and women’s games. Quite simply, neither pitch is conducive to good football and they cannot be considered permanent solutions for WSL teams next season.Liverpool’s situation is particularly disappointing. They have ticked the boxes for the FA’s licensing criteria, sure, but it hardly took an expert to see that the pitch would be a problem as the season progressed. I feel they have underinvested in their women’s team right across the board, and they are getting a taste now that people do care and that “it’ll do” just isn’t enough. They wouldn’t take that attitude with the men’s team – it wouldn’t even be a discussion – and that’s why the Premier League table looks as it does. You have to speculate to accumulate in women’s football at the moment, otherwise nothing develops. Liverpool were a title-winning club a few years ago and have been a top-tier club for so long, but they they have not put a proper infrastructure together at a time when their city rivals, Everton, are achieving exactly that. They are doing themselves and the sport a disservice, and the weekend’s issues were a further reminder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa19e996c455c246dacc35e4e3f6b2ee0a8af34d/0_396_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dad2fc0484829a04824ecdb46661b7e","title":"how we met he was trying to chat up my 82 year old granny","story":"Growing up together, Robyn and Wes had never considered the possibility of a romantic relationship. “He was a good friend of my older sister at school,” says Robyn. “And our families lived in the same village in north Devon.”The four-year age gap meant they didn’t see much of each other during their teens. “I do remember seeing Rob when she’d started university and she was really into politics. She was ranting about communism,” says Wes, laughing.It wasn’t until Christmas 2018 that their relationship began to change, when Wes paid a drunken visit to her family home. “Everyone had gone to bed at my house and I wanted to carry on the party,” he explains. Although he believes there was “some chemistry” that night, she wasn’t so sure. “I think he thought he was being charming and was trying to chat up my 82-year-old granny,” she recalls. “But he couldn’t even stand up. We had to put him to bed.”A week later the pair went to a New Year’s Eve party in Bristol, where they were living. “It was a coincidence that we had both chosen that city to move to,” says Robyn, “but it’s very popular with young people from our area.”It wasn’t long before they were chatting and laughing together. Their friends realised there was a spark there, but Robyn was oblivious. “I’d sworn off men after coming out of a bad relationship,” she says. “I’d gone out for a fun night with friends and it wasn’t on my radar at all.” Reading different signals, Wes leaned in for a kiss at midnight. “I told him it had better not be a pity kiss. I thought he felt sorry for me.”After they had ironed out that misunderstanding, they spent the rest of the evening together. “My sister was at the party and asked if I’d been kissing Wes,” says Robyn. “I denied it but I had lipstick marks all over my face, so I had to confess in the end. She found the idea of us together weird at first but came round to it.”In January the pair went on their first date, to a local pub. “I was panicking because I was late,” says Wes. “I saw a scooter rider get knocked off his bike on the way and I was first on scene to help.” The rider wasn’t seriously injured, but Wes admits he hammed up the story for Robyn. “I told her I’d saved someone’s life.”Even without that, they had plenty to talk about. “We had a lot of the same friends and it all felt very easy and natural,” says Robyn. It wasn’t long before they became an official couple. In September they made the decision to move in together, and now live Wes’s flat. “We’re like an old married couple,” Robyn says.Wes says he is “a really enthusiastic” cook. “I’m going to start Slimming World thanks to his cooking,” Robyn laughs. They also love exploring Bristol and travelling. “Last year we went to Milan and Croatia we’re saving for a trip to New York.”Robyn works for a local water company, while Wes is an account manager for a coffee roastery. “When I met Rob she was drinking instant coffee with sweeteners,” says Wes. “Now I’ve turned her into a coffee snob.”Describing his girlfriend as “one of the funniest people” he knows, Wes says they always have fun together. “She loves me for who I am now, not for my potential, and that’s a really nice feeling.” For Robyn it’s her partner’s upbeat nature that made her fall for him. “I call him my sunshine man. I feel like I can be myself around him – which I’ve never found before.” The relationship came at the right time for her. “In 2016 I lost my best friend to suicide, which was really hard,” she explains. “I was getting myself back together but finding a new love has given me a new lease of life.” Though the couple think they will move back to Devon in future, Robyn says they want to enjoy city life first. “We’re enjoying our lives at the moment and making the most of being together.”• Want to share your story?

But confirmation of the increase has extra potency this year, as most over-75s will have to start paying for their licence fees from this summer onwards.The culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, will give a speech on Wednesday on the future of media and broadcasting, in which she is expected to launch a consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee.Compliance with the fee is currently enforced through the criminal court system. The last time the government looked at turning non-payment into a civil matter – similar to non-payment of an electricity bill, enforced by bailiffs – it concluded that the change would cost the BBC hundreds of millions of pounds.The corporation is already facing an editorial boycott from the government, with ministers refusing to appear on leading shows such as Radio 4’s Today programme, in protest at the corporation’s news coverage during the general election.Spending plans agreed in 2015 are only just making themselves felt in the form of cuts to the BBC’s news output announced last week, and any further reduction in spending would be likely to harm the corporation even further.The number of active television licences in the UK fell slightly last year for the first time in decades, suggesting a small number of households could be choosing to stop paying.The BBC emphasises that although the £13.13 monthly cost is more than the price of commercial services such as Netflix, it provides a wider range of public service universal services including nine national TV channels 10 national radio stations, 40 local radio stations, plus the BBC website.Despite this, there are growing calls for reform of the system, including from some of the BBC’s highest-profile presenters. Last week Gary Lineker told the  he backed decriminalisation. The Match of the Day presenter is paid £1.75m a year by the corporation – the equivalent of 7p a year from every household that pays the licence fee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4378a13510c99161fb296f42103b5c7821ae1c3f/0_208_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8583f64190992e9b593009a5f246c916","title":"ermonela jaho steven maughan review wigmore hall","story":"Wigmore Hall, LondonThe Albanian soprano’s remarkable ability to get inside the mind of a character made this recital a very special occasionErmonela Jaho’s Wigmore Hall debut recital with pianist Steven Maughan marked the 50th anniversary of the founding of Opera Rara, with whom Jaho has done some of her finest work to date. Her programme, combining French and Italian songs with operatic arias, paid tribute to the Italian soprano Rosina Storchio (1872-1945), as famed in her lifetime for singing Violetta in La Traviata as Jaho is now, and creator of both Leoncavallo’s Zazà and Puccini’s Madama Butterfly, roles that the Albanian soprano has also made her own in recent years.Jaho’s artistry is rooted in a deep identification with her chosen repertoire that results in performances of unsparing veracity and tremendous emotional honesty. In recital, as on stage, her ability to expose a character’s psyche in seconds is utterly remarkable. We really sensed the desperation behind the seductive pianissimos with which Massenet’s Sapho attempts to reclaim her errant lover, and the sheer terror of Mascagni’s Iris as she recounts her dream of a sea monster consuming her. Tears, meanwhile, poured down Jaho’s face during the death scene from Mascagni’s Lodoletta, with its harrowing climactic cries of “Io t’amo” before hope and life ebb away.The mood, however, was by no means pervasively tragic, and elsewhere there was joy in Bizet’s Chanson d’Avril and a gentle sensuality in Gounod’s lovely Sérénade, its melismatic coloratura exquisitely negotiated. For once, meanwhile, the operatic extracts didn’t lose their impact when performed with piano. Maughan was a fine, forthright accompanist and gave us some appealingly elegant salon waltzes by Leoncavallo and Giordano when Jaho was away from the platform. A most distinguished recital, wonderfully done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145b4ccd66fbe45b636980696ed533bf53e366e5/0_370_1981_1188/master/1981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47f1b43ed31e6233133362052851035a","title":"how we made free by ultra nate","story":"She studied by day, went clubbing by night – then wrote the house anthem that launched a thousand hen partiesI fell into club culture in my first year at university in Baltimore. During the week, I’d be in classes, studying medicine. At weekends, I’d be letting it all go in clubs to the sound of underground house. I met the DJ team the Basement Boys and when they found out I sang in church, we started writing songs. Things got pretty surreal when the first, It’s Over Now, was a hit in the UK, where club culture was driving the charts. One day I was in medical school the next I was flying to London to do Top of the Pops.After a few more hits in Britain, the major UK label I was with relocated to the US. But the American end didn’t get underground house and dropped me. When I signed with Strictly Rhythm, an independent label in New York, they basically gave me a blank cheque. I teamed up with producers Mood II Swing and we discussed my comeback. I wanted guitars, because I was really into REM’s Losing My Religion. We wanted a rock song that would work in clubs, so the guitar line and the first verse (“Where did we lose our faith?”) pull at your heartstrings, then it erupts into a clubby anthem. It was intentionally very different from what was happening in dance music.Some people think Free is autobiographical, about me being “set free” by the major label, but it isn’t. We just needed a short phrase that would connect with everyone. Lem went: “It needs to be something like, ‘You’re free to do what you want to do.’ And everyone went, ‘That’s it!’”Little Louie Vega was the first DJ to play one of our red vinyl promotional copies. It was 1997 and it blew up in the clubs. I had no idea it would be such a global hit. It even got to No 1 in Italy. To this day, if I didn’t sing it at my concerts, people wouldn’t let me leave.When Ultra and I got together to write lyrics, we had a blast. I wrote the chorus, she did the verses, and then we worked on the bridge together. The words came flowing out. We’d talked about formulas in dance music and what labels wanted. We wanted to be free from that – which is partly where the chorus came from. Plus, I remember talking to Ultra about my personal life and feeling trapped by other people’s expectations. We were both in our 20s and feeling stuck in various ways.I asked Woody Pak, a guy I knew from the Manhattan School of Music, to play guitar. That hypnotic riff he opens the track with really grabs you. And we hired a vocal coach, Danny Madden, to do the chorus. We expected him to bring some session singers, but he walked in with all these as! Audrey Wheeler, Cindy Mizelle and Khadejia Bass were top backing singers who’d worked with David Bowie and Luther Vandross – and there they were singing the chorus with Ultra.I remember going: “What are we doing? We’ve got rock guitars, gospel background, jazzy chords and a simple house beat. This is crazy!” And I ran out of the session. Of course, when the record took off, I said: “I’m so sorry, guys!” I hadn’t travelled round Europe and had no idea that mixing genres would be so successful.Free was never political, but the gay community saw it as a song about empowerment and made it a huge anthem. But any group who wanted to be free could take it as their own. Headie One, the drill MC, recently sampled Free for his track Both. I don’t really know what drill music is, but it’s great that our song is still finding new audiences.• Strictly Rhythm’s 30th Anniversary: The Definitive 30 album is out now, and a 12-inch vinyl series is being released between now and March.

On Monday morning, the two sides began the arduous task of reconstructing a 47-year-old relationship based on trade, security, foreign policy and numerous technical policies.Michel Barnier, returning as EU chief negotiator, published the EU’s draft negotiating objectives, declaring them “nothing surprising”, as they repeated the EU’s long-stated principles. Less than an hour later, Boris Johnson began setting out the UK’s opening position, with a very different vision.A quick glance at both texts – the EU one here and the UK’s here – shows how much ides the two sides at the opening stage of talks, which are due to conclude by October, meaning the UK will exit the transition period on 31 December 2020.The EU has said the UK can have a zero-tariff, zero-quota, free trade agreement in exchange for “zero-dumping”, ie maintaining EU standards on workers’ rights, environmental protection and state aid. Barnier told journalists that Johnson agreed this point, when the prime minister signed the political declaration in October 2019, which states that “the future relationship must ensure open and fair competition, encompassing robust commitments to ensure a level playing field”. Barnier said there could not be “any surprise on the British side to hear that, if we are acting in good faith here”.But the UK government statement on negotiating objectives appears to spurn the agreement Johnson signed with EU leaders last October. “There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policies, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules,” it said.The EU envisages a limited agreement on services, covering telecoms, postal services and environmental services. The EU has said it will not negotiate on whether British-based financial firms can access EU markets, but will make a unilateral decision as to whether the sectors meet EU standards (an “equivalence” decision). Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, warned last week that British banks’ access to EU markets would be tied to an agreement on fishing.The government wants more ambitious arrangements for the City of London: it has called for a “predictable, transparent, and business-friendly environment for financial services firms” – a request at odds with EU equivalence that can be withdrawn at short notice. In contrast to the EU’s politicised linking of fish with financial services, the government states that the EU’s decision to grant equivalence should be “technical and confirmatory”, reflecting the reality that the UK will be operating under the same regulations.Fishing might be a tiny part of the overall economic relationship between the EU and UK but is likely to cause one of the biggest rows. The EU wants its fishing crews to maintain current levels of access to British waters with stable quotas. Barnier said a deal on fisheries would be “inextricably linked” to the trade agreement. EU officials have also tied the UK’s ability to sell seafood into the EU market to continued access to British fishing waters for European boats.Johnson is adamant that any new agreement should be based on the principle that “British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats”. The UK government also stresses that the UK will be “an independent coastal state by the end of 2020 and any agreement must reflect this reality”.The future role of the European court of justice is ambiguous in the EU’s opening position, which has contributed to negative headlines in the UK.The EU has said only the European court of justice can arbitrate on questions of European law, but has not spelled out any process for deciding what is a European law question, or whether it considers the Luxembourg court should be responsible for settling disputes in the future relationship between the EU and UK. Barnier said the ECJ “should be able to continue its role in full” concerning security issues, such as extradition and data-sharing.Downing Street insists there is no need for ECJ oversight of its trade deal, while the government has also said that any security agreement with the EU “must not constrain the autonomy of the UK’s legal system in any way”.The EU has also said future co-operation in security must rest on the UK’s continued membership of the European convention on human rights, the 1950 treaty that set up the European court of human rights, whose members  Albania to Ukraine.While the government has not proposed quitting the ECHR, the Strasbourg court is unpopular with Conservative Eurosceptics and Johnson’s righthand man, Dominic Cummings, called for a referendum on the ECHR before he joined the government.As long trailed, the EU has said the future relationship deal will not cover Gibraltar, a British overseas territory since 1713, claimed by Spain. The EU and UK could reach separate agreements on Gibraltar, but this will require approval from Madrid – a role reversal from the time when Spain, seeking to enter the European Economic Community in the 1980s, had to accept the status quo on Gibraltar.The government does not accept Gibraltar’s exclusion from the deal: it states it will “be acting on behalf of the UK crown dependencies and overseas territories: the whole UK family”.Both sides say they will be ready to discuss the UK’s participation in EU programmes, such as research and the Erasmus student exchange. The two sides also agree that these discussions can only take place once the EU has agreed its next seven-year budget (2021-27) – a politically fraught task that shows no sign of imminent resolution among the EU’s 27 member states.They also agree the talks could end without a free-trade deal. Barnier warned that “if we can’t manage a deal by the end of the year there will be a cliff-edge on many fronts”, naming trade in goods and fisheries.While Johnson said it was “emphatically not ‘deal or no deal’”, he also said the UK could accept a looser, Australian-style arrangement with the EU. Australia has limited agreements with the EU and mostly trades on World Trade Organization terms, although Canberra is seeking a free-trade agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb56e21013290738f21a76d998453b1a9f7ad6aa/0_158_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c62778e17340f7c511d4ab68fcdbc84","title":"labour leadership candidates urged to back electoral reform","story":"Clive Lewis to give speech calling for candidates to champion PRClive Lewis, the Labour shadow minister and former leadership candidate, is to urge those still in the race to embrace electoral reform, arguing that there are overwhelming moral and political reasons to ditch the first-past-the-post system.In speech on Tuesday night to a meeting of the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform, Lewis is expected to bemoan the fact that the party regularly flirted with the idea of proportional representation, only to ditch it when an election win seemed possible.“The narrative goes something like this: ‘Labour can’t win under first past the post – so we have to change the system,’” the Norwich South MP is expected to say in the speech in parliament, according to extracts released in advance.“This blip usually lasts as long as its takes to get to the incumbent government’s mid-term doldrums and the race to the next electoral finishing lines comes in to view. At which point you have to pretend you can win alone – even when its obvious you can’t. Support for PR then sinks until Labour does lose again. Play and repeat, ad infinitum.”Lewis, a shadow Treasury minister, argued for his party to embrace PR as part of his pitch to replace Jeremy Corbyn. He did not advance beyond the first stage of the race after failing to win enough nominations from fellow Labour MPs or MEPs.In the speech, Lewis will say the arguments for change can be summed up as an ”alliterative triptych of PR, which is – maths, morality and modernity”.Under first past the post, he is to argue, while it takes an average of 50,000 votes to elect each MP at the last general election, that varied from 38,000 for every Conservative representative, 336,000 per Lib Dem and 865,000 for the Greens’ sole MP.Lewis says Labour has resisted electoral reform because “the desire for so-called strong government combines with a deep sense of tribalism that sees anyone outside of Labour’s ranks, and indeed many people within Labour, as the enemy”.This was wrong, he is to say: “We back electoral reform not because it might be good for us but because it’s good for all of us. We back it because we believe in the equal and powerful voice of all. We hate wasted votes just as we hate wasted lives. We back it because we are democrats – unlocking all the voices.”First past the post is also anomalous in an increasingly complicated and interconnected world, Lewis will sayLewis will say he is “listening really hard to hear a candidate who really gets this, who doesn’t just back PR when pushed to but wants to make it a central issue to their leadership and really champion it”.Keir Starmer, the frontrunner to be the new leader, has called for a constitutional convention to address issues including “the fact that millions of people vote in safe seats and they feel their voice doesn’t count”.Among the other candidates, Rebecca Long-Bailey has also backed a constitutional convention without explicitly backing PR, while Emily Thornberry opposes the idea, arguing against moving to a system that is not based around constituency MPs. Lisa Nandy has supported PR in some ways, but has not backed arguing for it in general elections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb99c243d95a51cf6b215d9bf0b774f07dd43e77/0_78_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f18115d3244190eed975aa5f56d753cf","title":"political journalists boycott no 10 briefing after reporter ban","story":"Journalists in Downing Street walk out after Johnson aide tries to exclude some reportersPolitical journalists boycotted a Downing Street briefing on Monday after one of Boris Johnson’s aides banned selected reporters from attending.The confrontation took place inside No 10 after Lee Cain, Johnson’s most senior communications adviser, tried to exclude reporters from the Mirror, the i, HuffPost, PoliticsHome, the Independent and others from an official government briefing.At a time of escalating tensions between Downing Street and the media, Labour accused Johnson of deploying Donald Trump-like tactics to avoid scrutiny.The incident happened in the foyer of No 10 when journalists on the invited list were asked to stand on one side of a rug, while those not allowed in were asked by security to stand on the other side.When Cain told the banned journalists to leave, the rest of the journalists decided to walk out collectively rather than allow Downing Street to choose who scrutinises and reports on the government.Among those who refused the briefing on the UK’s trade negotiations with the EU were the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, ITV’s Robert Peston, and political journalists from Sky News, the Daily Mail, the , the Sun, the Financial Times and the .The briefing was due to be given by government officials, who are meant to be politically neutral, but did not happen because of the walkout.The tactics from No 10 echo those of Trump in the US, who has been known to try to exclude journalists from reporting on his activities, and represents an escalation of Johnson’s tensions with the media, which have been increasing in recent weeks.Johnson’s communications team has banned ministers from appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, boycotted ITV’s Good Morning Britain, and declined to appear on Channel 4 since before the election.Ministers have also been told not to have lunch with political journalists, and it was briefed at the weekend that Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s senior adviser, had established a “network of spies” to find out whether other special advisers were fraternising with the media.The BBC in particular is braced for a coming battle with the government after Johnson signalled during the election that he would consider scrapping the licence fee. A thinktank run by Cummings in 2004 advocated an end to the BBC’s funding model and described it as a “mortal enemy” of the Tory party.Broadcasters have also been unhappy that the prime minister’s Brexit day “address to the nation” was filmed by Downing Street rather than a crew from a TV network, as would usually be the case.Some of Johnson’s recent hires as special advisers include those with specialisms in film production and photography, prompting speculation that he is increasingly intending to bypass the media. The prime minister has recently launched so-called “people’s PMQs” sessions in which he reads out pre-vetted questions and answers them himself in an attempt to speak directly to the public.There have also been signs that No 10 is trying to shake up its relations with political journalists, who are collectively known as the lobby. Political journalists have already complained about No 10 changing the location of its daily briefings with the prime minister’s official spokesman from a room in parliament to Downing Street, meaning they are now held on government territory.There have previously been problems with some journalists being denied access, but these have largely been to political, rather than government, events. During the election campaign, the Mirror was excluded from following Johnson’s campaign on his battlebus after Tory complaints that its online coverage was not balanced.Earlier on Monday, Downing Street also limited access to Johnson’s keynote Brexit speech to one journalist per outlet, which meant some sketch writers who satirise the prime minister were unable to attend.After the walkout, a senior No 10 source said there had been a normal briefing for all lobby journalists after the prime minister’s speech and that the later one was a “smaller, selected briefing for specialist senior journalists”. The source said “a number of uninvited journalists barged into No 10 and demanded to be part of it” but were told they could not attend.The banned journalists who tried to attend the briefing had passed through Downing Street’s security scanners, shown their parliamentary passes and knocked on the door to gain entry. All the invited journalists were political editors rather than Brexit specialists.Labour said the move by Johnson’s team showed the prime minister was “resorting to tactics imported from Donald Trump to hide from scrutiny”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, raised a point of order about the No 10 walkout in the House of Commons, prompting Eleanor Laing, the deputy speaker, to say journalists must be treated with respect. “Press freedom is a cornerstone of our democracy and journalists must be able to hold the government to account,” said Brabin. “The future trade agreement with the European Union is an issue of great public importance and interest. Those gaining access to such important information should not be cherry-picked by No 10.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f586323f1dabbba52005640c4df696a4ff50475/0_87_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1750e7b7e3c3fb4bdb5d696ba6a975e2","title":"uk and eu set out contrasting goals for post brexit trade deal","story":"Boris Johnson threatens to walk away with no deal rather than sign up to EU rulesThe gulf between the UK and EU’s goals in trade talks has been laid bare as Boris Johnson threatened to walk away with no deal at the end of the year rather than sign up to EU rules on competition and state aid.Speaking in Greenwich, the prime minister made clear that his preference was for a Canada-style deal with no tariffs, but he said he would rather accept a loose “Australian-style” relationship with the EU that involved tariffs than accept alignment with any Brussels regulations or oversight by European courts.He delivered his vision in a metaphor-laden speech at the Old Royal Naval College, pledging to use the UK’s “newly recaptured powers” after Brexit to head “out into the world”. The prime minister declined to mention Brexit, saying it was now in the past and that the country needed to move on.Moments earlier in Brussels, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief trade negotiator, set out the EU’s negotiating goals, involving a contrasting vision in which the UK and EU maintain a level playing field.He reminded Johnson of the UK’s “very important” pledge that it would stay true to EU rules on subsidies and standards, as Brussels staked out its opening position for the negotiations ahead.He pointed to the political declaration agreed last year with Johnson, while admitting that alignment was a “red rag” to Westminster.Brussels is demanding that the UK “dynamically aligns” on state aid and competition regulations to prevent the British government from subsidising elements of the economy such as steel, aerospace or the car industry.The European court of justice would act as the final arbiter of EU law. The EU is also seeking “non-regression” on environmental and social standards and workers’ rights.“There can’t be possibly any surprise on the British side to hear that, if we are acting in good faith here,” Barnier told reporters at a press conference. “I say that because in the text of the political declaration … there are some very clear words there. A full chapter that talks about the description of the level playing field and the objective of having fair and open competition.“In that text, Boris Johnson and we … both say that we are keen to avoid any distortion of competition and any unfair competitive advantages. That is what we are talking about here. There is nothing surprising in that … I can tell you that he and his team paid attention to every word and comma in the text that commits us on both sides.”Johnson made the case that the UK should not abide by Brussels rules any more than the EU should have to follow Britain’s regulations after Brexit.“There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules,” Johnson said.“The choice is emphatically not deal or no deal. The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada’s – or more like Australia’s. In either case, I have no doubt that Britain will prosper. And of course our new relationship with our closest neighbours will range far beyond trade. We will seek a pragmatic agreement on security, protecting our citizens without trespassing on the autonomy of our respective legal systems.”Johnson also took a hard line on fishing rights, saying the UK was ready to strike an access agreement with the EU that would be negotiated annually and “ensures British fishing waters are first and foremost for British boats”. The prime minister refused to acknowledge that leaving the transition period at the end of 2020 on World Trade Organization terms was tantamount to leaving on no-deal terms.David Gauke, the former justice secretary who was expelled from the Conservative party by Johnson and subsequently lost his seat in December’s election, said an Australian-style relationship would effectively be a “managed no-deal”.He said the possibility remained “underpriced” and the government could be tempted to “rip the plaster off” by leaving without a deal at the end of the year, “and then you’ve still got three years to pull the economy round” before the next election.Gauke, who describes himself as “economically dry”, pointed to the irony of a Tory prime minister advocating increased state aid for struggling companies. “The Tories’ great fear of Jeremy Corbyn was that he was going to take the economy back to the 1970s. You start to worry that that might be where we’re going anyway,” he said.Mujtaba Rahman, of Eurasia Group, a consultancy, said state aid was likely to be a particular crunch point in the talks. He said EU leaders were conscious that Johnson’s majority relies partly on winning and retaining constituencies with manufacturing, steel and other industries.“That’s where I think they’re more concerned. These voters lean right on security and lean left on the economy,” he said. “You’re going to see a more liberal state aid regime.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections.

For a fortnight, the pretty face of the gentle game took a battering in Melbourne, bouncing from one public relations disaster to another, and the bruises will last.The image meltdown began with the reluctance of the Australian Open to acknowledge with sufficient speed and clarity what everyone in the city – everyone in the country and around the world – knew about the choking effects of bushfire smoke. It then moved on to the similar impact the twisted moral rectitude of Margaret Court had on everyone not born in the 19th century, most publicly Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe, who objected to the 77-year-old legend’s hardwired homophobia and almost forgotten apartheid apologia. Holy smoke, indeed.Presentation is everything. While the cheerleading television companies covering the first slam of the season for a worldwide audience of many millions could hardly ignore what their viewers saw through the yellowbrown haze on the screens, most dramatically the on-court coughing collapse of Dalila Jakupovic, it took the tournament days to satisfy the curiosity of the media and the inquiries of worried players and spectators about what constitutes safe air in Melbourne Park.The pollution eased Court got guarded semi-apologies from Navratilova and McEnroe, but she did not reciprocate. The tournament and TV pretended, risibly, that Navratilova and McEnroe had broken hitherto unknown “safety protocols” – not what they actually did, which was to embarrass Court. Navratilova and McEnroe put out statements, agreeing.But there was one exclamation mark left to put on the sentence of embarrassment. It arrived at the end of the ninth game in the second set of the men’s final on Sunday evening when Novak Djokovic had his Serena Williams moment. He was enraged, with minor justification, that two violations for slow serving had shredded the steel grip he normally has on his emotions. So, with all the assurance of an entitled champion, he tapped the foot of the chair umpire, Damien Dumusois, and, to borrow from Australian argot, “gave him a serve”.When he should have “let it go through to the ‘keeper”, Djokovic had “a nibble outside off” and exploded. “You made yourself famous in this match,” he said to the dignified Frenchman. “Great job. Especially in the second one. Great job. You made yourself famous. Well done man.”The damage was done. Again. Because he is playing tennis from Mars (albeit via Hades), Djokovic recovered to beat Dominic Thiem, cast in the Naomi Osaka role here (except, unlike the Japanese player in the 2018 Flushing Meadows final against Williams, the Austrian lost, and that matters in this tale). In the euphoria of Djokovic’s eighth Melbourne victory, the moment was briefly parked, to resurface only when the winner remembered his obligation to put a sheen on the event. Correctly again, he apologised for his crassness. Sort of. Trying to patch up the image thing with a smile, he said: “For touching his shoe? I mean, I didn’t know that’s completely forbidden. I thought it was a nice, really friendly touch.”It was not a good look, for himself and for the tournament that had just made him A$4.2m (£2.1m) richer. Because he is charming and intelligent, he reckoned he’d pulled it off. However, like the fire smoke, there was a lingering whiff of something being not quite right. The headlines were awful. Someone looked up the rules. He could be fined A$30,000 for that sort of thing – like Williams, who had to pay a little less in the end.So on Monday, when he should have been glorying in his victory, he apologised again. “Sometimes you do things that you’re not happy with and you go through different emotions. You go through ups and downs. Of course, I’m not happy that I touched the chair umpire. And I’m sorry if I offended him or anybody else.” Put to bed. Done. Move on. Image saved. Or maybe not.Court will regard her visit as a triumph, honoured on the 50th anniversary of her calendar slam, with her eponymous stadium still in place – despite Navratilova’s campaign to have it changed to Evonne Goolagong Arena.Court will be back, saying whatever she wants. So will Djokovic. Will Navratilova? Will McEnroe? They were backed into a corner to stop rocking the bloody boat, guys. Maybe they won’t bother to make the trip next time. It’s a long way to go to be humiliated when you know you’re right.The odds are Djokovic will win the men’s title again. At his best, nobody can touch him, except Rafa Nadal on clay if fit. Federer couldn’t beat him with two match points at Wimbledon last summer. Nor could he protect a 4-1 and 5-2 lead in the first set against Djokovic in the semi-finals.Djokovic, on 17 majors now, could add two of the remaining three slams in 2020. So, this time next year, if he won a ninth Australian Open, he could sit alongside Federer on 20 career majors – with Nadal, if the Spaniard wins in Roland Garros this summer. All three of the Big Three sharing 60 grand slam titles, equally and nervously, each wondering which of the other two will leave the party first. That’s some image.And it’s some party. For all the nonsense of the past fortnight, tennis continues to amaze. If only it would lighten up a little. If only it would say in public what it says behind closed doors, like Navratilova and McEnroe – and, probably, Djokovic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36466cc0262e86dd4eb9169d21140dff3e7d7eda/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57fd307b6560c201a4b1b6b2149f78c8","title":"jennifer lopez shakira super bowl half time show latino political","story":"Jennifer Lopez and Shakira’s half-time show featured not-so-subtle allusions to Trump’s immigration policies and Puerto RicoJennifer Lopez and Shakira wowed the crowd at Super Bowl LIV on Sunday, bringing their greatest hits to the National Football League’s half-time show in Miami.The 12-minute extravaganza was complete with fast-paced salsa dancing and Afro-Colombian footwork but it also included a not-so-subtle political message on the plight of Latinos in America.In an apparent reference to immigration enforcement under Donald Trump, the show featured a scene with children in illuminated pods that appeared to mimic cages.Last year, the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrants families at the border with Mexico created a public outcry as images of children in holding cells began circulating online.“Latinos are going through a difficult time in the US right now,” Shakira, a native of Barranquilla, Colombia, told reporters in the days leading up to the game. “I think it’s very important for us to convey a message of unity.”The NFL’s half-time show is a popular feature in a week of events surrounding the Super Bowl, which garners about 100 million TV viewers in the US alone. Miami, the host city this year, is majority Latino.Greeting the crowd with “Hola, Miami”, Shakira was joined by Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Bad Bunny before uniting with Lopez for hip-shaking and acrobatic routines.The NFL had attracted criticism for not including native Floridian talent in the lineup but the two Latina headliners met with praise. And their rebuke of growing anti-Latino sentiment received high marks online.Lopez is a Bronx-born child of Puerto Rican parents. The island of more than 3.2 million, a US territory, is still recovering from a category 5 hurricane in 2017 and more recently a series of powerful earthquakes.In a mash-up of her hit Let’s Get Loud with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, Lopez revealed a rectangular boa with the US flag on one side and the Puerto Rican flag on the other.The coat aimed to remind the audience that Puerto Ricans are Americans, too. Puerto Ricans, also known as “Boricuas”, relished the shout-out.The camera then panned to the illusion of children in cages as a motif that blended into an appearance of a choir led by Emme Maribel Muñiz, Lopez’s daughter with her ex-husband, the singer Marc Anthony.Not everyone was a fan of the political messaging.Some noted an inconsistency behind Lopez and Shakira appearing to criticize the Trump administration.

After steering the Kansas City Chiefs to a comeback win over the San Francisco 49ers in Sunday night’s Super Bowl, he had described the moment as “surreal”. Collecting his award as the game’s Most Valuable Player on Monday morning, he returned once again to that term.“In reality you never could imagine what this feels like,” he said. “It’s surreal to be a Super Bowl champion, to know all the hard work that you put in every single day has paid off. Being the champ with your brothers, you can never think of what that’s like.”The peculiarity of this moment can only have been heightened by a kiss from Minnie Mouse before he began. On the eve of Super Bowl LIV, a Mahomes tweet from 2013, when he was 17 years-old, had gone viral, in which he pondered what it would feel like “to be the quarterback who says ‘I’m going to Disney World’ after winning the Super Bowl”. He had found out on Sunday night, but now – thanks to a new sponsorship deal for this award, Disney World had come to him.Still, he would be reminded before the end of this press conference about the cold realities of the business he inhabits. Mahomes has one year remaining on his rookie contract in Kansas City, and was asked how big of a priority it would be to get a new deal done in the offseason.“To me that’s stuff that’s handled with other people,” said Mahomes. “Obviously I want to be in Kansas City for a long time. I also want to win a lot of games here. For me, it’s letting that stuff handle itself. I’m in a great organisation, I have a great team of guys and girls working for me. So it’s about trusting those people to find the best way to do it, in order to have the best time around me and about getting that done when the time’s right.”Already it is being speculated that Mahomes’s contract could be the first in the NFL to break the $200m threshold, although the Chiefs face a delicate balancing act as they seek to meet their star quarterback’s financial expectations whilst conforming to the league’s salary cap and also surrounding him with the talent he needs to keep delivering titles.The latter point is not lost on him, either. Asked how he could follow up on Sunday’s achievement, Mahomes answered simply: “Win another one.” He knows he cannot do it alone.“We’ve built a brotherhood with this team,” Mahomes said. “You can see it with the way we play and how we support each other. So obviously we want to keep as many people here, keep as many people with the Kansas City Chiefs, and keep this brotherhood going. For me, obviously we want to win a lot of football games, but I think more than anything I want to be around these guys every single day.”His coach feels likewise about working with such extraordinary talent. “It just kinda came natural to him,” said Reid. “He works on it, but there is a part that is just easy for him. He sees the field. You say ‘all quarterbacks can do that’, no they don’t. Not like he does. He comes off and can tell you, accurately, what he saw that play. There’s video evidence if you’re right or wrong every play.“This guy’s unbelievable. He can take it all in. He challenges you to give him more, his aptitude is ridiculous. As a coach you love that, able to feed him new plays, and he gobbles those things up, makes them look even better than they did on paper.”That is true even when Mahomes is not getting his hands on the ball. One of the more memorable plays of this year’s Super Bowl came in the first-half, with the Chiefs facing fourth-and-one at the 49ers’ five-yard line. After lining up in a conventional goalline package, the Chiefs changed formation and the ball was snapped directly to running back Damien Williams, who took the ball down to the one-yard line.Talking about the same play, Reid confirmed that the inspiration had come from a 1948 college game between Michigan and USC. “My brother’s high-school coach was actually in that game for USC, so I had a bit of tape,” he explained. “Went back through it and pulled that out. We actually have a whole package based on that. So you’ll have to wait for next year: there’s some more good stuff.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15a9c35790ec0a19779aa7b7953744f2b3aa4603/90_93_2418_1451/master/2418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c04ba36f35a0537f4e8a8f74a28e55c6","title":"super bowl liv the best pictures as the chiefs stun the 49ers","story":"Our favourite images from Hard Rock Stadium in Miami where the Chiefs came from behind in the fourth quarter to beat the San Francisco 49ers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c2c6e14d177effd8e7f6a1bd7e22af1e3ba0788/0_87_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7812f4319c8f173cbee188d2fb67ea7","title":"hamilton musical cinemas disney","story":"In what’s allegedly a record-breaking $75m deal, the Pulitzer prize-winning stage musical, with the original cast, will land at cinemas worldwide in 2021The hit Pulitzer prize-winning musical Hamilton will be in cinemas worldwide in 2021 after a deal with Disney reportedly worth $75m.The 160-minute film was shot in 2016, two weeks before the original cast left the Broadway show and is being described as a cinematic stage performance that will combine “the best elements of live theater and film”.

Gatiss will star as the ghost of Ebenezer Scrooge’s business partner, Jacob Marley, in his own version of Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. The play is to open at Nottingham Playhouse in October and then Alexandra Palace in London at the end of the year.Gatiss said that Dickens’s novella, which was first published in 1843, “has been absolutely my favourite story since I was, well, tiny. It’s an astonishingly powerful tale of life, love, loss and redemption and remains supremely relevant. But at its heart it is a ghost story and that will be at the core of my new version. A scary, thrilling, joyous adventure to get the blood piping on a freezing winter’s night. A Victorian phantasmagoria!”A Christmas Carol was adapted for BBC One last year, with Guy Pearce in the lead role, and remains a perennially popular festive production in theatres, too. Jack Thorne’s version has returned to the Old Vic for two consecutive years since its premiere in 2017 and also had a run on Broadway. Piers Torday’s radical reworking, Christmas Carol – A Fairy Tale, which focuses on Ebenezer Scrooge’s sister, Fan, was staged at Wilton’s Music Hall in London last year, while Tony Cownie’s An Edinburgh Christmas Carol, staged at the Royal Lyceum, brought the story back to the city where Dickens was believed to have first stumbled across a memorial to Ebenezer Scroggie, providing inspiration for his tale.Gatiss’s version will be directed by Adam Penford, Nottingham Playhouse’s artistic director, who collaborated with him in 2018 on The Madness of George III. The new show was announced on Monday, along with other Nottingham Playhouse productions including Choir Boy, written by the Oscar-winning Tarell Alvin McCraney (Moonlight), which will open in 2021.Opening alongside A Christmas Carol this October at the Playhouse will be a new drama about the Labour MP Ellen Wilkinson, who led the Jarrow march and introduced free milk in schools as education secretary.

But one other thing was unusual about the jam: it only existed on Google Maps.Simon Weckert’s artwork Google Maps Hacks involved the artist pulling a small red cart at walking pace down some of the main thoroughfares of Berlin. The 99 phones in the cart, all reporting their locations and movement back to Google’s servers, gave the search company the impression of a huge cluster of slow-moving traffic, which was duly reported on the company’s maps.“Through this activity, it is possible to turn a green street red, which has an impact in the physical world by navigating cars on another route to avoid being stuck in traffic,” Weckert wrote.In his statement, Weckert cited a journal article by the German anthropologist Moritz Ahlert: “Google’s map service has fundamentally changed our understanding of what a map is, how we interact with maps, their technological limitations, and how they look aesthetically.“What is the relationship between the art of enabling and techniques of supervision, control and regulation in Google’s maps? Do these maps function as dispositive nets that determine the behaviour, opinions and images of living beings, exercising power and controlling knowledge? Maps, which themselves are the product of a combination of states of knowledge and states of power, have an inscribed power dispositive.”One of Weckert’s virtual traffic jams ran directly past Google’s Berlin offices, as the artist’s video footage showed barely any cars on the street – though there were a number of bikes and electric scooters.A Google spokesperson said: “Whether via car or cart or camel, we love seeing creative uses of Google Maps as it helps us make maps work better over time.”The work, revealed just a few days before the 15th anniversary of Google Maps’ founding, is just the latest example of a prankster taking advantage of the “crowdsourced” nature of much of Google’s data collection. In 2015, the company had to shut off one feature, Map Maker, after a series of embarrassing vandalism incidents culminated in the creation of a virtual park, the shape of which appeared to resemble the company’s Android logo urinating on Apple’s trademark.The company was sued the same year for allegedly lifting parts of its database from a rival app, PhantomAlert, which had included digital “trap streets” in its database. Those points of interest, which did not exist in the real world, showed up in Waze, a mapping app Google bought in 2013, PhantomAlert claimed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c806a8508a51066ebdc1a32153b4c4d5ede13b9/0_0_2119_1271/master/2119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba38e560bdc93bd19c4e35624eadab0","title":"five ways to start enjoying your holiday before you even get there","story":"Holidays should be relaxing, but all too often they end up being incredibly stressful in the run-up. Travel writer Lizzie Pook shares her tips for starting your holiday as you mean to go onHave a planning partyIf there was ever an excuse for a party, a holiday is it, and there can be something quite ceremonial about plotting your annual escape from the drudgery of everyday life. So make an occasion of your holiday planning. Take care over it. Set some time aside, throw some snacks in the oven, round up your family, other half, group of friends, or pour yourself a glass of something fancy if you’re travelling solo, and actively brainstorm holiday activity ideas. If one of you fancies horse riding at sunset on a footprint-free beach – whack it on the list. Heard of a must-visit farm-to-table restaurant in that tiny French village you’re heading to? Get in touch with them see if you can make a reservation. You don’t have to plan everything to a tee (unless you’re a laminated itinerary kind of traveller, and that’s fine too), but making an occasion of plotting, and getting excited about your upcoming trip will make you value it (and the people you’re sharing it with) even more.Book through one providerIt can be tempting to take a scattergun approach to booking your holiday a train trip here, a hotel there. But booking through one provider not only makes the process less stressful and more streamlined, it also means that if you come up against any niggles along the way (such as last-minute cancellations or unforeseen delays), they are easily ironed out because one company is overseeing everything. With Brittany Ferries Holidays you can book it all – from ferry journeys to quaint rental gites – in one go, with sailings from Portsmouth, Poole and Plymouth to multiple ports on the picturesque west coast of Europe. It’s Abta-protected and offers everything from motorcycle tours and family camping holidays to disability-friendly trips and golfing breaks. So whether you’re off to Aquitaine or País Vasco, keep it together, your stress levels will thank you.Go slowWe’re talking slow travel here: trains, two feet and ferries. The slow travel movement is gaining (snail-paced) momentum right now, with many tour operators, travel experts and trend forecasters citing it as one of the biggest developments for 2020. And it’s not just better for the environment to sidestep carbon-heavy air travel and opt for a slow, satisfying glug of a journey instead. Not only do you gain a new appreciation for a landscape by walking or driving, but sailing to your destination by ferry means you can load up your car with all your essentials, instead of attempting to squeeze everything you need into a woefully tiny carry-on bag. So there’s far less packing-induced stress, and far more space for novelty pool inflatables. Win, win.Make a destination-based reading listThe buildup to a holiday can be almost as exciting as the holiday itself the so-close-you-can-almost-touch-it anticipation of shortbread-coloured beaches, peacock blue seas and the gentle flutter of the warm breeze on your skin. Get yourself firmly in the mood by reading books based on or set in your chosen destination. Heading to Spain? Try the off-kilter Hot Milk by Deborah Levy or Chris Stewart’s Driving Over Lemons. Pick up Circe by Madeline Miller if you’re planning a trip to Greece, or dip back into Louis de Bernières’ fantastically evocative Captain Corelli’s Mandolin to be transported straight to sun-scorched Kefalonia. And if a ferry trip to France is in the offing, ramp up the excitement by rereading Joanne Harris’ fantastically cosy Chocolat, or the wonderfully complex All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr.Get the right insuranceIt may not sound glamorous, but ensuring you’re covered against anything that might befall you on your holiday (and in the preceding days and weeks) will give you the peace of mind to really relax and enjoy the buildup. A European health insurance card doesn’t cover your belongings, travel delays or cancellations, so it’s crucial to sort insurance before you travel. While you’re sorting that out, don’t forget to organise your European vehicle breakdown cover at the same time too. So whether you need emergency medical assistance after an accident, or simply don’t fancy being stranded on the side of the road in a remote rural French village with nothing but chattering birds and the slow drone of bumblebees for company, then do your future holidaying self a favour sort your insurance before you go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8104590a3bacd49905447494648e16a8745c5663/0_115_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f3b6b1265f6d36477bc5c0d67e727e5","title":"support local businesses and six other ways to be a responsible tourist","story":"If you’d like to make sure your 2020 summer holiday has less of a negative impact on the planet, follow these seven simple tips ...More and more of us are faced with a dilemma: how do we explore the world without contributing to the destruction of the places and communities we’re visiting?The answer? Responsible tourism – a movement that encourages us to travel in a more conscious, sustainable way. From how you reach your destination to how you treat the people and environment once you arrive, there are dozens of ways to make your trip more mindful. And the good news is, being a responsible tourist comes with its perks, and can make for a much more meaningful and enjoyable trip.Here’s your rough guide to responsible tourism ...Skip the tourist hotspotsYou’ve been to Paris five times before and it’s teeming with tourists – so why not head to Nantes, set on the banks of the Loire, instead? Smaller, less well-known cities are often packed with just as much charm, history and culture, and are keen to welcome visitors. Barcelona is another famous city that’s suffering from overtourism – so much so that there have been protests by locals. So if you’re looking for a stylish Spanish getaway, head to Santander. The belle époque capital of verdant Cantabria is a real foodie hub, and a world away from other Spanish coastal spots.Support the local economyOne of the best ways to help the places you love is by supporting them financially. There are dozens of ways you can do this, from frequenting family-run shops and restaurants to using local tour guides and services. Another great way to support the local economy is to seek out independently owned places to stay. Brittany Ferries Holidays, for example, offers lots of locally run accommodation options – from boutique hotels and charming B\u0026ampBs to coastal campsites and self-catering villas.Leave no traceIt’s a message we hear again and again, but somehow when we are abroad it slips to the back of our minds. Whether it’s the temptation to collect shells from the beach, to pack a picnic filled with single-use plastic, or to seal a romantic moment by fixing a love lock on a bridge – it’s vital that you think about the effect your actions will have on that place once you’ve left. The best thing you can do for the landscapes you love is leave them exactly as you found them.Have a little respectMuch as you might want to take that arty shot of the little old lady buying her apples in the market, she may not appreciate becoming the star of your social media post. Just as you probably don’t like to be photographed going about your daily life, chances are neither do the people living in the places you visit. Maybe zoom out a bit and take a general shot or, if you want to snap a market display, buy a few things from the stallholder first. A little modesty when entering a place of worship goes a long way, as does a “good morning” as you pass someone in the street, if that’s what the locals do. Become part of the community and you’ll enjoy a much more authentic experience.Learn a bit of the local language None of us wants to be that tourist, so it’s worth swotting up on a few words of the local language before you depart. Often a simple “hola” or a “merci” will put a smile on someone’s face and show that you are at least trying. If your language skills take a nosee after that first introduction, all will be forgiven because you showed a little courtesy. Feeling ambitious? Attempt to learn a few simple phrases and test them out in shops and restaurants. Who knows, you might even end up making some memorable connections with locals.Eat local, eat seasonalThis is undoubtedly one of the most pleasurable ways to be a responsible tourist. After all, what could be better than dining on truffle-infused dishes in France in January, or the freshest of seafood paellas on the sunny Spanish coast? Make your food choices count don’t just hit the supermarket, shop at the local market to support farmers in the region, and dine in restaurants where they serve seasonal produce and the catch of the day fresh off the local fishermen’s boats. It keeps the local economy going, cuts down on food miles, and often involves ingredients that are exposed to far fewer chemicals and pesticides.Keep it greenEven the smallest things can have a positive impact on the environment. Take a reusable water bottle with you instead of buying endless plastic ones. Choose environmentally friendly sun cream, so you cause less damage when you swim in the sea. And if you’re looking to make a more significant difference, explore alternative ways of reaching your destination. Ferries, trains and even driving all result in fewer carbon emissions than travelling by plane, and can result in a far more exciting and memorable journey. And if you want to go even further, consider offsetting your carbon emissions once you return."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6133b0c61ec42c6831047a70046a5951cdb66278/0_126_1722_1033/master/1722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdf8a10383d178af37cb2d29144d3e2a","title":"the art of slow travel the journey is just as important as the destination","story":"Forget last-minute dashes to the airport, ticking off top 10 sights and desperately searching for that perfect Instagram snap – the future of travel is slowWhen was the last time you really slowed down? The kind of slow that involves sitting in a plaza and watching the world go by, heading out for a leisurely walk just for the joy of it, or simply choosing the slower mode of transport so you can enjoy the views along the way?Welcome to slow travel, the movement that goes back to what travel is all about – the journey, not the destination, the experience, not the social media post.Slow travel started as an offshoot of the slow food movement, which itself began in Rome in the 1980s as a protest against a McDonald’s opening up in Piazza di Spagna. What started as the indignation of food-loving Italians turned into a celebration of traditions and culture, of authenticity and building connections – ideas that were all wonderfully ahead of their time.In a world where we’re all too busy and too stressed, with too little time and too many emails, slow travel is like a deep breath of fresh air. It is our chance to step out of our lives and immerse ourselves in a different culture, to explore and soak up experiences.Slow travel is about enjoying those hundreds of perfect little moments that make up a trip a view transformed when the sun comes out from behind the clouds, the ideal spot found to watch a city come to life at dusk, that moment you connect with someone across the language ide.Forgo the planes tearing through the sky and high-speed trains turning every landscape into a blur, the journey is at the heart of the slow travel movement. Step on to a ferry, for example, and sail to your destination of choice. Gaze out at that wide expanse and try to remember the last time you saw such an uncluttered view, just you and the horizon.You can even make it an overnight trip – after all, what’s the rush? Is there any better way to disconnect than by reading a good book with a sea view, enjoying a meal then retreating to your cabin to be rocked to sleep by the sea?Back on dry ground, modes of slow travel range from your own two feet to two wheels. There is nothing like a hike or bike ride through pristine scenery to set the heart soaring. Head off the beaten track and you could find yourself in a village where nobody speaks your language, where you have to negotiate menus scrawled by hand and sip on the local table wine served up in hearty jugs. And it could well be the best meal you’ve ever tasted.You can slow travel through mountains and forests or along coastlines, reconnecting with nature – but slow travel in cities is just as rewarding. The tangled streets of old towns are perfect for getting lost and discovering unexpected little squares. The chances are, in one of these squares you’ll find a slice of original slow life taking place – old men sat on benches catching up on the day’s news, women in tiny corner cafes enjoying a drink and a snack.The car may not feel slow, but try to beat that sense of freedom when you drive off a ferry in your chosen destination and can simply put a pin in a map and head off to explore. Spend days wending your way through country lanes to visit towns and villages, perhaps the odd vineyard or castle. Stay in an old converted farmhouse here, a cosy family-run boutique hotel there.In slow travel there are no specific rules. The aim is simply to enjoy authentic experiences, to push pause on all the stresses and pressures of modern life and treasure those little moments.For you, slow travel could be spending more days in one place, really getting to the heart of it, or choosing to stay in locally run accommodation. It can mean dining on wonderful locally sourced produce, the conviviality of a shared experience, or simply leaving city life behind and reconnecting with nature.Whether you are literally travelling slowly – hopping on a ferry instead of taking a flight, for example – or simply taking on some of the slow travel ideas (there’s nothing slow about mountain biking, but that uplifting feeling of being surrounded by nature and breathing in crisp, fresh air certainly fits in with the movement’s ethos), slow travel is the antidote to modern life.So the next time you’re planning a trip, make it a slow one. Wander, explore and lose yourself. Savour those fleeting little moments of perfection. Give yourself the journey to truly unwind. Relax and press reset.That’s what the slow travel movement is all about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/391d1cf11265e88432f4740c46fb71d150a9ec79/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8257c68204aa1b45003c4736fa5072e","title":"iowa caucuses 2020 elections candidates","story":"The midwestern state is the first to vote in the presidential primary race. So what are caucuses, and how do they work? Here’s your guide to the nightThe Iowa caucuses take place on Monday 3 February, kicking off the long process of nominating a Democratic presidential candidate who will eventually take on Donald Trump in November’s US election.The primary race is made up of a series of contests called primaries and caucuses that take place in all 50 states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which the parties select their presidential nominee from the candidates who are running.The goal in these contests is for candidates is to amass support from voters that translates into a majority of delegates, whose job it is to nominate a presidential candidate at the party conventions in July and August.When it comes to choosing a presidential candidate, Iowa traditionally goes first. Though Iowa has relatively few delegates, it is highly influential because it gives Americans their first chance to see what support the candidates have, and a win could provide a vital boost in momentum, as it did for Barack Obama in 2008.Democratic and Republican caucuses will take place on Monday evening, but because Trump does not face any serious competition from his challengers for the nomination, all eyes will be on the Democratic contenders this year.Most states hold primary elections, which are run by the state, and resemble general elections, in which voters go to a polling place, mail in their ballots or otherwise vote remotely. But a handful of states hold caucuses, hours-long voting meetings run by the party. Republican caucuses are simpler, and Democratic caucuses are more complicated.It makes for a drawn out night, as results are tallied from more than 1,600 different locations across Iowa – all 55,000 square miles of it.Patience will be key. Iowans who are eligible to take part will have to be at their caucus venue (usually a school, church or community center) in their local precinct at 7pm CT (8pm ET) in most cases – a tough ask itself given the frigid Iowa winters.Once there, it’s not a matter of ticking a box and going home. They will spend up to two hours casting their preference for presidential candidate.As for when we can expect to know the winner: it’s hard to say. In 2016 the Democratic race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton was so close that the results were announced the next day (Clinton won by a razor-thin majority). On the Republican side, Ted Cruz beat Donald Trump, and was declared winner before midnight.In most other states, primary voting works similarly to voting in a regular election. Voters turn up at a polling station and cast their vote privately. They usually have all day to vote, and don’t have to tell anyone who they voted for. Not so in Iowa.It isn’t a secret ballot. In that venue, a representative for each candidate will be standing in a certain area of the room.Voters have to go and stand in the area where their candidate is represented. So Joe Biden supporters would be in one corner, Elizabeth Warren’s in another, and Bernie Sanders supporters in another. Everyone is tallied.Once the bartering for supporters is over, the votes are totted up, and state delegates are awarded to each candidate proportionately. That, in turn, determines how many national convention delegates each candidate receives.The candidate with the most state delegate equivalents “wins” Iowa.

Thanks for all the messages and wishes.” Spain’s defence ministry dispatched an F18 fighter jet to evaluate the damage done to the Boeing’s landing gear as it flew in circles near Madrid.Emergency vehicles approached the aircraft on the tarmac of Adolfo Suárez-Barajas airport soon after it landed at 7.13pm local time (1813 GMT).In a statement, Air Canada said the plane “experienced an engine issue shortly after takeoff”, as well as a ruptured tyre – one of 10 on the Boeing 767-300. It added that the aircraft “is designed to operate on one engine and our pilots are fully trained for this eventuality”.“Nonetheless, an emergency was declared in order to obtain landing priority,” the airline said.A spokesman for Enaire, Spain’s air navigation authority, said the plane’s landing gear did not fold up properly on takeoff, and that a piece of it may have damaged part of an engine.Spain’s El Mundo newspaper published audio on its website which it said featured the plane’s pilot explaining to passengers the need to return to Madrid, because a wheel had been damaged during takeoff.Madrid residents posted videos online showing a plane flying unusually low over the city’s centre and suburbs.It was the second incident of the day at Madrid’s international airport, the busiest in the country. Earlier on Monday, the airport closed for over an hour due to the reported sighting of drones in the vicinity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfcab4f66d2e867cd33df2add935e3cc47990509/0_16_2608_1565/master/2608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee39666b03b16b89a9bae8f10370aba5","title":"jacinda ardern faces maori wrath over inhumane treatment of families","story":"A damning report into child removals by Oranga Tamariki sets the stage for tough Waitangi visit for New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern will face the anger of Māori leaders when she visits Waitangi this week after a report branded her government “inhumane” over its removal of children from Indigenous families.“There’s been unprecedented breaches of human rights,” said Naida Glavish, the head of a Māori-led inquiry into the practices of New Zealand’s child services agency, Oranga Tamariki.The investigation, which began six months ago, is one of five being conducted into the organisation, sparked by a documentary in 2019 that depicted social workers’ repeated attempts to seize a Māori baby from its mother shortly after birth.The report details what families describe as racial profiling, widespread fear among Māori families that their children will be taken away, and abuses of power by social workers. It details incidents in which armed police, with dogs, were sent to seize babies from their families.It is the first for decades conducted by Māori into a system in which Māori are vastly over-represented.Glavish said the inquiry, which spoke to about 1,000 families, showed last year’s documentary about the attempt to take a child into custody was not an isolated case. It included claims that women’s babies were taken into custody over cleanliness of their homes, their past records even though they had changed their behaviour, and the gang affiliations of former partners.It also accused the agency of not allowing extended Māori families to care for children – an established cultural practice – when relatives thought that was the best option.“For us here there is no way that we are actually going to allow it to continue,” Glavish said. “We’ve reached a stage where enough is enough.”That meant challenging Ardern on her pledge to do better by Māori, and her urging of Māori leaders to keep track of her progress, that she made in a 2018 speech at Waitangi marae.“She did make a statement here ... that she expects us to hold her to account and that’s exactly what’s happening now,” said Glavish.Waitangi Day commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, intended to be a document of partnership between Māori leaders and the British crown when the country was colonised. But breaches of the treaty by successive governments and inconsistencies in translation have caused conflict.Glavish added that five Māori leaders would meet Ardern and other ministers to discuss the issue next week. Along with other Māori leaders and groups, she urged the prime minister to dismantle Oranga Tamariki in its entirety and allow Māori communities to develop their own solutions to care for children.That goal has always been at odds with the views of Ardern and her government, who believe there will always be cases where a state child services agency is necessary. The prime minister told TVNZ on Monday that she accepted there was more work to do on the agency but that progress had been made.“We have put a huge boost into the support for the organisation so that they can start doing things differently,” she said, adding that Oranga Tamariki was not perfect.Oranga Tamariki would “now take time to work through the report,” said Grainne Moss, the agency’s chief executive, in a statement.She added: “While all New Zealanders want to see fewer children in care, Oranga Tamariki has an absolute obligation to protect children at risk.”The agency was created in 2017 as part of an overhaul of the care and protection system, which had come under fire for its record with children and families."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155310.1580314670!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"wifi woes i m in a nightmare situation with sky","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFile photo of a worker erecting a Sky TV poster in the UK.

Sky phoned on January 14th confirming the installation would take place the following day. The engineers arrived at 2pm on January 15th.Her husband called Sky the next day and was on the phone for over an hour. “Sky said they had never heard of an issue like this before and that the subcontractors should have completed the job. We are now in stuck in a conflict situation between Sky and the third party they subcontracted the job to. We have completed the relevant forms and are following Sky’s complaints process however no one from Sky is contacting us. Sky have said per their records we have high speed broadband and our land line is working. We have phoned Sky several times, we have been assured supervisorsengineers will contact us however to date they have not.”She says the broadband speed is now less than 1 MB per second and the modem is in the garage 25ft away and they no longer have a landline. “My husband works from home and he uses conference calls etc, so his work is hugely impacted . . . If you can help is any way to resolve this nightmare situation we would be hugely grateful.”We got in touch with Sky. To be fair to the company, the case does sound hideously complicated – even more complex than our reader’s initial communication may suggest and there were all sorts of moving parts involving more than one company as well as other elements.“This particular case was a complex one in so far as the connection point the customer wanted to route to was not in their home but was instead in their garage, 25ft away from the premises,” a Sky spokeswoman said. “In this instance, the engineers who attended the site to install the fibre to the home did not follow the correct protocol which resulted in a less than satisfactory customer experience.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The Green Party leader, Eamon Ryan has said any future government should look at all four options for the Cork-Limerick motorway and if savings are to be made by choosing a shorter route, they should be invested in public transport.Mr Ryan said that it made sense to look at all four options including three which incorporate the existing M8 which goes via Mitchelstown rather than automatically assuming a route via Mallow was the best solution.Cork County Council has strongly backed the western option which would involve construction of a motorway around Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville but Mr Ryan was more circumspect during a visit to Cork.The  revealed last week that the original estimate for the cost of the Mallow-Charleville Route of €850-€900 million was from 2010 and that a more recent estimate would put the cost at €1.2 billion.But Cork city based Green Party Cllr Oliver Moran said he believed utilising the existing M8 as far as Mitchelstown and then bringing a route north to link up with the Limerick-Waterford Road near Limerick would cost just 50per cent of that.Mr Ryan said the next government should look at all options but if it did choose a route via Mitchelstown, then the savings made on money allocated for the M20 should be ringfenced to improve public transport in Cork and Limerick.Speaking in Cork where he held a press briefing with the party’s five Cork general election candidates, Mr Ryan said such savings could be invested in advancing a light rail system for Cork and improving cycle lane facilities.“I think the best option will probably be a connection to the M8 but I wouldn’t presuppose the outcome and if that option is the better outcome and saves money, then I believe that money should be invested in public transport.”“Yes we need to improve Cork- Limerick and make sure towns like Charleville and Buttevant thrive as we do that but does it have to be a massive motorway coming into Blackpool where there are huge other transport difficulties?“Could we use other options to ert the traffic away from Cork and not make the mistakes made in Dublin where it’s all about motorways approaching the city and you don’t have the internal public transport options – it doesn’t work.” Cllr Moran, who is running for the Green Party in Cork North Central, said that the Greens fully recognised that the N20 is inadequate and dangerous in places and requires major upgrades including a bypass of Charleville.“Given these problems including the need for a widening of the road, it is understandable that many commuters from Mallow and surrounding parts of north Cork would want a motorway there,” he saidBut he accused Fine Gael of misleading the public into thinking that a motorway along the N20 is “shovel ready”, when they know a new route selection process is underway and are considering different options.“Fine Gael are allowing the public to believe a plan that the Taoiseach rejected in 2011, when he was Minister for Transport, is the sole plan right now – it’s cynical and unfair to the people who rely on this road to name it the ‘M20’.”Speaking at a Fine Gael rally in Ballincollig on Friday night, Mr Varadkar committed the party to upgrading the N20 to a motorway to help improve connectivity between Cork and Limerick as a counterbalance to Dublin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4160324.1580757042!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 rt%C3%A9 to invite mcdonald to leaders tv debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald looks set to be included in the final televised leaders’ debate. Photograph: CollinsSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was “pleased to accept” the invitation to Tuesday night’s RTE leaders’ debate after the broadcaster reversed its position. RTÉ had previously said its approach to leaders’ debates was based on empirical data on previous vote shares, but indicated that it was “open to evaluate representations by political parties”.Sinn Féin and the Labour Party made fresh bids for inclusion on Sunday, and the RTÉ steering committee, which oversees election coverage met on Monday morning to discuss the issue. Sinn Féin has polled strongly in all opinion polls since the campaign began, reaching joint first place with Fianna Fáil in a Red C poll in the Sunday Business Post.Sinn Féin director of elections Pearse Doherty on Monday welcomed the decision by RTÉ, confirming Ms McDonald would accept the invitation. “That being said, this should not have come down to a last minute decision on the part of RTÉ.“Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil wanted this election to be about them, but this election was never about two parties with no real policy differences, who have effectively been in government together for the last four years. Neither of them represent change. “This election is about the Irish people and our future.....Sinn Féin are the real voice of change in this election,” he said. Both Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin have said they have no difficulty with Ms McDonald being admitted to the debate.While Ms McDonald has declined to say that she will be a candidate for Taoiseach when the new Dáil meets, her party is not running enough candidates to make her the largest party in a new coalition. However, the momentum achieved by Sinn Féin in the campaign so far meant that the pressure on RTÉ to reverse its position was intense. Speaking on the campaign trail in Dublin Mid-West on Monday, Ms McDonald said RTÉ was wrong in its initial decision to exclude her from the televised debate. “They are the national broadcaster, they have a duty to present an informed, balanced debate,” she said in Clondalkin. “The idea of having the two men who were in Government together for the last five years debating each other on their shared record is farcical,” she added.Five other partiesOn Monday evening RTÉ confirmed it’s decision to invite the Sinn Féin leader to Tuesday night’s TV debate. In addition, it said it had also decided to invite the leaders of five other parties to a debate on Prime Time on Thursday night on RTÉ One.“In reaching its decision, RTÉ had strongly noted the BAI’s rule 27 governing general election coverage which states: ‘Elections are dynamic events and broadcasters should give active consideration to their approach to coverage over the duration of a campaign and amend this approach if they consider it necessary and appropriate so as to ensure fairness, objectivity and impartiality. Broadcasters are encouraged to seek out the widest range of opinions on the issues raised during any given election’,” it said in a statement.“RTÉ is very mindful it has a duty to the public to reflect events as they unfold. During the course of the campaign and over recent days RTÉ has taken into consideration the notable change in the dynamic of the campaign on the ground, and representation and statements by political parties. The dynamic has also been consistently reflected in all opinion polls since the campaign commenced. “We now consider it necessary to amend our original approach, respond to the changes in the campaign, and continue to put the audience first in the making of Tuesday night’s programme,” it added.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4160664.1580761604!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coalition government takes power in kosovo to end four month impasse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Leader of the Self-determination (Vetevendosje) party Albin Kurti: His government is likely to face strong EU and US pressure to lift  tariffs and facilitate swift resumption of negotiations with Serbia. Photograph: Valdrin XhemajKosovo’s parliament has approved a new government four months after elections, ending a political impasse that paralysed domestic reforms and left the future of western-backed talks with Serbia in limbo.Sixty-six deputies in the 120-seat parliament voted in favour of a cabinet led by long-time opposition leader Albin Kurti, and dominated by his Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) party and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK).The left-leaning Vetevendosje won 29 seats in the October 6th elections, just one more than the centre-right LDK, in a result that those parties said showed voters’ desire for reform and their frustration with successive governments that were dominated by veterans of Kosovo’s 1998-1999 war with Belgrade.After months of wrangling over cabinet posts, Vetevendosje and the LDK signed a coalition deal on Sunday and secured support from several parties representing ethnic minorities, which will give the government a slim majority.‘New chapter’The two main parties will each run six ministries and members of the minority parties will take over the remaining three ministries. Five ministers will be women, more than in any previous Kosovo government.“Today is a new chapter for the Republic of Kosovo, for the life of the Kosovar people, as well as for my own political activities,” the Prishtina Insight news outlet quoted Mr Kurti as saying before Monday’s parliamentary session.“It has been 23 years that I have been in opposition, now I have finally been given the chance, and the responsibility, to serve the people of Kosovo as never before.”Both main ruling parties say they want to cut red tape and corruption to boost investment and employment in Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008 after nine years of post-war administration by the United Nations. Russian support More than 110 countries, including Ireland, have recognised Kosovo’s independence. Serbia, backed by its major ally Russia, refuses to accept its sovereignty, however, and Belgrade retains strong influence in largely Serb-inhabited northern Kosovo.The EU has told Belgrade and Pristina that they must establish normal relations to have any hope of joining the bloc, but talks broke down in November 2018 when Kosovo imposed 100 per cent tariffs on imports from Serbia in response to its lobbying against the mostly ethnic Albanian state’s independence.Mr Kurti’s government is likely to face strong EU and US pressure to lift the tariffs and facilitate the swift resumption of negotiations with Serbia.The two main coalition parties made clear, however, that they would not support any final agreement that involved an exchange of territory between Kosovo and Serbia or any alteration of their current borders.German budget carrier Eurowings announced plans last month to relaunch passenger flights between Pristina and Belgrade, but analysts say they are unlikely to start until the tariffs are dropped."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit sparks housing boom capital estate agents reporting highest","story":"Brexit has prompted a housing boom in the capital, experts claim, after estate agents reported their highest rate of buyer interest in 15 years.Experts are reporting “unprecedented” levels of interest, with industry professionals forced to “stagger” their clients and extend their waiting lists. This comes following the general election in December last year, and ahead of Britain leaving the European Union last month. Experts are tentatively reporting that, finally, they believe that the commercial property downturn is being reversed. Knight Frank, the UK’s leading independent real estate company, reported that the number of new prospective buyers registering with the company in London rising to its highest weekly total in more than 15 years. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit was previously blamed for having a brutal impact on the commercial property market’s slowdown in the last few years. However the current post-election and post-Brexit spike in interest is being reported across the board.Jo Eccles, buying agent and founder of SP Property Group, which specialises in acquiring and managing luxury properties in central London, added that the company has seen its highest activity levels in the 14 years since she founded it.“We’re coming from historically very low transaction levels,” she said, “but absolutely we have been so busy with buying clients and we have been signing up two new buying clients a week. “This company has been going 14 years and we have never seen those activity levels.

The caucuses will render the first verdict on who among dozens of candidates is best positioned to take on President Donald Trump, whom Democratic voters are desperate to beat this fall.It is a moment thick with promise for a Democratic Party that has seized major gains since Trump won the White House in 2016. But instead of optimism, a cloud of uncertainty and deepening intraparty resentment hangs over Monday\u0027s election, which, after a multi-year buildup, will finally begin to reveal who and what Democrats stand for in this tumultuous era.If anybody tells you they know who\u0027s going to win, either they\u0027ve got a whisper from God or they\u0027re loony, because nobody knows, said Deidre DeJear, the former state chair for Kamala Harris and the first black woman to win a statewide primary in Iowa.As Democrats prepared for their caucuses in Iowa a Republican politician in Montana claimed the US Constitution allows for socialists to be jailed or shot.Rodney Garcia, a state representative, said at a public event that he believes that is what the Constitution means. He later told the Billings Gazette that socialists were enemies of the free state.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez describes herself as a socialistAnthony Johnstone, a law professor at the University of Montana, told The Washington Post : Nothing in the Constitution of the United States authorises the government to punish socialists or anyone else on the basis of their political beliefs.Our US editor Ben Riley-Smith has this on the undecideds:For those who are professionally contracted to follow the Democratic primaries it can be head-scratching that some voters still haven\u0027t picked a candidate. Most of the hopefuls have been running for at least a year formally, and many more months than that informally. Some have spent more than 60 days in Iowa alone. But dig into the polls and they suggest up to half of likely Iowa caucus-goers are still not fully locked in to an inidual candidate. A poll released this morning suggested just 51 per cent are absolutely sure who they are going to back.Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren squaring off after the last Democrat debateThat rings true having spent a few days on the ground talking to people who are turning out to campaign events. A lot of them are still weighing up the choice. And sometimes, it\u0027s not between two people who the national media naturally bunch together. Douglas Fraser, a 63-year-old who turned out on Sunday to see Elizabeth Warren, told me he was split between her and Tom Steyer. On the surface that sounds strange - the woman promising to take on billionaires and a billionaire. But he liked that they were both speaking about wealth inequality. Another voter at the event, John Davis, 73, was picking between Ms Warren and Amy Klobuchar, a moderate senator pitching herself against the left-wingers. He thought Bernie Sanders was too old. All of which is a long way of saying things look really fluid. Whatever the polls say, any four of the top candidates have a chance of winning tonight. Joe Biden\u0027s campaign team is setting expectations low for the Iowa caucuses, The Hill reported.While some campaign aides were unsure how the results would turn out hours before the caucuses would begin, they expressed some apprehension about the outcome. Joe Biden, 77, on the campaign trail in Iowa on Jan 13The problem, some Biden allies say, is that expectations for most of the candidates besides Sanders are also low, potentially setting up another moderate candidate, such as Buttigieg or Klobuchar to outperform and leave Iowa with a burst of momentum.“If Amy or Pete does better than expected and is getting a ton of buzz going into New Hampshire, that’s really bad for Biden,” said one Democrat who has raised money for Biden.“The longer there are more moderate candidates fighting over table scraps while Bernie gains strength, the more narrow the path gets for him going forward.”This 22-year-old Bernie Sanders volunteer flew across America to knock doors in Iowa.It\u0027s a sign of how close this contest is (see 18:11)...Nick Allen met a Republican who was persuaded to caucus for Joe Biden tonight.He changed sides after talking to Mr Biden about the issue of abortion.The voter said Mr Biden indicated there was room for compromise. Here is the voter, Steve Ephraim, being persuaded by Mr Biden.Donald Trump mocked leading Democratic presidential hopefuls for their size, lies and socialist-leanings as Iowa voted on who they want to take on the US president. In an interview with Fox News ahead of voting day Mr Trump gave a string of dismissive remarks about the politicians competing to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Donald Trump\u0026#39s interview with Sean Hannity, on Sunday eveningMr Trump called Bernie Sanders, the left-wing Vermont senator, a “communist” and said he was “crazy”, adding that the Democratic establishment is trying to stop him winning. The president took aim at Elizabeth Warren, another left-leaning senator and leading contender, saying: “Everything is a fairy tale. This woman can\u0027t tell the truth.”He also made a personal dig at Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who is 5ft 8in, calling him “Mini Mike” and joking he “wants a box for the debates to stand on”. Mr Bloomberg’s spokeswoman hit back at the president, saying: “He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity, and his spray-on tan.” The barbs suggest whichever Democrats wins the nomination the 2020 race is likely to be as heated and combative as 2016, when Mr Trump repeatedly called his opponent “crooked”. Iowa became the first state to vote in the Democratic nomination race, a year after many presidential candidates launched their campaigns. Snow and rain stayed away from the state, fuelling speculation there could be a record turnout as fired-up Democrats picked who they thought was best placed to defeat Mr Trump. An eve of election poll put Mr Sanders, the 78-year-old democratic socialist, in the lead by seven points before voting began. Joe Biden, the former US vice president, was polling in second. There is just a week to go before the second state to vote, New Hampshire, holds its primaries, giving candidates who underperformed in Iowa a chance to bounce back. After that comes votes in Nevada, then South Carolina. More than a dozen states then vote at the start of March on a critical day in the race dubbed ‘Super Tuesday’. An eventual nominee will be crowned at the Democratic convention in July, ready to take on Mr Trump at the presidential election on November 3. Closing arguments in President Donald Trump\u0027s impeachment trial are unfolding on Monday as much for history as any effort to sway votes, one final chance to influence public opinion and set the record ahead of his expected acquittal in the Republican-led Senate.The House Democratic prosecutors drew on history, the Founding Fathers and common sense to urge senators - and Americans - to see that Trump\u0027s actions are not isolated but part of a pattern of behaviour that, left unchecked, will allow him to cheat\u0027 in the 2020 election.A vote on Trump\u0026#39s impeachment will be held on WednesdayWhat messages does that send?  asked Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. He implored senators to realise that without a vote to convict, the Senate will allow the president\u0027s misconduct to stand.Senators acknowledge the House Democratic managers have essentially proven their case, that Trump abused power and obstructed Congress, by leveraging U.S. military aid to push Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden to thwart the 2020 election.But key Republicans have decided the president\u0027s actions toward Ukraine do not rise to the level of impeachable offense that warrant the dramatic political upheaval of conviction and removal from office.His acquittal in Wednesday\u0027s vote is all but assured.Nick Allen in Des Moines writes: In Des Moines there\u0027s snow on the ground but it\u0027s relatively clear overhead.

Johnson thanks Trump in the ad.Buttigieg says it\u0027s one of the handful of things the Republican president has done that he agrees with.But the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor said Monday it doesn\u0027t change the incredible cruel and isive racial rhetoric that comes out of this White House.Buttigieg tells Fox News Channel that\u0027s one of the many reasons he\u0027s been meeting Democratic and Republican voters who tell him they struggle to look their children in the eye and explain to them how this is the president of the United States.Buttigieg is among the top four candidates, along with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.This, from the Pew Center, is helpful as to how many states caucus.Not as many as used to. This year, besides Iowa, only two other states (Nevada and Wyoming) and four U.S. territories will pick their Democratic convention delegates through caucuses, 11 fewer states than in 2016.In 2018, the national Democratic Party adopted a package of changes to its nominating process, including a rule encouraging state parties to use government-run primaries whenever possible.Caucuses have been on the decline for a long time.Campaign signs stand outside Wells Fargo Arena ahead of the Iowa Democratic Party Liberty \u0026amp Justice Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, in NovemberOn the Democratic side in 1972, 33 states and territories used them to pick convention delegates, and, as late as 1984, 32 still did.By 2016, however, only 14 states and four territories were still using them.(As a side note, the Republican and Democratic parties in each state can, and often have, choose different methods to select their convention delegates, with one party holding a primary and the other a caucus. We’ve focused on the Democratic side in this post because that’s where the active nomination battle is.)Iowa holds caucuses, making it different to many other states which hold normal elections. There are 1,678 caucus sites at churches, community centres, schools, libraries, and even people\u0027s homes.At 7pm on Monday  local people will gather at each site to hear short arguments on behalf of the candidates. Supporters then ide into groups.Elizabeth Warren campaigning in Iowa They can speak to each other, and try to persuade others to change their minds. Occasionally, someone will try to buy a neighbour\u0027s support with a bottle of wine.Then a count is taken. If any candidate has backing from less than 15 per cent of the people in the room they are considered unviable. Their supporters can exercise a second preference and join a different group. Then a final count is taken.Ben Riley-Smith, our US editor, has this on Elizabeth Warren’s last appearance of the weekendOn the final day of full campaigning before the vote Elizabeth Warren, the left-wing senator from Massachusetts, gave a town hall at Iowa State University in Ames. More than 300 people turned up. Ms Warren, unlike some of her rivals, takes a lot of questions during here stops on the trail. On display were the characteristics that sent her soaring in the polls mid-last year - detailed analysis to policy problems, a certain folksiness and a consistent call for “big, structural change”. She later slipped back but remains a real contender. Elizabeth Warren campaigning in Iowa on January 12Ms Warren leant into the issue of whether a woman can beat Donald Trump - something she has clashed with fellow left-winger Bernie Sanders about - pointing to the success female candidates had in the 2018 mid-term elections. She also took appeared to take a swipe at Mike Bloomberg, the mega-rich former New York major and rival candidate, while joking about how billionaires had reacted to her wealth tax proposal. “Some have gone on TV and cried,” she said. “It was so sad. Others have run for president. They thought it would cost less than a wealth tax”.She finished with a rousing call to arms, declaring: “This moment in history will not come our way again.”Whether Iowans agree she is best placed to tackle the moment remains to be seen. She is polling fourth going into the caucuses. Simon Conway,  a host for WHO News Radio in Des Moines, Iowa explained the significance of the state in a recent press briefing. “\u0027Why Iowa?\u0027 is one of the most common things that we ever hear, and it’s a very interesting question, because we’re a small state, we’re right in the middle of the country and... we’re told, well, it’s not representative of the states, of the country as it is now.“But actually, if you look at the results going back really quite some time, Iowa is within a point usually of the national result. So it’s fascinating that we are, in fact, representative.Barack Obama surprised many by winning Iowa in 2008Mr Conway goes on to point out that if it wasn’t for the fact that Iowa was first in the nation, “you might never have heard of President Barack Obama.“He was able to do this even though he didn’t have huge amounts of money, which if you took away the first-in-the-nation caucus state, Iowa, if you took away the first-in-the-nation primary state, New Hampshire, then we would start picking our presidential candidates based on who had the most advertising money and could advertise in the heavily populated states like New York and California.The 2016 race between three candidates - Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u0027Malley - seems like a distant age.Today there are 11 candidates in the race - down from 25 a few months ago.It\u0027s a very tight race.Bernie Sanders supporters in Iowa on February 2Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have slight leads over the rest of the pack.Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobouchar came next.The only other candidates Monmouth found to have more than 1 percent support were entrepreneurs Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang, with 4 and 3 per cent support, respectively.Good morning, and welcome to our coverage of the Iowa caucus.As the first state to vote, Iowa holds a special place in the 2020 US election. The candidate who wins Iowa, and even a non-winner who performs better than expected, enjoys a burst of momentum as they head to the next states to vote.Barack Obama\u0027s unexpected win in Iowa against Hillary Clinton in 2008 is widely credited with giving him the national attention which propelled him to win the Democratic nomination. Winning Iowa does not guarantee a candidate will become the party\u0027s nominee, however. Ted Cruz won the Republican caucus in Iowa in 2016, but ultimately lost the nomination to Donald Trump.Norwegian concrete firm sues state after clumsy attempt to recruit its employees to spy on RussiaComment: Dangerous terrorists like Sudesh Amman should stay behind bars  Thirteen children killed in stampede at Kenyan primary school \u0026#39Saudi has become North Korea under MBS\u0026#39, says satirist suing kingdom for cyber attackPrivate patients at risk of another rogue surgeons like Ian PatersonCoronavirus:  hand washing is more important than face masks - but don\u0026#39t touch the taps afterwards  Emily Maitlis \u0026#39forever looking over her shoulder\u0026#39 because of stalker, says judge as he is jailed for 12th breach of restraining order\u0026#39Distracted\u0026#39 Network Rail staff working from home caused rail near-miss in south LondonComment: The Tories must match their tough rhetoric on policing with action, or risk the public wrath\tBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson says UK must become champion of global free trade Scores of koalas found dead or injured after farm clearance in AustraliaStreatham terror attack: Government to introduce emergency legislation to remove automatic early release for terroristsMacron\u0026#39s pension reform reaches parliament as opposition tables \u0026#39absurd\u0026#39 22,000 amendments\u0026#39Timid\u0026#39 Scottish Tories failing to provide \u0026#39effective opposition\u0026#39 to SNP, says leadership candidate Iowa caucuses 2020: History backs winner to clinch presidential nominationCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world Sudesh Amman: the man who shared his chilling doctrine of hate with family and friends since his teenage yearsBabies and children tear gassed during refugee protest on Greek island of LesbosHow the Streatham attack unfolded: \u0026#39The lady was just walking down the street - he stabbed her in the back\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/31/13/zero-waste.jpg","title":"zero waste household goals tips ways climate change environment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027We don’t bother with supermarkets, corner shops or service stations anymore because everything is wrapped in plastic\u0027I’m not sure this is a great idea.\u0026nbspNot because I don’t believe in dramatically changing how we live to try to save where we live, but because my family and I have already done so.We have been a zero waste household since 2018. Our ultimate aim is to produce no waste in our everyday life, whether we’re at home, at work or school, socialising, on holiday or getting from A to B.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesFive key steps I\u0027m taking to reduce my plastic use this yearFrom food packaging to clothes, cleaning products to kids’ toys, we try our damnedest not to produce any waste that wouldn’t compost. That means we don’t use single-use plastic, for example. We try not to buy any new plastic at all in fact, including synthetic material. There isn’t a single bin in our house.\u0026nbspAt first, with two very young children and both of us working full time, the shift felt extreme. Sometimes it still does.\u0026nbspWe don’t bother with supermarkets, corner shops or service stations anymore because everything is wrapped in plastic. We buy our food in jars, metal containers and bags we take with us to shops where we weigh out what we need. Overnight we stopped buying any pre-prepared food and most takeaways, everything is cooked from absolute scratch.\u0026nbspIn the bathroom, we switched to soap from shower gels and bottled shampoo, our toothbrushes are bamboo, my son wears reusable nappies (a revelation as it turned out) and we make our own cleaning products (easier and more effective than I expected).If we buy things for our home, they are secondhand and made from natural materials if at all possible, including clothes, furniture, electrical appliances if we can’t fix what we have or borrow something, DIY materials like paint, you name it.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

We now do it a better way, I believe, for my family’s health, my children’s future and the local, national and global environment they will still be calling home long after I’m food for worms.\u0026nbspTaking matters into our own hands has been empowering to the point of intoxicating. It has helped curb a fair bit of eco-anxiety, we’ve lost a few pounds and, contrary to popular belief, it has already saved us a small fortune.\u0026nbspUpping the ante on our waste has also refocused our minds on other damaging aspects of our modern life, so we don’t fly anymore, our diet is increasingly plant-based and our car is electric. We’re trying to reduce the amount of water we use and take care of what we put down the drain, that kind of thing.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s normal, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be because it’s normal. We’ve got over the hurdles of our first zero waste Christmas, holiday, birthday party. This is how it is going to be, how we believe it needs to be for the rest of our lives.\u0026nbspOur families and friends, work colleagues and schoolmates have stopped assuming this is a phase, or just ignoring our wishes, and have started asking for support as they cut down waste themselves.\u0026nbspWhy eating with the seasons in January is harder than it soundsAnd yet at the back of my head I’ve got doubts. I can’t shake the idea that I’m kidding myself over what we’re really achieving with all this.\u0026nbspIt’s not that we’re too insignificant to make a difference. We get that thrown at us a lot, mostly from people who somehow think our lifestyle decisions are all about judging them and get defensive.I obviously don’t agree anyway. I have two tiny children and I refuse to believe that I can’t help protect their future. My usual response is “It’s only one plastic bag, said 7 billion people”. I think I stole it off Instagram or something.\u0026nbspNo, my nagging doubt is about what truths I might find if I dig a bit deeper.\u0026nbspTake something simple, like recycling. Most of the nation does it in some way. Ours is almost exclusively metal and glass, and there’s a lot less of it than there used to be.\u0026nbspBut I know the recycling process requires transport, energy to transform the material and more energy to reintroduce the renewed item back into the consuming system. Should we be “zero recycling” too?And, if you start thinking about it, what about the environmental impact of the restaurants we go? The places we stay away from home? How our friends make the food we eat when we visit? If I really want to see this through, should I be asking our local café what they have had to throw in the bin to make me that sandwich? If they have, should I stop using it? Should I stop supporting my local economy, adding to the risk that it closes and people who live in my little town have to start driving miles for a cuppa and a cake?\u0026nbspWhat about all the non-physical consuming I do? What’s the carbon impact of the email I’ll send my editor about this blog post?If I pursue zero waste to its limits, will I ultimately find that there are almost no services I can use? Will a truly zero waste life effectively mean dropping out of society? And if so, which compromise is one too far? Where do I draw the line between looking after the environment and looking after my family and myself? How much effort am I willing to make and at what cost?Because these last two are the questions I suspect we’re all asking about our environmental responsibilities right now, here’s my 2020 pledge. I’m going to up my game, I’m going to go for true zero waste to see what that really means.I’ll review the decisions that have got our family to where we are now, do the research on our real life impact and then take it to extremes to find out what is possible for your average household.\u0026nbspSo, as I say, I’m not sure this is a great idea.\u0026nbspBut I have to try.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble.

His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in.

The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union.

I’m not sure European leaders, let alone leaders here in the UK would actually welcome that kind of language.”Renewed calls for Scottish independence follow UK’s departure from EUIn response to accusations there was no plan for Scotland, Mr Raab added: “I don’t think that’s right, we want to make sure, with the levelling-up agenda, with the opportunities of Brexit right across the board, that Scotland’s got the great opportunity to take advantage of all those benefits.“At the same time, we obviously expect the SNP to deliver on its commitment to honour the outcome of the independence referendum and not keep coming back and asking for a second one.“But a lot of this is a distraction from the standards in schools, the high level of taxes, that actually the job of the Scottish government in discharging its responsibility to the Scottish people ought to be focused on.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Expect independence to surgeThousands march to demand Scottish independenceOn Friday, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, who has been demanding Boris Johnson grant the Scottish government the powers to hold a second independence referendum, said Brexit was a “profound moment of sadness” for many who did not vote to Leave in Scotland.The comments from Mr Tusk come after a YouGov poll which showed 51 per cent support for independence – a majority for the first time in five years.However, a majority of Scots surveyed also said they would not like to see another vote on the issue in 2020 or 2021, but most said they would like to see another referendum within the next five years.Also speaking on the issue, Labour’s shadow chancellor,\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell, told the BBC: “I desperately don’t want them to, I want a United Kingdom. I will always argue for that UK and I’m hoping they don’t go along that path.“But I just say to Boris Johnson and his colleagues, do not do things that will threaten the unity of our country – and the language that we’ve heard even in the last 24 hours is isive, rather than holding the country together.“And if he can’t secure a good deal, it will again encourage others therefore in Scotland to go their own way and I think it would be completely counterproductive for the Scottish people.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Luckily her new job allowed her to cut her hours and work from home to make the situation work for her.But she hopes the DWP will shake-up the system for it to help others in future get back into work.A DWP spokesperson said: We cannot comment on an ongoing case."},{"url":null,"title":"juncker love you and leave eu","story":"BY the time you read these lines, we’ll be gone . . . well, almost.At pm tonight, Britain leaves the structures of your beloved European Union.Finally, we bid you so long, farewell, au revoir, auf Wiedersehen, adieu.As the pubs kick out from John o’ Groats to Lands’ End, we will no longer be part of your frustrating bureaucracy which, over the years, has given us such delights as the directive on straight bananas, the butter mountains and the wine lake.We will no longer be taking part in your mind-numbing pan-European discussions over milk quotas or steel subsidies. At last we will take back control of trade, human rights and migration.You will forgive us I hope, Mr Juncker, a moment of celebration as we raise a glass to an independent and prosperous future. It has been a hard path to get to this point — one you, of all people, know.But as we drink and make merry you — and everyone  from Amsterdam to Zakynthos — should know this.We are not going to wake up tomorrow morning feeling any less European.Ireland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands will still be our neighbours.We will still be eating Brie and driving Volkswagens, and we will still be sending brown saucein the other direction.Indeed, we might now feel more European.No longer will we have to worry about those fabled traffic jams which were going to block the M. We won’t be bothered about the planes not taking off or shelves emptying of fresh food.We will be able to get on with sharing and enjoying European civilisation.We will still be watching European football matches and knocking back German beer.

Brexit parties were held from Cornwall to Cumbria.Parliament Square was awash with Union Jacks as Nigel Farage had a beano that he had been planning for  years, chucking a metaphorical milkshake over everyone who ever dissed him.But this was not VE Day.Where Brexit was celebrated, the mood was one of patriotic pride rather than euphoria unbound.This was a very British departure — respectful, self-effacing and anxious not to cause offence.We refrained from sticking up two fingers. We were scrupulously polite.The UK started le outside the EU with no Big Ben ringing the chimes of freedom, no firework display setting the post-Brexit sky ablaze, no laser show on the white clfs of Dover.The big moment came at pm rather than midnight — the UK, now as always, a little out of step with our continental cousins in Brussels — so it did not even feel like New Year’s Eve.By midnight — already am in sleepy old Brussels — the party was winding down.As we left the EU, Downing Street lit up with red, white and blue lasers and an image of Big Ben, complete with a recording of the bongs.But the door of  Downing Street stayed firmly shut as the Prime Minister hosted a private party for staff.For all the nation knew, Boris could have been having an early night with Carrie and Dilyn the dog.Downing Street was as deserted as the Marie Celeste.Here was the strangest thing about Friday night — the total absence of Boris Johnson.The PM had recorded a speech full of optimistic talk about making Brexit a “storming success” and bringing the nation back together.But the BBC and ITV both refused to broadcast the speech, as Downing Street aides had refused to let them film it.Soyou wanted to see what the British Prime Minister said about this truly momentous moment in British history, you could not have seen it on our state broadcaster’s channels. UNBELIEVABLE.The BBC news studio was bathed in Brussels blue, asin mourning — so censoring Boris felt small-minded, ­churlish and petty beyond belief.I strongly suspect that ­refusing to broadcast Boris’s big Brexit-night speech will turn out to be the beginning of the end for the licence fee.If the BBC cannot look like a state broadcaster on a night of historic national importance, then it never will.But we didn’t need the Beeb to tell us that this was history happening before our eyes.The biggest mandate for anything in British history had FINALLY been honoured. Democracy had triumphed.After more than  years inside the European federalist experiment, the British people were masters of their own destiny once more. And while the national mood on Friday night was respectful for the feelings of the losers, perhaps that was because there is no need for ­triumphalism when you know you have won.The clock struck pm and Leavers and Remainers were all suddenly extinct.All those eye-swivelling nutjobs threatening to shove a Brexit p coin up their pious rectums in protest no longer seemed like a threat to ­democracy.They seemed worthy of pity.But after all the toxic ­isions of the past four years, the wounds will not heal quickly.The most vicious insult thrown at those of us who dared to vote to leave the EU was that we would all soon be dead. And so it is a bitter irony to reflect that Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine, John Major, Lord Adonis, Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and all the rest will never live long enough to drag us back into the European Union.At long last, Brexit’s uncivil war is done.And why Because the roots of British democracy run deep.Once we had voted to leave, it was ultimately unthinkable that we would ever remain — despite the fervent wishes of almost the entire British establishment, from the House of Lords and House of Commons to the civil service, the BBC and big business.Once the people had spoken, in the end they had to be obeyed.No parliamentary paralysis could ever stop Brexit. No clever lawyers could thwart it forever.That historic moment on Friday night felt it had an historic inevitability about it.British democracy could not be denied. How did the arrogant, out-of-touch establishment ever imagine they could overrule the largest vote for anything in our history So au revoir, monsieur, and adios, senor and bye-bye, mein liebe herr. Except — we are not leaving Europe, are we We are only leaving the European Union — that unloved, corrupt, expansionist empire.And the British people have nothing but love in their souls for Europe.Here’s the great Brexit irony. The British are probably the most pro-European nation on the continent. We revere European culture, drink their wine, holiday at their beaches, cities and moun-tains, eat their fruit, vegetables and cheese and buy their cars.But the British have always been a lousy fit in the EU.We do not like having leaders who we cannot kick out.We do not enjoy unelected old geezers in foreign cities telling us who can and can’t come into our country.We — one of the oldest democracies in the world, a country that has not been invaded for , years — truly do not need anyone  to make our laws or to tell us what justice looks like.The EU just lost its second-largest contributor while the largest contributor — Germany — teeters on the edge of recession.We should try to be understandingthey sound bitter.Our stormy relationship with the EU has lasted all my adult le.The first time I ever voted was in the  referendum, when I girded my flared jeans and enthusiastically voted “Yes to Europe”.But like my nation, over the course of the decades I fell out of love with the EU.Like my nation, I began to feel that I had been lied to about what the project really meant.Like my nation — and around .million of my countrymen in  — the thought of “ever greater union” made my skin crawl. For I believed with all my heart and soul that my great nation’s identity is worth preserving.Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, sneers that the UK must “come to terms with the fact that it is now a small country”.Leo’s line is that the UK is now an isolated little rain-lashed rock, cowering timidly off the coast of the mighty European Union empire.But it doesn’t feel like we are a small nation today.It feels like we are a global nation once again, open for business with the world.It feels like we are the world’s sixth-largest economy, a cultural superpower, a warrior nation with a nuclear deterrent and the best armed forces in the world, the oldest parliamentary democracy on the planet and the longest-reigning monarch in history.All of that, plus the new added ingredient of post-Brexit va-va-voom.And in a Europe blighted by fragile coalitions and leaders with feet of blancmange, the UK boasts a popular Prime Minister presiding over the strongest, most stable government in Europe.British democracy has a far longer history than the European Union.If we were a small nation, then we would never have had the guts to leave the EU.If we were a small nation, then after the EU referendum of , we would have done what all those other EU countries did when they came up with a referendum result that Brussels didn’t like.We would have voted again, until Michel Barnier put down his cane.But the UK was always dferent.Unlike so many of our neighbours, we have not known the terror of fascism and communism, we have never experienced the jackboots of an invading army on our land, we have never seen our country chopped up by cruel foreign conquerors.We are a small nation in size but, through the centuries, we have always proved too big to bully.And what now The extremist voices — on both sides of the Brexit debate — will fade away because extremism is never the British way.Even with a year of transition and haggling about trade ahead, Brexit feels like it is slipping into the history books.The EU referendum in the summer of  seems long ago now.But as I recall, all we ever wanted was for our country to be a self-governing, sovereign nation once more and to restore the freedoms bought with the sacrice of the generations who came before us.Big Ben was silent on Friday night, but did you hear the church bells ring in all the faraway towns That is the sound of a country that just got its mojo back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last year from April to December, we received more than , boxes.“They’ve all got to be opened and,there’s an email address, acknowledged.“We try to be organised but you are talking about cardboard boxes with pants in them, all labelled, on the floor.”The charity started out small in  with Maria asking friends and family to donate towards a target of , pants for charities in Africa.She was overwhelmed when she received , pairs and delivered them to orphanages, hospitals and refugee camps in Kenya.She said: “These kids do not have underwear, they’re wearing rags and sometimes plastic bags.”Maria registered the charity in  and was working with friends from her home in Livingston, West Lothian.She said: “I managed it really well until  when we went viral on Facebook. We went from  likes to , in a week.”Maria recruited more volunteers and left her insurance job to go part-time at the charity.She said: “Imagine you didn’t have any underwear – how would you go about your day “Our work means girls get to go to school and stay in school.CARING husband and we Terry and Annette Marsh were so disappointed by the lack of sports facilities for ­disabled youngsters in their area, they decided to set up a club just for a few months.That was more than  years ago and the Hampshire Harriers has since gone on to help hundreds of young people, disabled and able-bodied, to participate in sports on equal terms.Wheelchair basketball is the club’s forte and many of its members have gone on to gain confidence and better health while several have excelled to ­represent Great Britain.New arrivals to the club, however, often find their heavy wheelchairs make it dficult to compete, so Terry and Annette visit schools regularly with the old-style chairs to show able-bodied pupils just how hard it is for their disabled classmates to get around.Modern, lightweight made-to-measure sports wheelchairs are expensive, ranging from £, to £,-plus, but the donation of £, from The Sun Readers’ Fund will buy new wheelchairs for four more disabled youngsters.Retired labourer Terry, , who is still the head coach and treasurer for the Portsmouth-based club, said: “I was shocked when I heard we had been chosen to receive the money from Sun readers. It’s wonderful and will make a real dference.”He added: “We’ve got one young lad who is typical. His father said he used to sit at home all day just playing on his computer because he felt he could not get involved in sport because of his ­disability. He is now a changed person.“He has become more sociable, more independent and goes to watch sport as well as playing it with us.“It’s so nice to see the change in youngsters when they are given the chance to get involved.”FOUNDED in honour of seven-year-old Madison Allan – who died from cancer on Boxing Day  – Maddi’s Butterflies offers other children fighting the disease a chance to have a holiday in a specially adapted caravan in Blackpool.And a £, donation from The Sun has now guaranteed it can continue for another three years.Maddi’s Butterflies was set up in  by Madison’s parents Samantha, , and Mark, , from Darwen, Lancs, who also have ten-year-old daughter, Scarlett.In its first year, they raised enough money to buy a six-berth caravan situated in Marton Mere, Blackpool, where up to  families a year can now enjoy a break from hospitals and cancer treatment.Samantha, who runs Maddis Butterflies - which also has a busy charity shop - full-time alongside two employees, said: “Maddi was diagnosed with neuro- blastoma, a rare childhood cancer of the nerve tissue, in July , aged only ten months old. It changed our lives forever.“Maddi hated hospitals and despite how poorly she was, she was determined to come home for Christmas in her final year.She managed to open her main present, an iPad, and although she was too ill to eat, she sat with the whole family for Christmas dinner, taking it all in.“She had fought so hard, stayed so positive and suffered so much.When she left us the next day it was ­gentle and peaceful.”A precious family break at a caravan in Blackpool during Maddi’s final months inspired Samantha to offer the same opportunity to others.She says: “The ­caravan is somewhere families can relax and spend happy time together.“Travelling abroad is often impossible, but this is accessible to everyone.”But the charity struggled with the costs and came near to having to close down.Samantha says: “When I heard we were going to receive The Sun money, I cried with relief.“Maddi was our hero, and her strength and determination in le continues through ­us helping other children like her.”THEY are a hardy bunch in the ­Scarborough And Ryedale Mountain Rescue Team.

They are providing mutual support for one another in prison so theyre not being reformed.”But he says terrorists like Amman are acting alone, with no backing from formal organisations.Its a dferent type of terrorism from what we might have seen in earlier decades where its much more centrally directed.

One retired police detective said yesterday it takes a team of  officers to carry out round-the-clock surveillance on an inidual target.Meanwhile, London Bridge attacker Usman Khan was a convicted terrorist who was on probation after being freed halfway through his sentence under automatic early release rules.In the wake of the November attack, the Government proposed a raft of changes, including scrapping early release for offenders classed as dangerous, giving those convicted of serious crimes like preparing acts of terrorism a minimum of  years behind bars, and forcing dangerous terrorists who receive extended determinate sentences to serve the whole time in prison.Under the Counter TerrorismBill, offenders not classed as dangerous would also be expected to serve two thirds of their sentences – rather than just half – while the number of counter-terrorism probation officers would be doubled.Today, PM Boris Johnson made a fresh vow to crack down on the early release of terrorist prisoners following the Streatham kne rampage – although it’s not clear how any changes would be applied to existing cases.We are bringing forward legislation to stop the system of automatic early release. The dficulty is how to apply retrospectively to the cohort of people who currently qualy, said Mr Johnson.It is time to take action to ensure, irrespective of the law we are bringing in, people in the current stream dont qualy automatically for early release.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Government we have had some good discussions, but they will not be easy either.He added: The alternative would make me feel very uncomfortable.A pilot is still ongoing in Harrogate which is putting people from the old system to the new one - and ministers are mulling how to roll it out nationwide.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

Markets never respond well to that.”“Global growth right now is projected to be greater than three percent.If this continues, and maybe evenit only continues for another month, you could knock that down below three.”As part of an attempt to stimulate the economy and prevent a downward spiral, Chinas central bank, The Peoples Bank of China, has unexpectedly lowered interest rates.It also injected  billion yuaninto the economy on Monday to ensure levels of liquidity in the banking system.The coronavirus outbreak comes amid an ongoing trade war between China and the United States, sparked after President Trump began imposing tarfs and other trade barriers in a bid to counter his countrys growing trade deficit."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher bans pokemon cards leicester","story":"Rebecca Dulieu, head of St Marys Fields Primary School in Rowley Fields, Leicester, said pupils need to learn how to play the popular card game properly.In her statement, issued to parents this week, she said that arguments had erupted in class between game-obsessed youngsters.Pokemon is a card game, based on a Japanese video game franchise, where players collect dferent creatures which have ious powers.Mrs Dulieu said: “Children will no longer be able to bring Pokemon cards to school, due to the disruption and arguments it is causing in lessons and during break playtimes.However, she issued a further statement informing parents that the ban would no longer be permanent.Mrs Dulieu said that a lunchtime club would be set up in the future to teach the children how to play the game properly.She said: Children were bringing the cards into class from break time which was distracting them from learning.They should be focusing on their learning which is I think what parents will want them to do too.The children have been spoken to today and the majority understand, we dont want the them to be upset but I think we have taken steps to make sure that they are happy.She said the school has had no complaints from parents about the ban.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The journalists then walked out of No , in the latest escalation of Mr Johnsonaposs tensions with the media. Shadow Culture Secretary Tracy Brabin MP said: “Press freedom is a cornerstone of our democracy and journalists must be able to hold the government to account.It is concerning that Boris Johnson seems to be resorting to tactics imported from Donald Trump to hide from scrutiny. “The future trade agreement with the European Union is an issue of great public importance and interest. Those gaining access to such important information should not be cherry picked by Number .”  Labour MP Wes Streeting branded the move totally unacceptable and Trumpian and suggested it had been enabled by frequent attacks on mainstream media from across the political spectrum, in an apparent reference to Jeremy Corbyn. Fellow Labour MP David Lammy said it was deeply sinister and was straight out of Donald Trumpaposs playbook, adding: Our democracy depends on a robust and independent media being free to hold the government to account. Pro-Brexit journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer, who spoke at the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square on Friday night, said: It is totally unacceptable for No to try to pick and choose which journalists can attend lobby briefings.All credit to the integrity and professionalism of those journalists who refused to accept the briefing when others were excluded. This stuff matters in a democracy. Angela Rayner, favourite to win the Labour deputy leadership contest, tweeted: This is very poor stuff, behaving like Trumpaposs press and media cronies, utter disgrace! No wonder so many news organisations walked out, quite right too. A No  insider said they had arranged a small briefing for selected journalists, adding: Uninvited Journalists barged in and demanded to be part of it. It was made clear - only those invited could stay. They chose to leave”. However, one lobby source pointed out it was impossible to barge in to No  which is protected by several layers of security, including iron gates and armed police.

Violet Cocking still wears clothes designed to fit an  month old - and is only a few inches taller than her four-month-old sister, Ada. Mum Charlotte Cocking, , was concerned about her size from birth, but says medics were unable to find a cause for two and a half years. But after months of turmoil, a genetic test revealed Violet from St. Ives, Cornwall, had microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type  - a genetic condition inherited from both parents. Charlotte and her husband Robert, , unknowingly carried the dwarfism gene which meant Violent inherited the same defective gene from both. Charlotte, who is a bartender said: People assume Violet is a toddler so when I tell them her real age, they look at me with a very confused expression. Violet has settled well into reception but requires extra support - she has a really good friend called Willow who looks out for her. She is ft in, a foot taller than Violet, which is a pretty average height for a four-year-old but their height doesnapost stop them from being the best of friends. Violet was born at  weeks yet she looked smaller than ever and weighed lb oz. Charlotte added: She was kept in NICU as she was unable to feed and could only stomach ml of milk a day - the equivalent to a double shot in barmaid terms. As the months passed, she barely grew, and I became very concerned that she was wearing newborn clothing at six-months-old. She wasnapost much bigger than a pint glass at three-months old.  Even now she wears specially made shoes which are a size two and a half for babies. But periodically she was fine, we had genetic and blood tests with the NHS but the results were never abnormal - but I knew something was wrong. I researched the living hell out of her characteristics - she had curved fingers and puffy feet along with a really small head. Dwarfism always popped up in a search, but I assumed I was being daft until we had another test that involved a saliva swab from me, Rob and Violet, when she was two and a half. We were over the moon to finally a diagnosis that revealed she has a rare form of an already rare form of dwarfism. The couple discovered a charity called aposWalking with the Giantsapos who have a specialist genetic team that has diagnosed five other children with Violets condition in the UK.  There was a  per cent chance Violet would be a carrier like each of her parents and a  per cent chance to not have the condition. Violet is still currently reaching all her milestones and despite her development being delayed, she did learn how to walk seven months ago. Charlotte said: I canapost help but feel like I wasted the first year of Violetaposs le obsessing with what is wrong with her. I feel guilty, but I was desperate to get an answer which is when I came across the charity Facebook group. I canapost thank them enough for their support and it is nice to be able to speak to other parents who have children with a rare form of dwarfism. We donapost know what to expect for the future, but she is very lucky as other children with this condition are known to be severely disabled.  Violet isnapost a typical child, but she is smart and funny - she is mentally three-years-old. Her speech is behind and can be hard for others to understand and she can only walk a short distance in places where she is familiar with.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMillions of hard-pressed parents will be cheering after the school ­unorm rip-off began heading for the bin. Following a Sunday People campaign, Labour MP Mike Amesbury will introduce a bill this week which is likely to become law by spring. Schools will be told they can specy basic items such as trousers and shirts - but not styles. This means parents can buy cheaper supermarket kit instead of branded gear from a single suppliers that cost an average £ a year for secondary schools and £ for primaries. Dad Howard Callaway, , and we Karen, , dread the cost of fitting out their children with compulsory branded kit. Mum-of-three Karen, a teaching assistant in Hull, said: “We can’t afford three branded sets so this news is fantastic.”  Mr Amesbury said: “Head ­teachers will be required to draw up a totally ­inclusive unorms policy. This issue has been ­brilliantly highlighted by the Sunday People.” Nearly one in six families say school unorm costs are to blame for them having to cut back on food and other basic essentials, compared with one in seven in . One parent told the Poverty Commission: “The cost of school unorms is like having to afford two Christmases. You start shopping at the beginning of the summer holiday, so you can pace yourself over the six weeks. “To do that you have to take money out of the food budget, or less on the electric. But this stuff is essential, so you have to afford it.”  Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner wrote to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson asking him to honour the pledge the Tories made four years ago. They promised to bring in statutory guidance in a bid to end the practice of forcing parents to buy unorms from one expensive supplier. But it never happened. The new law would force the Government to follow the example of Wales, where school heads can specy basic items, such as trousers and shirts, but not styles – so parents can shop around. Private Members Bills give backbench MPs priority time in Parliament to introduce their own laws.  A draw takes place and twenty MPs are picked at random who are allowed to decide on a subject of their choice. The higher up on the list the MP comes the more chance he or she will get Parliamentary time to see the Bill through all its stages.

But “Ginny” would neverhome from that fateful paper round in August . And her body would never found. Her parents John and Sheila had separated, and Ginny, , lived with her dad John, his partner Violet, and her daughter Tania. On that fateful day, Violet was at work. Tania was going on holiday to Cornwall with her dad, and at .pm, John drove her to Exeter to catch her coach, leaving Ginny at home. At just after pm, she set off on her blue Kalkhoff bike and rode through Aylesebeare, Devon, out of the village and onto the main road. She collected a bundle of papers from outside the White Horse Inn, and began her round. At .pm, Ginny travelled along Withen Lane. At a small bridge she bumped into her friends, Margaret and Tracey. The girls walked back towards Aylesbeare together, Ginny pushing her bike up a small slope. She hopped back on and cycled ahead. Minutes later, the girls found her bike in the road, the papers spilled from the basket. Her dad John remembered: “Genette’s friends came up to say that they couldn’t find her anywhere and they were pushing her bicycle. I went back with them to the lane... After a very short time Violet said, ‘John, I think we better call the police’.” Within hours, officers were combing the area and the RAF search and rescue helicopter was buzzing overhead. But after months of searching, the investigation eventually wound down. In , John Black was convicted of the murder and rape of three young girls, which led to Devon and Cornwall Police questioning him about Ginny. They were convinced they had their man but in , the CPS said there was insufficient evidence.

Elaine Ainslieaposs distinctive triangular child’s purse, containing eight coins and a Girl Guides promise badge, was found by a metal detecting enthusiast. Alistair Milne, , made the discovery in the grounds of Trefoil House near Hermiston, Edinburgh which was once used as a Girl Guides camp.Alistair was determined to reunite the distinctive purse with its original owner and posted a picture on Facebook to try to track the person down.Elaine, , instantly recognised the handmade purse, as her mother had stitched it for her and given a matching one to her sister, Sandra, . But she was baffled as to how it ended up in the grounds of Trefoil House, which was also the site of Trefoil School -  which was dedicated to “the all round development of children with special needs” - and where her brother, Ian, spent time due to being in a wheelchair. Elaine, from Loanhead, Midlothian, was not a Guide herself, but her sister was and may have spent time camping at Trefoil. She said theof the long-lost purse sparked a ‘rollercoaster’ of emotions, when she collected it from Alistair and his pal Eddie Hughes, , at the site where it was found. It was handmade by her mother who spent time in Bangour Village Hospital near Dechmont, West Lothian due to a le-threatening accident. Whilst recovering in hospital, she made two purses: the off-white one which was Elaine’s and a pale green one which was her sister’s.  Elaine said: “It took me back about  years straight away and then of course that brought a rollercoaster of emotions and brought memories back I had completely forgotten. “I was reliving it all, it felt really good. “First I saw it I thought ‘how nice’, and then I saw the picture of the purse and just got a blast from the past. “All I could think was ‘where are you  I want you back’. “My mother made it when she was very ill, so it’s quite special. “It was triangle shaped with the stud and it was the same on the other side so when you handed it to people who didn’t know both sides of the purse opened, the money flew out everywhere, so to two wee girls it was a scream.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harrys naughty prank queen","story":"NewsPrince Harrys naughty prank on Queen after school and was only one who could fool grannyPrinces William and Harry used to join their granny the Queen for tea on Sunday afternoons during their time studying at Eton College in WindsorShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video prince-harry-arrives-canada-start-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news prince-harrys-naughty-prank-queen-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The Duke and his big brother Prince William used to visit the Monarch at her Windsor Castle home for tea when they were at school just around the corner at Eton. While the older of the Wales brothers would chat to his nan, Harry had other ideas and used to play a cheeky prank on her. According to former royal butler Paul Burrell, Harry was the only one would could get away with tricking her. Speaking to OK! magazine, Paul, who last spoke to the Monarch in , said: I know the Queen very well and I know she’s very fond of Harry. As William would sit and have tea with her after school, Harry would come and put plastic flies in the sugar bowl! It was hilarious. Harry was the only one who could trick his granny. And that wasnapost the only time he managed to pull a cheeky prank on his nan - and his mum Princess Diana played a key role in some of his other naughty schemes.  According to Paul, Diana would spend hours searching for the perfect stocking fillers for them each Christmas - and one year got her younger son something he absolutely loved. Speaking to the Mirror, he said: Sheaposd spend hours looking for jokey things for their stockings. One year, Harry got fake dog poo. According to Mr Burrell, he was planning to place it somewhere for his nan to see.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA woman who died after taking a cocktail of drugs had an illicit substance known by the street name aposflakkaapos in her system. Andrea Horvathova, , died after taking numerous substances including Alpha PVP, better known as aposflakkaapos, aposcrystalapos, aposgravelapos, or aposbath saltsapos. The drug has been linked to violent attacks in America. But an inquest heard how traces were found in Andreaaposs body after she died in Plymouth, Devon. The coroner was told that Andreaaposs heart and liver had been damaged after she took what was described as a cocktail of illegal drugs at a party in Plymouth, Devon. Experts concluded that the combination of drugs she consumed would have very likely resulted in a heart attack. And the death has prompted Devon and Cornwall Police to issue a warning to the public who said users often now have no idea about the strength of the drug. Andrea was found unconscious in the early hours of March , , after she collapsed and died in hospital three days later. The inquest heard that Andrea had already take a number of drugs during the evening but at some stage she was offered an unidentied pill by a man which she consumed. Her use of the drug was revealed in a toxicology report alongside traces of amphetamine, Ecstasy and cocaine. Alpha PvP first appeared in the early s and was patented in  as a nervous system stimulant, and became illegal in . It is described as a dangerous drug but the US Drugs Enforcement Agency and can be eaten, snorted, injected, or vaporised. They state that effects include paranoia and hallucinations that may lead to violent aggression and self-injury. In  police in Florida, USA reported an outbreak of extremely bizarre behaviour by people after using a drug dubbed aposFlakkaapos there.  One infamous incident saw claims a man named Rudy Eugene was high on aposflakkaapos when he chewed off another manaposs face during an attack. This incident was described as a cannibal attack and Eugene was widely dubbed the Miami Zombie in news reports around the globe that drew links between the drug and his behaviour. However toxicology results were inconclusive following the attack, and authorities were unable to conclusively connect his attack to aposflakka,apos as the drug was not found in his system. After it was made illegal, savvy drug manufacturers managed to skirt legislation by slightly changing the make-up of the drug and flakka spread throughout the US. But drug organisations fear its use is growing in the UK - with  reported cases of flakka use in the UK in . A drug expert for Devon and Cornwall Police said that the drug had been encountered in the area back in . They said their notes at the time referenced it as a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act and was part of the cathinone group of drugs, which included mephadrone. The drug expert said: People donapost know the strength of the drugs they are taking.  The internet market, which is where people are buying illegal drugs, has increased and as a result the drugs quality, strength and purity has increased and the effects are unpredictable. Fortunately we donapost see a lot of it, but Alpha-PVP is one we have seen in the past and has certainly been in Plymouth before. However, it has probably fallen under the cathinone category in our reports rather than its specic name. However, itaposs not something we have seen on a weekly basis - maybe once or twice a year per area.  In this case, as with many others, the risky behaviour is from poly-drug use and the dangerous effect a combination of drugs has on a body. Itaposs really, really sad when someone loses their le like this. Ruth Harrell, Director of Public Health in Plymouth, said: “Almost all UK drug deaths are, like this case, attributed to apospoly-drugapos use, where drugs that are commonly known to be dangerous are used in combination with alcohol and other drugs.

Doctors and nurses dressed in full hazmat gear and goggles helped deliver the healthy .lb boy on February  -  days after Wuhan, China, was first put on lockdown. Footage from Wuhan Union Hospital, one of the facilities on the front line of the viral outbreak in Central China’s Hubei Province, shows Dr Song Bo holding the newborn boy. The hospital’s isolation unit is the designated national location for pregnant patients diagnosed with or suspected of having the Wuhan coronavirus. Dr Song, who is pictured wearing goggles and a full decontamination suit, said: “The patient successfully gave birth to a ,-grammeboy. “The child is healthy and everyone is very happy. He’s been sent to Wuhan Children’s Hospital for further tests. “As a father-of-two myself, it’s been tough being on the front line day and night, but we’re all so excited to see this new le. “I believe we will win the fight against this disease.” Medics such as Dr Song have been sent from numerous other provinces to assist with the influx of people at Wuhan Union Hospital. The now mum-of-two, named only as Ms Gong, was transferred to the hospital from China’s north-eastern province of Heilongjiang on st January. She was placed under the care of Dr Song, who is with the department of infectious diseases at the Fourth Hospital of Harbin Medical University in Heilongjiang. The new mum has been in isolation as a suspected carrier of the deadly pneumonia-like disease, while her husband remains in quarantine after having previously been diagnosed with the virus.

He weighed almost  stone and by the time he was  was barely able to walk without help. Arya, from Indonesia, was too huge to use the family bathroom and instead had to wash in an outdoor pond. His diet of instant noodles, deep-fried chicken and fizzy drinks had seen him pile on the pounds almost as soon as he started eating. Arya weighed as much as six average boys his age and his condition became so extreme that he eventually had to be schooled at home because he could no longer make it into classes.His parents say they tried to encourage their morbidly obese son to eat more healthily but admit they couldnapost help but spoil him His father, Ade Somantri, said: Since Arya was five-years-old and already getting big I can say, aposyes I spoiled him. If he wanted to eat or drink sweet food and drinks we just gave it,he wanted instant noodles, we just cooked it. Arya ate his way through five huge meals a day, so large they had to be served on two plates. Despite begging his parents for sweet food, Arya was desperate to loose weight. And then is started having a serious impact on his health, with him unable to walk for more than five minutes before getting so out of breath he couldnapost carry on. Doctors had tried to persuade Aryaaposs parents to give permission for him to have a gastric sleeve fitted so he could shed the pounds. Initially they were reluctant to allow their son to have the surgery but when they realised they were putting his le at risk, agreed. The operation, carried out in Indonesiaaposs capital, Jakarta, took five hours and just a month later Arya had already lost a massive five stone. However, Arya, who was just  when he had the surgery found the adjustment to what he could eat incredibly hard. Arya was very annoyed and upset because he loved eating but after the gastric bypass surgery,he eats a lot, he vomits. From two massive plates every meal-time, Arya was now full after eating just seven spoonfuls of food. Slowly, he started to get used to his new diet and now loves to eat grilled fish, vegetables, soup and fruit. Arya lost enough weight to be able to manage the walk to school and was delighted to be back playing with his friends. He can also now play the sport he loves, but was unable to take part in for so long. Arya said: I am happier now because I can play football, hang out with friends, play around, go to the river. Back then I couldnapost do anything or go anywhere, I couldnapost play football, I couldnapost play badminton, but now I can do it. The outdoor pond he used to have to bathe in is now covered in plants because he no longer needs it and Arya one day dreams of becoming a footballer. However, his incredible weight loss - he has now shed more than  stone - means he has been left with a huge amount of excess skin. He is now hoping to have this removed. And his parents are delighted their son is so much happier after shedding so much weight. His dad said: His attitude looks calm, ore cheerful and with his body weight now he can play football or volleyball with his friends. From what I observed about his mental state, he is more confident. His personal trainer has also described Arya as a symbol of hope for anyone who needs to lose weight.

It was route one stuff as the -cap Scotland international pinged a long ball up to Hemmings.

His effort took a deflection off the wall and Hazard could only palm the ball out, leaving McAlister with an easy finish.Seconds later Kalvin Orsi fired just over the bar as the home side had their tails up and the same player had the ball in the net from a superb overhead kick eight minutes before the break. The linesman#s flag, though, was already up for offside.After the break, Orsi looked certain to score only for Berra to get a vital toe on the ball at the last moment.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved.

every year shielding Scots from UK Government welfare cuts.\"That our devolved Government should have to protect its citizens from the cruelty of the UK state is unacceptable and unsustainable.ldquoAnd with the threat of Brexit still alive ndash the risk is real that tens of thousands more people could be pushed into poverty in Scotland, and left at the mercy of this heartless Tory government.ldquoOnly with full powers over social security can we begin to make Scotland an equal country with a dignied and fair welfare system. Until then, the SNP will continue to do everything in our power to tackle poverty and support low income families.Since its launch in April , the Scottish Welfare Fund has paid out almost pound million to over , households across the country ndash with , households in the Borders receiving help from the Scottish government fund.In total a third of households receiving awards were families

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"accuser-cross-examined-emails-weinstein","story":"A key accuser has told the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein that she stayed in touch with him after he allegedly raped her to protect her acting career, as the defence sought to paint her as opportunistic manipulator.Asked on cross-examination about warm emails she sent to the movie mogul, the -year-old woman responded: ldquoI wanted him to believe I wasnrsquot a threat.She later added: ldquoI was afraid of his unpredictable anger.Defence lawyer Donna Rotunno also grilled the woman about consensual sex with Weinstein that the accuser claimed only happened after ldquoa long negotiation.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

taken down, read: \"As part of our licensing it is our responsibility to ensure that we are protecting children from harm.\"Therefore adults in charge of children will be allowed to have one alcoholic drink and a further alcoholic drink with a sit-down meal.\"It has been a crime since  to be drunk in charge of a child under the age of seven in a public place.The offence can be punished by a fine or up to a month in jail.A spokesman for Wetherspoon,which has a pub on Musselburghs Bridge Street, The David Macbeth Moir,said: \"The manager took the decision to put the poster in the pub to emphasise to customers that she would not allow parents to drink while their children were running round uncontrolled in the pub.\"The notice had a positive effect, with mostly good feedback.\"Wetherspoonadded: \"There is a guideline, though not a policy, that we will serve the adult a maximum of two alcoholic drinks with their meal.\"The reason is that we dont want children being unruly in the pubs and parents thinking they can continue to drink while this happens.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lion-king-magical-stage-production-spine-tingling-sensation","story":"The loveable and heartwarming story of

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford.

And that wonrsquot be the only argument deployed against Indyref .Anyone who thinks Brexit will be done and dusted by May next year is living in a fools paradise. A bare-bones deal may well be struck by the December  deadline, covering free trade in goods, but huge questions of regulatory alignment will be outstanding.Nicola Sturgeon says confidently that the ldquoToaries will surely make a mess of Brexit and that that will be clear very soon as the impact of hard Brexit bites. But forecasts of doom have not had a good track record.Remainers in general have relied far too much on project fear. Planes falling out of the sky, food disappearing from the shelves, essential medicines not getting through. None of this has happened or is likely to happen.There is too much at stake for the EU and Britain not to come to a basic deal to keep things moving. The long-term economic effects of Brexit will undoubtedly be pretty dire. The Treasury forecast is that the UK will lose over % of GDP growth, which is as much as in a serious recession.But wersquove already lost % since , according to most estimates, and that hasnrsquot had much impact on Brexit opinion. Moreover, these forecasts are based on untested assumptions.Reduced immigration leads to lower growth, but it might also lead to higher wages being paid to workers already in the UK. Wage growth has been ticking up since Brexit.So we canrsquot rely on some popular revolt against Brexit, and anyway itrsquos not clear how a botched Brexit is going to make the case for Scottish independence.Westminster might just as well say that wersquove had enough of isive referendums. While the UK economy is under the stresses of transition, now is not the time for a Scottish independence referendum throwing another spanner in the works.Theresa May said exactly that in , and Boris Johnson, with his huge majority, is almost certain to say the same. Which means there will not be the ldquolegal and legitimate referendum which the First Minister says is the only one she will entertain.:Iain Macwhirter: Labour is on a loser with its unsubtle attack on nationalismShe did actually mention in her speech the possibility of a consultative referendum, and said that the time might come when Holyroodrsquos powers to hold such a referendum might he tested in court. There has been much learned discussion of this on the internet among legally-trained nationalists.However, she didnrsquot exactly bubble over with enthusiasm at the prospect. For Ms Sturgeon the only independence worth having is one recognised by Westminster, and the EU, as legitimate. That requires No. to agree a Section  Order allowing a legal and binding referendum to take place.She has a point. Unionists might boycott a consultative referendum. Local authorities would have to organise it and voters might regard it as a waste of money since the result doesnrsquot mean anything. Boris Johnson will certainly say that.So, it was another dose of sober realism from the FM on Friday. Wersquove been here before. Itrsquos not a great prospect for the legions of enthusiastic nationalists who have been led to believe that a referendum is just over the horizon. That horizon is getting more distant by the year.Some prominent nationalists believe the gamersquos a bogey. The most influential independence-supporting website, Wings over Scotland, has just thrown in the towel over Nicola Sturgeonrsquos legalistic approach. The Rev Stu says the site, which has a huge following, and raises six-figure sums each year, will notuntil Nicola Sturgeon is history.That may take a while. There is no obvious replacement for Ms Sturgeon. Shes been hugely successful in electoral terms and as this column has pointed out in the past, political parties are mainly concerned with winning and keeping seats. The SNP depends on the flow of cash and energy supplied by its MPs and MSPs. It doesnrsquot want a repeat of  when the SNP lost a third of its Westminster seats.The FM is a cautious lawyer, disinclined to lead from the front. Alex Salmond would probably be active in emulating Mandela. Organising campaigns of civil disobedience, withdrawing from Westminster, fighting in the courts, staging ldquoadvisory plebiscites. The kind of ldquoratchet\" approach advocated by The Common Weal activists.That might or might not work. But the question is irrelevant.

He backed his boss on not aligning with EU rules, or as he put it: ldquoLegislative alignment ndash it just ainrsquot happening.

The Calcutta Cup has always been one of my favourite events in the sporting calendar.And I admit there are few experiences so guaranteed to make me fill with emotion as that moment when the pipers fall silent and the Murrayfield crowd continue unaccompanied with ‘Flower of Scotland’.For  minutes England are the Auld Enemy and the taste of victory, on those occasions when we have it, is sweet. But it is a game. A game that I love, but a game nonetheless.And the rivalry is entirely about who will prove to have the more accomplished experience on the day. It is also the only time when I will wear national colours or consider waving a flag. Any flag.Don’t get me wrong there are occasions – like when I saw it fluttering in the breeze over the Church of Scotland in Jerusalem – when the sight of the Saltire fills me pride.And walking down Whitehall I get a huge sense of security from the Union Flag above parliament.: Brexit: EU flag will fly at Holyrood after Brexit, after government overturns decision of impartial parliament body: Why Scotland is still perfectly entitled to fly the Flag of Europe – John McLellanBut I have also come to resent the way in which flags have somehow become not just central to the political debate but regarded as central to what politics is about. I cannot see that.I care much more about tackling the homelessness that I see every day, even in the entrance to the parliament of the fth largest economy in the world.Or cleaning up the air that makes Edinburgh the most polluted city in Scotland and is now so dirty that a recent report estimated one in  deaths in our city is in some way attributable to it. And then there are the problems in our schools, our NHS, our public services and the sickening growth in food banks.Flag-waving doesn’t solve problemsNone of those issues will be resolved by waving a flag. Nor by wrapping ourselves in it and claiming that it somehow makes us more Scottish or British with an enhanced right to speak for the rest of us.They are not the preserve of any single political party, or to be used by them for narrow self-promoting purposes.Over the course of the past few years, I have begun to feel the same sense of attachment to the flag of the European Union as those of Scotland and the UK.But, unfortunately, that is also now being drawn into the political mud-slinging.For more than a decade, it has been flown proudly among the flags above the entrance to the Scottish Parliament. That flag represents a body which is now, sadly, no longer part of our constitutional framework. We are not entitled to either its protection or its patronage.And to that extent, the flag of the EU is no more relevant to our lives now than the flags of the United States, France, Germany, Japan or any other nation.Believe me, that is something which fills me with a huge sense of regret.I and my party, the Liberal Democrats, dedicated every possible moment we could, took every opportunity available and followed every route open to us to keep us in the European Union.In the end, we couldn’t and so it is no longer our flag to wave. I imagineScotland had voted to leave the UK in  many of us would have found ourselves in the same situation with the Union Flag.Union Jacks after independence And , for example, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Highland or any other local authority chose to continue to fly it above their headquarters or for that matter a pro-UK political party in administration at Holyrood in future raised it above parliament, there would be an outcry from the nationalists.Which is why I find the current attack on the corporate body of the Scottish Parliament and, for that matter, the Liberal Democrats so offensive.My colleague Liam McArthur MSP reminded the Scottish Parliament this week that the flying of the EU flag was a reflection of our membership of the EU and removing it does not make us anti-European as leaving it up would not make us pro-European.The flag is, he said, “a statement of legal fact and not a political desire”. But the latter is exactly what it is being usurped for. A political move designed to fan the flames of a particular desire by one party to promote its own agenda. That is not what I believe my parliament, or its flags, are for.They are there to represent the people of Scotland, regardless of their politics, religion or any other inidual factor.And, above all , they are a symbol of the sources from which the Parliament takes its authority. Those are now only the UK and the people of Scotland.I do not want to see the flag of the EU removed, that single act would represent everything I and so many other people have worked so hard not to lose. But I accept that it should be.Our attention now should be on working for the best possible relationship with our neighbours for the good of us all.And let’s keep our flag waving to the sports arenas.Christine Jardine is the Liberal Democrat MP for Edinburgh West©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"here s how scottish government can prove its commitment to tackling climate emergency steven heddle","story":"The Scottish Government has declared a climate emergency and now it must demonstrate its commitment to the issue by giving local authorities the necessary funds, writes Councillor Steven Heddle.In April , the First Minister told her party’s conference that she was declaring a “climate emergency” in Scotland. She pledged to “live up to our responsibility” to future generations and announced that the Scottish Government would legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by , five years ahead of the UK as a whole.As bold and progressive as these targets are, it will require leadership at all levels of government to realise them. Crucially, it will require Scotland’s  local authorities to help address climate change.Councils are the sphere of government closest to our communities. Our unique reach and vast remit of policy areas mean that we have a huge impact across the country. From the businesses that councils choose to support to the planning applications that are approved from the types of houses and public buildings we build to our investment in sustainable transport, roads and paths, local action is critical to our success.: Douglas Millican: Climate change water strategy must stand the test of time: ‘Catastrophic’ climate change is accelerating faster than predictedThis is an internationally recognised conclusion. The Paris climate accord, where  countries agreed to determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that they undertake to mitigate global warming, was unreserved in recommending that councils are a core part of the fight against climate change. “The Conference of the Parties recognises the need to strengthen knowledge, technologies, practices and efforts of local communities and indigenous peoples related to addressing and responding to climate change,” it said.Disproportionate share of cutsThis is a call to arms for every local politician in the world, that the fight against climate change will be aided locally, with local government at its heart.This will not be done on the cheap, however. A fight such as this requires the means to be able to do so. Investment in our critical leadership role is required to focus on the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. One that breaks down the barriers our citizens face and creates a new set of opportunities for our workforce.On Thursday, the Government will announce its budget for the coming year. It will be important that it recognises the “climate emergency”. There is a need for a budget to help combat the global emergency – a fight that will not be won when council core budgets are under threat.Over a number of years, local government budgets have decreased signicantly. Between - overall funding has gone down in real terms by seven per cent. In comparison the Scottish Government has had its funding reduced by only two per cent. We are the sphere of government closest to Scotland’s communities, yet we are being passed a disproportionate share of cuts compared to our national counterparts.More funds from UKThe services that are at risk when our core budgets are under threat are exactly the kind that are essential in combating climate change.If we are to encourage our citizens to stop using their vehicles to help reduce emissions, then why would we cut a budget that funds passenger and community transport If we want our homes, public buildings and businesses to use less energy, then why would we cut a budget that provides energy efficiency advice and grants Andwe want to provide our communities with facilities to recycle, then why would we cut a budget for waste services The Scottish Government has a chance to address climate change at every level. We need a fair funding commitment for local government that looks across the whole system. All the signs are that Scotland will see a cash increase from the UK Government, this must be passed on to local government.Strong local leadership will be requiredwe are to truly meet these ambitious  targets. The Scottish Government has a chance to invest in councils so we can develop world-class digital infrastructure, enable the transformation of services and reduce the need for travel so we can enable investment in cleaner, greener public transport and buildings so we can support businesses across all sectors to achieve zero carbon emissions and so we can provide and maintain vibrant green spaces across the country.We cannot afford to look at the local government settlement narrowly. It must be viewed in its entirety to reflect the whole-system approach that is required to tackle and address the biggest challenges facing Scotland and threatening the sustainability of our communities, the communities that councils look after and invest in every day, of every week, of every year.Councillor Steven Heddle is environment and economy spokesperson for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence is not inevitable nothing in politics is brian monteith","story":"I have never been a believer about inevitability of political outcomes. I remember how we were constantly being told by what was the Europhile establishment that joining the euro was inevitable. Well, look at us now. Not only did we dodge that bullet but we have finally left the European Union.There are some who claim or imply Scottish independence is inevitable. Part of their reasoning is the UK’s departure from the EU will cause such a rt with the rest of the UK the Scottish people, when given the chance, will choose the European continent over our island brethren. It’s inevitable, they say.I choose to dfer. In  the SNP would have taken Scotland out of the EU in pursuit of achieving independence now the SNP pushes EU membership as its major reason for independence. Believing in political inevitability is a foolhardy self-deception. We do not know what the future holds, nor can we tell what geo-political events might arise and how they shall impact on our thinking or that of future generations. It would be just as foolish for me to claim the unity of the United Kingdom is inevitable. It is not, its benefits require to be repeatedly explained or their attraction may fade and the Union fall accidentally into abeyance.I am moved to ponder how political developments can come at us from nowhere rather than be inevitable because of the historical rupture between our country and the European Union on Friday night. It was the Scot, Alan Sked, now professor emeritus at the London School of Economics,who founded what became Ukip following the EU’s Maastricht Treaty. Nigel Farage joined Ukip and in  was elected to be an MEP along with just two other colleagues. When they arrived in Brussels they were treated as a British curiosity and a joke. No one in the European Union’s elite are laughing now.Was our departure inevitable  No. Had Margaret Thatcher not been deposed by her EU-phile critics it is hard to believe she would have accepted the treaty. Indeed, the written evidence of a letter to Bill Cash, MP, states she would not have agreed to it. No Maastricht would mean no Ukip and no Farage . EU-philes should have been careful what they wished for.Likewise, was the outcome of the  referendum inevitable  No. It is conveniently forgotten how Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg had called for a referendum on EU membership because he believed endorsing membership would kill the issue stone dead and allow the UK to play a more active role building ever closer union across Europe. He should have been more careful what he wished for.Similarly, Prime Minister David Cameron thought he could heal the ide in the Conservative Party over EU membership by holding a referendum. He believedhe negotiated fresh membership terms he could demonstrate how helpful and warm EU leaders were towards our country and that reform of the institutions was possible from within. Well, he certainly initiated the healing of the ide in the Tory Party – for it is more united now than at any time in my living memory – but not in the manner he anticipated. Cameron miscalculated badly on the motives of EU leaders. Just imaginethey had given him some genuine changes in our terms of membership. Imaginehe had been able to come back from Brussels with something substantial that limited the centrugal forces of ever closer union  Cameron’s Eurosceptic critics would have been muted and sounded shrillheard at all, while the EU’s advocates would have turned up the volume to . Instead of being able to run a positive campaign about EU co-operation, cohesion and solidarity the EU-philes were put on the back foot embarrassed by EU technocratic indference they were forced to rely on the Treasury’s project fear playbook that had nearly lost the union to secessionists in the independence referendum two years before. This time the suggested nightmare scenarios became more and more absurd and thus their campaign more and more disreputable. Last Wednesday I held my nose and voted in the European Parliament for a rotten transition agreement that would take us out of the EU two days later. On Thursday I made the last speech of any MEP on the subject of the UK’s departure, explaining how our Prime Minister’s legal enactment of having no further extension of membership and his public commitment to allowing ergence in our laws where we choose made my support possible. On Friday I joined the tens of thousands in Parliament Square, celebrating my redundancy as an MEP and my job was done.None of that process or the outcome it led to was inevitable. All of it had to be fought for all of the plans, strategies, tactics and reasoning in the ensuing debates had to be adjusted repeatedly to take account of events – such as President Obama saying we would be sent to the back of the “queue” .The lessons of what should be seen as the Great European Disruption should be understood and learned by those wishing to defend the United Kingdom. Its maintenance is not inevitable. It requires blood, sweat and toil. It cannot be about economics alone, but should be about solidarity, community and harmony. Its advocates and their advocacy must have a positive tale to tell.By May this year Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP shall have been in power for  years – the majority of the period we have had a Scottish Parliament responsible and accountable for Scotland’s health, education, justice and economic development. It has been a time when even more powers have been transferred from London to Edinburgh – and yet the standards and outcomes that were claimed would improve have in so many cases fallen. The SNP’s focus on the constitutional debate is undoubtedly a large part of the reason. Yet the SNP appears poised to remain in power. We should remember, however, that nothing in politics is inevitable.Brian Monteith is no longer a member of the European Parliament.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll support for scottish independence and the union both at 50","story":"A new opinion poll on voting intention in a second Scottish independence referendum has both the #yes# and #no# camps on  per cent each.The Survation poll, carried out on behalf of Progress Scotland, the pro-independence think tank, also gives the SNP a majority in next year’s Holyrood elections.The new poll comes just a week after a YouGov survey saw “yes” inch into a slight lead on  per cent, with many Remain voters in the EU referendum switching from “no” to back independence as a result of Brexit.: Poll in five years shows majority of Scots want independenceHowever it also found that one in ten were undecided on how they would vote in a new referendum, and just over four per cent said they wouldn’t vote at all.Carried out nine days before Brexit, the poll of , people aged  and over, was conducted through an invited online .

The longer Boris Johnson tries to ignore the SNP’s democratic mandate the more support for independence will continue to grow.”Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said the poll showed how many Scots were still undecided. “With one-in-ten Scots undecided, this poll is a reminder to those of us who believe in solidarity and oppose ision that we must continue to make the positive case for remaining in the UK every day,” she said.“We know the overwhelming majority of people in Scotland don’t want a isive second independence referendum this year, but Nicola Sturgeon is ramping up her campaign in a desperate bid to deflect from the SNP’s failings in office.“She should stop trying to ide Scotland and focus on fixing the public services her government has run into the ground. Scotland deserves better.”On people’s voting intention in the  Holyrood election, the poll put the SNP on  per cent, the Conservatives on  per cent, Labour  per cent, and the Liberal Democrats on seven per cent in the constituency vote and in the regional list, the SNP won  per cent, Conservatives  per cent, Labour  per cent, Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats on nine per cent each.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish greens ready to walk away from budget deal with snp","story":"Finance Secretary Derek Mackay will publish his budget for   on Thursday, but Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie has scoffed at claims that the \"global climate emergency\" will be at the heart of the spending plans.\"The Scottish Greens have worked hard over recent years to put constructive pressure on the Government to secure environmental protections, as well as a fairer tax system to help fund council services,\" Mr Harvie said today. - Four passengers collapse on Scotland-bound Ryanair flight from hell\"That must mean shting decisively away from high-carbon spending, as the Governmentrsquos own Infrastructure Commission has said.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"orangemen aim to scale kilimanjaro","story":"A dozen Orangemen from Co Down are planning an ambitious trip to Africa during which they will attempt to scale Mount Kilimanjaro.The men from Banbridge District No  have a proud history of undertaking gruelling fundraising ventures, with this particular challenge requiring two years of groundwork.Deputy District Master Stuart Magill said: “In this last  years at Banbridge Orange Hall we’ve raised over £, for dferent causes and charities.“Drumming For Heroes from LOL  has raised £,. They’ve carried a Lambeg drum up to the top of Ben Nevis and cycled from John O’Groats to Landsend with a Lambeg on the back of a bike. “They also did the four peaks of the UK in four days, and walked the route of King Billy from the south of England to Carrickfergus and down to the Boyne, also bringing the Lambeg.”Banbridge Orange Hall is home to several dferent lodges including LOL  and LOL  of which Stuart is a member. “This time it will be our lodge that’s doing Kilimanjaro though we won’t be bringing a Lambeg – it’s going to be hard enough as it is,” he continued. “It’s a follow up to the Walk of Remembrance when we walked  miles from Thiepval Memorial to Menin Gate.”The -year-old added: “It was my idea to climb Killimanjaro. I’ve never done it before, that’s why I want to do it. “There’s  of us doing it. My biggest worry was getting .

There’s a big build to allow us to pay for it, the cost of the trip is coming out of each person’s pocket so that every penny raised is going to the charity. It also gives us plenty of time to train for it, and also to raise money for the two charities.”Two charities are set to benefit – the Children’s Cancer Unit in Royal Victoria Hospital and Angel Wishes which helps children with cancer and supports their families.He said the two charities were close to the hearts of those taking part in the trek as they were good friends with a family from Banbridge who are indebted to the services provided by the organisations.In pictures: NI man finds beauty in derelict properties around the Province Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Stuart said: “The oldest person taking part is in his sixties and the youngest is in his twenties. “The majority of training will be in the Mournes for fitness and stamina, but there’s no training over here really for the altitude.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sdlp urges parties to continue working together after eu exit","story":"Nichola Mallon PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNichola Mallon By Christopher LeebodyFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe SDLP has made a renewed call for parties here to find a way forward through Brexit together after Friday#s historic exit from the European Union.Nichola Mallon said that while all the parties here dfered in their position on Brexit, all agree that the way in which Northern Ireland is being dragged out of the EU is not acceptable.During the first main sitting of the restored Assembly last month, all the Stormont parties rejected the Government#s EU withdrawal plan without dissent, following a near three-hour debate in the chamber.The SDLP#s Assembly leader urged the parties here to work collaboratively as the Brexit process moves forward into the transition period, in which key trading agreements are set to be decided over a period of  months.We believe Brexit is a socio-economic and political disaster for all people living on these islands, said Ms Mallon.There is a responsibility on all parties in the Assembly to resist the opportunity to point-score and instead to show real leadership and maturity.While we certainly welcome the fact that there is to be no border on this island, we recognise the serious consequences for our business communityunfettered access is not secured for trade east-west also.The possibility of a new clf edge into a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year still looms.New questions remain unanswered on trade and future relationships.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadBrexit: Parties and protests in Northern Ireland as UK leaves the EUSDLP urges parties to continue working together after EU exitNo signs of Brexit unity in Northern Ireland as new era dawnsUK Government can#t guarantee #frictionless trade#after Brexit, admits Michael GoveBeers over Brexit: #Le goes on# say Belfast pub goers,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

entered its final week, with all parties and independent candidates preparing to make their final pitches to voters.Speaking in Dublin on Monday, Mr Donohoe said: “Not all change can be risk-free and not all change can be positive.“What we are going to be doing as we head into the final week of the campaign is emphasising that in our manesto and in the plans that we have published we have recognised the progress that has been made in our country – due to the sacrices of the Irish people – and making the claim to the Irish people that change is happening and we are ambitious for more change to happen.”He added: “In relation to Fianna Fail and the changes they say they will make – where are their plans  Where is their detail “We will be building on what we have already done, acknowledging what needs to be done and be unapologetic in challenging other parties that are putting forward mantras of change but in offering these mantras of change.“Fianna Fail are putting forward their worst hits of their recent past and what Sinn Fein are offering is the kind of ideas that will do such harm to workers income, to wages and to their jobs.“They have claimed they are going to put forward new ideas for investment involving  dferent tax hikes – tax hikes that would be bad for those at work, tax hikes that would be bad for those looking to create jobs.”Live Press Conference with

property tax.Outlining Fianna Fail’s strategy for the final campaigning days, Mr McGrath used the opportunity to hit out at Sinn Fein, who tied first place with the party in a recent opinion poll.“These policies are fantasy policies that will not add up in the real world,” he said.“In the real world, people change their behaviour, they make investment decisions depending on the change in taxation and enterprise landscape in the country.“Sinn Fein want to make this a very cold place for business. They want to tax employment through increasing PRSI , they want to tax people over , euro under the pretence that won’t affect anybody below , euro.”Speaking at their election headquarters in Dublin, Mr McGrath also claimed Sinn Fein’s tax policies will “boomerang back into the face of the very people that they are saying they’re going to help”.Do not underestimate the strength of will within the Fianna Fail party who have all rejected the prospect of a Fianna Fail-Sinn Fein coalitionMicheal Martin, Fianna FailOn Monday Mr Martin was pressed on his party’s position on going into Government with Sinn Fein after a number of his TDs and candidates indicated they would be open to working with Mary Lou McDonald’s party.“It’s not just about the past but about the future as well,” Mr Martin told RTE.“Do not underestimate the strength of will within the Fianna Fail party who have all rejected the prospect of a Fianna Fail-Sinn Fein coalition.”Asked about Mr Varadkar’s comments that Fianna Fail has “a lot of backwoodsmen”, Mr Martin said it was beneath the office of An Taoiseach. vw,vw,px, px\"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fine Gael candidate Gabrielle McFadden canvassing at the Sheraton Shopping Centre in Athlone, Co Westmeath Mr Varadkar kicked off his final week of campaigning saying he will work until the final moments to convince people to vote for Fine Gael.He raised concerns over other parties’ pledges to reduce the pension age back to .“I appreciate what we’re offering is less than what the other parties are offering on this but I’m concerned that what’s happening is an auction and an auction that could result in us auctioning off the pensions of the young,” he said.Acknowledging Fine Gael is behind in the opinion polls, he claimed they are only a “snapshot in time”.Mr Varadkar welcomed RTE’s decision saying it will provide an opportunity to scrutinise and “expose” Sinn Fein’s policies.Speaking in Co Tipperary on Monday, he said: “If you look at their manesto – no carbon tax, no property tax, reducing the USC for people and no college fees. They say this will all be paid for massive taxes on business.“That might work for a year or two butyou impose that much tax to businesses and jobs and pension pots and wealth, what happens after a few years is that businesses close, investment goes to other countries, wealth leaves and we lose the battle for talent and you end up with the poorest people who always suffer when that happens.”Press AssociationRelated ContentRepublic of IrelandSinn Fein poll rise unnerves rivals in Republic of IrelandFine Gael and Fianna Fail are locked in an Irish general election battle to hold the centre ground in the Republic#s politics as Sinn Fein#s support grows.OpinionCommentOpinionEamon Delaney:Fianna Fail and Fine Gael cast Sinn Fein as the wolf in the fading balaclava, yet those same two parties want them at StormontThe Republic#s election pantomime is going into its final week, with a plethora of parties and lots of bickering and slagging, fed by social media and TV debates with people shouting at each other.

Founded in , the St. Patrick’s Societysmission is to promote the cultural and social values of Irish people.I met some of the committee members by chance at the opening of an Irish bar in Bangkok, including Derry man Kevin McHugh and they asked me to get involved, she said.It was lovely to meet someone from Derry because its a bit of a home away from home.Through the St. Patrick’s Society I met a nun called Sister Louise who has been a missionary for  years and she asked meI would help get the girls ready for their performance at the ball.Despite only having been to Irish dancing lessons for a year or two as a child Miss Deeney agreed to help and she was soon putting the pupils through their paces.I was able to show they how to stand and how to point their toe an do the jumps right, she explained.The girls love Irish dancingand they make their own dresses.They recently performed at an Irish Embassy event and it was so lovely because they are showcasing our culture to diplomats from around the world.Miss Deeney says the girls will be over the moon when they see the kind gts arrive from Derry. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Police received a report at around .am on Thursday, January , of a suspicious object at Caw Close. The PSNI said officers were on the scene at .am. Officers attended and following a search of the area discovered a second suspicious object nearby. Both objects were then examined by ATO and were declared as small, exploded pipe bomb type devices. A PSNI spokesperson added: “Reports were then received of loud bangs in the area between the hours of pm on Thursday night and midnight. There have been no reports of any injuries with minor damage caused to the front windows of two houses.” googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said it was his understanding that police were on the scene earlier but Army Technical Officersdidn’t arrive until pm. “ATO is not based locally and normally takes longer to get here,” he explained. Over the years his party colleague Gregory Campbell has pushed for a bomb squad base to be located in Derry. Thursday’s incident has brought the issue to the fore once again and Mr Middleton said response times would be quickera unit was based in the North West. “It causes a large amount of disruption and people are often put out of their houses for long periods of time. googletag.cmd.push “We don’t want to see any incidents but realistically people still want to cause disruption and that’s the reason we absolutely need the ATO in the North West. It would help clear the area quicker. “There had been a suggestion in the past that it could be at Maydown.” ‘Anger’ SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin has also condemned those behind an explosion at Caw Close in the Waterside area of Derry last night. The Foyle MLA said that local people were left distressed and angry as they were forced from their homes by those intent on dragging this community backward. She continued: “Residents in the Waterside area of the city were left distressed and angry today after they were forced from their homes by thugs who left a crude but viable bomb in the area. “Those responsible have nothing to offer this community. We are trying to build a better Derry and acts like this only make that harder. They have to be faced down.” “I would appeal to anyone with information to bring it forward.” Officers would like to thank all those affected by this alert for their patience whilst they worked to keep them safe and appealed to anyone with any information about the incident or anyone who was driving in the area and who may have dash cam footage available to contact detectives in Strand Road on  quoting reference number    . Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on    which is % anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

I got this cold off all the little two and three year olds in nursery, not that I actually wanted it you understand. Of course I understand we can’t keep our children off nursery because of a snfle, butthey’ve a proper cold with coughs, sneezes and that yucky green stuff it means they are not well - not well enough to be in nursery. For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs. We already have an excellent hospital and fantastic staff, but the community deserves what everyone  has.ldquoWe also need to to engage with local medical providers who are the experts.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

The new Upper Bann MLA said that while Northern Ireland was doing well on decarbonising electricity production, it was not doing so well on heat.Referring to “a renewable heat scheme for the future”, Mrs Dodds said: “I am determined that we will take our time, that we will get the issues rightand that there will be no repeat of the mistakes of the past.”When asked by the SDLPshe had engaged with the around , businesses with boilers on the scheme, she said that “the answer for me is no, I have not engaged personally I am relatively new in post”.Mrs Dodds said it was “too soon to say” how much compensation would be paid to claimantsthe scheme is shut.She said that she wanted to engage with participants “in a way that is fair, in a way that is compassionate, and in a way that addresses the issues that we have experienced in the past”.She also revealed that there are  applications for the voluntary buy-out which are now under assessment by her department but no offers have yet been made.Luton Airport hits back at Harpenden campaign group over claims its flights breach night-time curfew Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"When asked how many boilers have been inspected and found to be non-comppliant, Mrs Dodds said that  sites had been inspected. However, she did not say how many had been found to be in breach of the rules. Other sources suggest that very few people have been found to be in breach of the regulations.The shambolic handling of RHI – which at one time Stormont estimated would mean an overspend of £ million over  years – has now led to a massive underspend of money available to Northern Ireland to incentivise renewable heat.Mrs Dodds told MLAs that the current RHI scheme is now spending about £ million per year out of a budget from the Treasury of £ million.TUV leader Jim Allister pressed Mrs Dodds around the implications of closing the scheme and pushing current claimants towards reverting to fossil fuels at a time when the Executive says that it wants to prioritise the decarbonisation of the economy.Mrs Dodds said that she did not want to see that happen and urged iniduals to take part in a consultation on the Executive’s new energy strategy.try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementNI snow alert: Heavy snowfall expected overnight - temperature to feel a bitterly cold -degCNI snow  ice alert: Hour-by-hour NI weather forecast for duration of Met Office yellow status weather warningMan stabbed in face - PSNI deny tongue cut from mouth after gruesome image appears on social mediaStephen Nolan challenges everyone to join him in weight loss challenge afterdisappointment of putting weight back on remains profound        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Latest News\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
