God dammit! I thought the b***h was white! F**k! she roared in the video, posted to herYouTube page with the caption: \u0027Roseanne, like always, cuts through the bullsh** and gets the heart of the matter.\u0027The clip comes two months after Roseanne\u0027s eponymous reboot was axed when she tweeted that former Obama advisor  Jarrett, who is African American, looked like the \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Scroll down for video           Roseanne Barr has posted a bizarre new video where literally screams her defense of why she posted the racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett which got her show cancelledThe 65-year-old immediately backtracked in the wake of furious backlash, claiming it was a \u0027joke\u0027, blaming her Ambien sleeping tablets, and claiming she didn\u0027t know Jarrett was African American but believed she was Jewish and Persian.In a since deleted Twitter rant from May, she says she told President of Disney-ABC Television Group Ben Sherwood: \u0027I thought she was white, she looks like my family!\u0027\u0027I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist b*****s out...Papa Johns is hit with second scandal as bosses are accused...Share this article    Barr followed through with her promise when she posted the bizarre video of her speaking about the tweet on her YouTube page on Thursday           The actress looked disheveled and increasingly agitated, smoking a cigarette and repeatedly running her hands through her hair as she was interviewed by someone off camera          \u0027I thought the b***h was white! God dammit! I thought the b***h was white! F**k!\u0027 she roared in the videoBarr\u0027s son Jake also shared text exchanges with his mother to seemingly prove she was not racist.\u0027Her and her dad, I thought they were white,\u0027 Barr wrote in a text message she purportedly sent her son. She followed that up by saying: \u0027I would never have called a black woman an ape I\u0027m not stupid!\u0027 That is a lie however, with Barr having called former national security advisor Susan Rice just that in a 2014 tweet. The third text stated: \u0027I thought she was Jewish of Iranian.\u0027 Her son captioned the image by writing: \u0027Mom and I are too dumb for the internet lol.\u0027           Barr tweeted that former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett (pictured), who is African American, looked like the \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.          Roseanne Barr posted the initial offending tweet on May 29, which she attempted to backtrack on minutes later, claiming \u0027Muslims r NOT a race\u0027 then apologizing Barr, who claimed her whole life has been about fighting racism\u0027, also claimed she had been \u0027Ambien tweeting\u0027 when she sent the offensive tweet.\u0027I\u0027m not a racist, I never was \u0026amp I never will be. One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027The pharmaceutical firm which produces Ambien later hit back saying \u0027racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.\u0027Barr has faced huge backlash in the wake of her tweets, including from her former costars, who lost their jobs when ABC axed the series.Several of her costars, including Wanda Sykes, announced they would be leaving the show over the racial slur.          In the early hours of May 30, just 24 hours after posting the racial slur, Roseanne claimed in two tweets minutes apart she believed that Jarrett was Jewish and Persian, or white   Contextual: Her son  shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled          On May 30, Barr claimed she had begged Ben Sherwood, then president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, to not cancel her show and let her \u0027make amends\u0027          She said that she thought Jarrett \u0027was white, she looks like my family!\u0027 she tweeted          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it The network has since announced  a Roseanne spinoff about the Conner family which will air in the fall without the disgraced star.Meanwhile, Roseanne is reportedly working on her own talk show which she will host on her YouTube channel.She\u0027s been working with her son Jake\u0027s Full Moon \u0026amp High Tide studio to interview friends and family, including Barr’s boyfriend Johnny Argent, former Roseanne crew member Allan Stephan and ex campaign manager Thomas Muhammad, TMZ reported.Thursday\u0027s YouTube clip was reportedly a preview of the show’s first episode. There is no set release date or name for the show.Barr has apologized for her tweets, saying she didn\u0027t mean to hurt anyone and that she\u0027s regretted the tweets, even before saying in an interview she \u0027lost everything.\u0027She later stated that she would not be speaking to the media any more, but would be addressing her fans \u0027directly\u0027 to \u0027cut out any middlemen who use for clickbaitad revenue while seeking to ide rather than unite.\u0027Barr followed through with her promise when she posted the bizarre video of her speaking about the tweet on her YouTube page on Thursday.    It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.                          "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/21/00/4E72530100000578-5976287-image-a-38_1532129021809.jpg","title":"Revealing portrait Prince George fifth birthday","story":"    Prince George attends the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Polo Club, Tetbury          A photograph taken in London on July 2, 2014, to mark Britain\u0027s Prince George\u0027s first birthday           Prince George looks at his sister Princess Charlotte  in her pram on the Sandringham Estate          President Barack Obama, Prince William and First Lady Michelle Obama talks with Prince George          George enjoys weekends at Anmer Hall, visits to farm parks and country showsIt is an image of George, however, that friends of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge insist belies the happy, confident child their firstborn is developing into.

The Queen hails the \u0027tenacity, skill and...Share this articleThe past year has been a formative one for George the family moved back to London from their cloistered life at Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, and he started school.His nerves on his first day at Thomas’s Battersea, in West London, were apparent, despite his parents arranging for a discreet, five-strong group of media to capture the moment, as opposed to the hundred-plus assembled to document William’s arrival at prep school at the same age.The duke admits his own experiences as a young boy — the mass photocalls and what he views as an overwhelming public interest in himself and brother, Harry — had been hard to deal with.He has made clear that he will be much more cautious with his own children, striking a careful balance between allowing people to share in their growing up, without making the youngsters feel they are constantly in the public eye.Some have questioned whether William and Kate’s understandable protectiveness of their son, plus their instinctive wariness of the media, may have inadvertently rubbed off on George. But friends insist he is no different from other young children. ‘Just because he reacts more cautiously than Charlotte when there is a camera around isn’t an indication of what he is like behind closed doors,’ says one. ‘Your first day at school is a big enough deal without all these strange people watching you. He is a very happy little boy.’William and Kate hope their choice of school, albeit one in the heart of an affluent area of the capital that has been dubbed Nappy Valley, will offer their son the chance to develop in a more rounded environment than other young royals.‘They thought long and hard about where George should be educated and really liked Thomas’s, which has a lovely nurturing atmosphere,’ a source said.‘The school focuses as much on helping develop the character of pupils, as what they learn. William and Kate are keen to allow George to spread his wings and make friends at this stage.‘They know there will come a time when they will have to sit down and talk to him about the implications of his royal status and why so many people are interested in him. He is becoming more aware of the cameras. But they are determined to do that at George’s own pace and feel that can all wait a bit.’          Prince William with Prince George on his son\u0027s first day of school on September 7, 2017Carole, 63, and her husband Michael, 69, play a hugely significant role in their grandchildren’s lives — as their current Caribbean holiday together shows. She has taken George and Charlotte to work at the family’s Party Pieces HQ, a short drive from the Middletons’ Berkshire mansion, where they play at being shopkeepers.One visitor spotted George sitting in the ‘front of house’, exclaiming excitedly ‘Oh my gosh!’ as his indulgent granny gave him a bag of sweets for being a good boy.Kate understands only too well that it is a grandparent’s prerogative to spoil their grandchildren — and still laughs about how she once called home from a foreign tour to speak to her mother, who was looking after George, only for him to tell her earnestly that his granny had given him ‘chips, again’ for dinner.With a loving, extended family around him, determined to protect him from the pressures of royal life for as long as they possibly can, it’s no wonder that George is growing into such a settled little boy.And who knows, one day he still may be able to become a pilot — just like Papa. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/09/4DDEDC4900000578-0-image-a-11_1530606342861.jpg","title":"Susanna Reid says Twitter trolls wont drive Good Morning Britain","story":"    Good Morning Britain presenter and  Susanna Reid has hit out at those who abuse her online\u0027This is like Mao’s China\u0027: Piers Morgan compares schools...\u0027Who\u0027s giving him PR advice?\u0027 Princess Diana\u0027s former butler...‘I’ve changed my mind about Meghan’s dad – he’s just a shy,...Share this articleBut Ms Reid has insisted she is unmoved by the abuse.

These boys are saying “we missed out on our fathers, we’re not going to miss out on our children.”’She gave an example of one young couple – a male teacher and female doctor - who have both gone part-time.    The BBC Radio 4 presenter said it was the ‘ideal solution’ rather than one parent having to give up work or otherwise sending young children to the nursery‘They don’t have childcare, they manage it between them so both can keep their jobs and they can both be good parents. That, for me, would be the ideal solution,’ she said. Responding to a question about whether modern feminism is devaluing traditional motherhood, Dame Jenni said women choosing to give up work to bring up children is ‘absolutely right if it’s your choice’.‘The people who matter in all this are the kids,’ she said.Dame Jenni, 68, told how attitudes to parenting were once very different with her mother having to give up her job as a civil servant once she married ‘as it was assumed she would start a family’.And she said that, during the 1980s, she asked Margaret Thatcher about whether her government would be willing to help mothers wanting to go back to work.Mrs Thatcher replied: ‘Perhaps women could work a couple of days and find a kindly aunt or grandparents to help.’But Dame Jenni said: ‘She managed to do what she did because she had her wealthy husband to help with the childcare costs of their two children.’The author also said she was ‘ashamed there are no sports women’ in her latest book, A History of Britain in 21 Women.‘I think it’s because, apart from riding horses, I haven’t been involved in any sport apart from watching my son,’ she said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/23/01/4E809EEC00000578-5980695-image-a-34_1532304279265.jpg","title":"Strictly Come Dancing Shirley Ballas finds ancestors slaves BBC Think Are","story":"Strictly Come Dancing star Shirley Ballas (pictured) was moved to tears when she found out her ancestors were sold as slaves on the BBC\u0027s Who Do You Think You Are? Strictly Come Dancing star Shirley Ballas was moved to tears when she found out her ancestors were sold as slaves.She was always intrigued by rumours her paternal grandfather had mixed race heritage and decided to sign up for the BBC\u0027s Who Do You Think You Are? But things got emotional when the 57-year-old discovered her four-times great grandmother was sold as a child slave in South Africa after being snatched from Madagascar.She told The Sun: \u0027It was heart-breaking, it was an emotional journey.

Some experts, he added, \u0027warn that complete and verified denuclearization could take 15 years.\u0027So after the head-spinning events and reversals of the past six months, it may now be time to dig in for a long wait.To some observers, moreover, the loss of momentum that Singapore should have provided is worrying. There have been few if any real advances.Even the North\u0027s return to the US of the remains of American soldiers killed in the Korean War (1950-53), described as \u0027immediate\u0027 on June 12, appears more complicated - with Pompeo now saying it may take place in \u0027the next couple of weeks.\u0027For now, the only concrete results of the Washington-Pyongyang thaw are the North\u0027s halt to nuclear and missile testing and the American side\u0027s suspension of planned military maneuvers with South Korea, long denounced as a \u0027provocation\u0027 by Pyongyang.The US had long rejected such a \u0027double freeze.\u0027 It involves gestures that could be reversed in a moment.\u0027If our goal still is the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of the North Korean nuclear program, we\u0027re not succeeding,\u0027 said Sue Mi Terry of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, speaking to a security conference in Aspen, Colorado.\u0027Not only are they not giving up their nuclear weapons program,\u0027 she continued, \u0027they\u0027ve been working overtime on advancing their program.\u0027The Trump administration, criticized for failing to obtain a written promise of this key objective in Singapore, now insists negotiations are progressing toward the North\u0027s \u0027final, fully verified\u0027 denuclearization. But a Pompeo visit to North Korea in early July was \u0027by all accounts except his own deeply disappointing,\u0027 said Jeffrey Bader and Ryan Hass in an article for the Brookings Institution. The problem, say the two experts, is that in Singapore, \u0027Trump gave away much of that leverage\u0027 to ensure the North\u0027s cooperation.And now the international campaign of \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 on Pyongyang - the stringent sanctions and the diplomatic isolation that Washington helped orchestrate - is beginning to weaken.\u0027The sanctions are already loosening,\u0027 said Terry, \u0027because China is not really implementing\u0027 them.Hence Pompeo\u0027s visit to the UN on Friday to condemn the erosion of the sanctions regime and to demand that the international community maintain serious pressure.But this could be a challenge, experts say. \u0027Maximum pressure\u0027 will be difficult to maintain in the absence of some new North Korean provocation.\u0027In case it doesn\u0027t work, we need to have a plan,\u0027 Terry said. \u0027We don\u0027t really have a Plan B.\u0027 North Korea wants US to make \u0027bold move\u0027 towards peace before denuclearization: source - CNNPolitics"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/23/4E0BEAC200000578-0-image-m-8_1531089627273.jpg","title":"Terrified dog forces emergency landing Moscow opening luggage hatch","story":"    Dogs often travel in the cargo hold on passenger flights, but in this case the animal managed to get out of its cage and in amongst the baggage, where it tore the inner lining and opened the front half-door (file photo)This triggered the emergency alarm above, while the plane was at an altitude of 13,000 feet and approaching the Russian capital.The commander of the Boeing 737, which took off from St. Petersburg, was forced to alert the ground services to the situation and perform an emergency landing, RT reported. A source at Moscow\u0027s Sheremetyevo Airport said that in its desperation to escape the dog \u0027tore the inner lining of the luggage compartment and somehow provoked the opening of its front half-door.\u0027Plane as day!

Some pictures are best left to the imagination.\u0027          The 180-million-year sandstone cliffs are prone to regular and sudden rockfalls, especially after periods of prolonged dry weather.Shocked photographer Graham Hunt was on the beach when he saw the woman perched on the cliff top. He said: \u0027You just don\u0027t expect somebody to do that, especially off 150ft cliffs which are crumbling and brittle because of the recent hot weather.\u0027There are frequent rockfalls there and one wrong step could have ended in tragedy.\u0027It was a case of holiday madness with people wanting to get selfies on the Broadchurch cliffs.\u0027A young boy, aged about eight-years-old, was also photographed clambering over rocks underneath the crumbling cliff-face with no parents in sight.Mr Hunt said: \u0027Watching the boy clambering over unstable rocks was truly shocking.\u0027Somebody should have been keeping an eye on him but if his parents were there you couldn\u0027t see them.\u0027          A young boy, aged about eight-years-old, was also photographed clambering over rocks underneath the crumbling cliff-face with no parents in sightThe photos were taken at 3pm yesterday on one of the busiest days of the year at the beach.Mr Lanning, of West Bay coastguard, said: \u0027The Jurrasic Coast is a beautiful place to come and visit, but it is also an ever changing and dynamic natural environment.\u0027Coastal erosion that can cause rockfalls, landslides and mudslides is a natural part of this environment, and these can happen at any time and without warning.\u0027The truth is that we just don\u0027t know when the next cliff fall might occur. It\u0027s the unpredictability of these dangers which poses the greatest risk to the public, but there are some really simple things you can do to keep you and your family safe.\u0027There is very clear signage on the beach and at the base of the cliffs which clearly states \u0027Danger Rockfalls, Keep Clear of Cliffs, Serious Risk of Injury or Death\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/22/16/4E7D4AA100000578-0-image-a-44_1532272108632.jpg","title":"Temperatures reach record high Japanese heatwave continues","story":"Japan has recorded its highest temperature since records began with the mercury hitting 106F (41.1C) in a deadly heatwave that has so far claimed more than 40 lives.

Some experts, he added, \u0027warn that complete and verified denuclearization could take 15 years.\u0027So after the head-spinning events and reversals of the past six months, it may now be time to dig in for a long wait.To some observers, moreover, the loss of momentum that Singapore should have provided is worrying. There have been few if any real advances.Even the North\u0027s return to the US of the remains of American soldiers killed in the Korean War (1950-53), described as \u0027immediate\u0027 on June 12, appears more complicated - with Pompeo now saying it may take place in \u0027the next couple of weeks.\u0027For now, the only concrete results of the Washington-Pyongyang thaw are the North\u0027s halt to nuclear and missile testing and the American side\u0027s suspension of planned military maneuvers with South Korea, long denounced as a \u0027provocation\u0027 by Pyongyang.The US had long rejected such a \u0027double freeze.\u0027 It involves gestures that could be reversed in a moment.\u0027If our goal still is the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of the North Korean nuclear program, we\u0027re not succeeding,\u0027 said Sue Mi Terry of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, speaking to a security conference in Aspen, Colorado.\u0027Not only are they not giving up their nuclear weapons program,\u0027 she continued, \u0027they\u0027ve been working overtime on advancing their program.\u0027The Trump administration, criticized for failing to obtain a written promise of this key objective in Singapore, now insists negotiations are progressing toward the North\u0027s \u0027final, fully verified\u0027 denuclearization. But a Pompeo visit to North Korea in early July was \u0027by all accounts except his own deeply disappointing,\u0027 said Jeffrey Bader and Ryan Hass in an article for the Brookings Institution. The problem, say the two experts, is that in Singapore, \u0027Trump gave away much of that leverage\u0027 to ensure the North\u0027s cooperation.And now the international campaign of \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 on Pyongyang - the stringent sanctions and the diplomatic isolation that Washington helped orchestrate - is beginning to weaken.\u0027The sanctions are already loosening,\u0027 said Terry, \u0027because China is not really implementing\u0027 them.Hence Pompeo\u0027s visit to the UN on Friday to condemn the erosion of the sanctions regime and to demand that the international community maintain serious pressure.But this could be a challenge, experts say. \u0027Maximum pressure\u0027 will be difficult to maintain in the absence of some new North Korean provocation.\u0027In case it doesn\u0027t work, we need to have a plan,\u0027 Terry said. \u0027We don\u0027t really have a Plan B.\u0027 North Korea wants US to make \u0027bold move\u0027 towards peace before denuclearization: source - CNNPolitics"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/23/4E0BEAC200000578-0-image-m-8_1531089627273.jpg","title":"Terrified dog forces emergency landing Moscow opening luggage hatch","story":"    Dogs often travel in the cargo hold on passenger flights, but in this case the animal managed to get out of its cage and in amongst the baggage, where it tore the inner lining and opened the front half-door (file photo)This triggered the emergency alarm above, while the plane was at an altitude of 13,000 feet and approaching the Russian capital.The commander of the Boeing 737, which took off from St. Petersburg, was forced to alert the ground services to the situation and perform an emergency landing, RT reported. A source at Moscow\u0027s Sheremetyevo Airport said that in its desperation to escape the dog \u0027tore the inner lining of the luggage compartment and somehow provoked the opening of its front half-door.\u0027Plane as day!

Some pictures are best left to the imagination.\u0027          The 180-million-year sandstone cliffs are prone to regular and sudden rockfalls, especially after periods of prolonged dry weather.Shocked photographer Graham Hunt was on the beach when he saw the woman perched on the cliff top. He said: \u0027You just don\u0027t expect somebody to do that, especially off 150ft cliffs which are crumbling and brittle because of the recent hot weather.\u0027There are frequent rockfalls there and one wrong step could have ended in tragedy.\u0027It was a case of holiday madness with people wanting to get selfies on the Broadchurch cliffs.\u0027A young boy, aged about eight-years-old, was also photographed clambering over rocks underneath the crumbling cliff-face with no parents in sight.Mr Hunt said: \u0027Watching the boy clambering over unstable rocks was truly shocking.\u0027Somebody should have been keeping an eye on him but if his parents were there you couldn\u0027t see them.\u0027          A young boy, aged about eight-years-old, was also photographed clambering over rocks underneath the crumbling cliff-face with no parents in sightThe photos were taken at 3pm yesterday on one of the busiest days of the year at the beach.Mr Lanning, of West Bay coastguard, said: \u0027The Jurrasic Coast is a beautiful place to come and visit, but it is also an ever changing and dynamic natural environment.\u0027Coastal erosion that can cause rockfalls, landslides and mudslides is a natural part of this environment, and these can happen at any time and without warning.\u0027The truth is that we just don\u0027t know when the next cliff fall might occur.

And what better image to capture that moment of explosive joy on the last day of term than this chaotic and colourful image by French photographer Aurore Valade, a graduate of the elite Beaux-Arts school in Bordeaux.Valade, whose work is one of the official exhibitions at the international Rencontres d’Arles this summer, seeks to examine the idea of liberation, transgression and revolt.This 2010 picture, from the series We were bored…, features a class of 13- and 14-year-olds at a school in the Yonne region south-east of Paris.Valade, 37, says she asked the teenagers what they would secretly like to do when bored, but did not dare because it was not allowed. When most admitted they wanted to throw something, she suggested they bring in a selection of harmless projectiles, including old pens and stuffed toys.“I like to work collaboratively, so I wanted them to choose the objects they would like to throw, then got them to throw them at the same time,” says Valade. “I wanted to capture this sudden and out-of-the-ordinary burst of adolescent energy. It was about exploding, expressing and exploring something in themselves. The idea was for them to revolt to do something unexpected, especially in a space like a school that is normally strictly controlled.“Suddenly, all is possible...including transgression and private rebellion.”More artistic than documentary, the photographs in the series – in this case a collage of three separate images – were meticulously staged. Valade says by amplifying the excessive energy of the pupils’ actions the pictures become “quasi-fictional”.This image epitomises the end-of-term euphoria many British youngsters must be feeling this weekend as the summer holidays begin.

Would they ever go home?At every West Indian christening, wedding or funeral that I attended in 1970s Luton, when the big people gathered for “some old time talk”, you’d inevitably overhear snatches of the same mantra: “Bwoi, this country too cold to bury. Don’t mek me bury here.” Men and women voiced a version of the same desire to turn back towards the West Indies, to “wheel and come again” as Jamaicans say. And when the time came, their burial back home would be done with style: “Yes, man, pure excitement!”Throughout my childhood my parents Ethlyn and Bageye seemed to live irritably in a state of temporariness, neither able to leave England nor return to Jamaica. I often wondered how they reconciled themselves to that condition. Is it ever possible to wake from that suspended state?The exodus of the Windrush generation from their islands was perhaps the final iteration of the great Caribbean migrations. The region had been exporting young adults for more than a century. In Dying to Better Themselves, Olive Senior conjures the extraordinary dangers faced by West Indians who comprised the bulk of the workforce for the construction of the Panama Canal in the early 20th century. Thousands died from tropical diseases, misfired dynamite explosions and mudslides. But the risks were offset by financial rewards, displayed ostentatiously by the returnees, the so-called “Colón Men” who left their islands with cardboard suitcases and returned wearing the best cut suits.Their seasonal work in Florida or Cuba was manageable, but the relationship between work and travel became far more complicated when employment meant travelling more than 4,000 miles to Britain.The forced and premature return of some Caribbean people, children of the Windrush generation wrongly identified as illegal immigrants in Britain, has interrupted an unspoken narrative: you left the West Indies poor but are expected to return wealthy. The sense of shame for some of the involuntarily “repatriated” has been overwhelming. When, inexplicably, 68-year-old Londoner Ken Morgan’s British passport was taken from him in Jamaica following his visit for a funeral, he found himself trapped on the island, 30 years after he had first emigrated. Acutely embarrassed by his poverty-stricken circumstances, Morgan tried to find work in Jamaica that didn’t require him to speak and betray his London accent.Ethlyn experienced similar worries when I convinced her to travel back to Jamaica with me for the first time in 40 years. I suspect now that it wasn’t just the expense that had prevented her visiting before, but the fear of what she would find on attempting to step back into her past.The genteel residential area of Kingston, where my mother was born bore little resemblance to 1970s Luton where we lived. Our utilitarian council house, a stone’s throw from the M1, had no veranda or music room there was no servant’s quarter and no uniformed maid the sky was low and the sun rarely shined, or so she felt. “Who tell me to come to this little kiss-me-arse place?” she would ask.Such sentiments were commonplace. In The Pleasures of Exile, George Lamming, who found himself on the same ship as Trinidad-born fledgling writer Sam Selvon when he travelled to England, recalls how Selvon voiced doubts as the ship edged towards its destination. Driven from the deck by the punishing wind, he mused: “Is who send we up in this place?”In quieter moments Ethlyn would admit to having made two profound mistakes in life: the first was to marry our father, the gambler Bageye the second was to follow him to England. But though my parents warred over many things, they shared the assumption that at least in the UK there were opportunities to work, save and prosper (to “work some money”) to enable their return. “Don’t get too comfortable,” Bageye would warn us kids. “We’re only passing through.” We had intended to stay for a maximum of five years, but the five years turned to 10. One day Ethlyn and Bageye started to change the wallpaper and, though nothing was said, we knew we were here to stay.Still, there were ways of maintaining the illusion of temporary exile. As the artist Michael McMillan has shown, West Indian migrants were expert at coping with the fantasy of return. They drew comfort from nostalgia when decorating their homes. In his tender 2009 exhibition, The West Indian Front Room, McMillan showed how bowls of plastic fruit, ice buckets shaped like pineapples, and listening to Jim Reeves’s “Welcome to My World” on Sunday afternoons were attempts in part to recreate the Caribbean in England. And if that didn’t convince, there was always the imported Jamaican newspaper, the Gleaner.Ethlyn kept alive her dream of going back through her subscription to the paper. On its back page, it carried adverts for plots of land in Jamaica and artists’ impressions of the houses that could be built there. Every Friday following her shift at Vauxhall Motors, she would take a pen and, after the kind of deliberation usually reserved for filling out the football pools, carefully circle the advert that seemed most attractive. Here, then, was proof that we would return. But the land was never bought, the house never built.My parents’ sentiments matched that of Moses in Selvon’s The Lonely Londoners who feels his life has stalled in Britain: “He could see a great aimlessness, a great restless swaying movement that leave you standing in the same spot.” And though West Indians had “Right of Abode” stamped in their British passports, it couldn’t prevent the sapping effect of nostalgia – an emotion poignantly rendered by the Trinidadian poet Roger Robinson in “Month One”: “He kept his suitcase full of clothes in the cupboard to stop it flying back by itself. He never actually unpacked.”Ethlyn and Bageye became increasingly detached from England they gave the impression of being marooned here. In the late 1960s and 70s, following every tabloid pronouncement that made clear we were not welcome in the UK, my father would resurrect the possibility of our leaving. Evidently Lamming felt the same, though the disengagement of the great West Indian author was more gradual. The first warning sign for him was the diminishing charm of London’s parks. The English had been unwelcoming in the past but were now “more hysterical in their response to strangers”, he wrote. Lamming dreamed of returning to Barbados: “And the dream was for me the foundation of all reality. I decided to go home and stay there.”The imagined delight of return infuses the short story “A Little Something” by the Trinidadian author Lawrence Scott. An exiled Trinidadian is drawn to a stranger by his accent, recognising him as a compatriot. At the end of their exalted remembrances he announces that he’s going back home. The stranger is surprised that it’s possible “to live” back in the West Indies but the protagonist banishes all doubts:I knew that on returning, when the runway came up ahead, my heart would break with the crank of the wheels being let down, and then with the thud as we landed at Piarco. “Live? Yes man, live!”Decades after Lamming returned to Barbados, Ethlyn too returned to Jamaica, though just for a visit. Driving from Montego Bay to Kingston we stopped at a place called Middle Quarters. It appeared to be little more than a large roundabout no traffic lights nor road signs and just a few huts. No sooner had we shut off the engine than a dozen “higgler women” (street sellers) carrying plastic washing-up bowls filled with crayfish descended, jockeying to sell us something we did not want. Eventually, we squeezed out of the hire car, pushed past the higglers and bought a soft drink at a shack a familiar voice called my mother’s name from behind us. We turned to see Brother Williams, a neighbour from Luton we hadn’t seen in more than a decade. After the excitement and tears we asked him what he was doing at this unlikely spot. He beckoned his wife, sheltering in the shade of a tree by a car, to join us. She paused.“Well it’s funny about it,” said Brother Williams, “but, Sister Williams, she wanted to come down to the square here to do a little selling.” Reluctantly, his wife shuffled towards us. “She has some clothes she would like to sell, and so we come along today, so it really was a surprise to see you and I think it is a good day.”In half an hour we were back on the road. I could see Ethlyn had been disturbed by the encounter. Why were this man and his wife, who must have left England with reasonable pensions, reduced to selling clothes at the side of the street? There were more disturbances over the next two weeks, and yet my mother seemed changed every day of our sojourn in Jamaica. She was quick-witted with all of the Jamaicans we came across. She moved in a much more relaxed and confident fashion than she ever had done in Luton, as if she was refamiliarising herself with her body. To travel with her was to see up close someone in recovery, who by the end had undergone a remarkable transformation. Though I didn’t broach the subject, we both knew what she’d often been thinking: “If only I hadn’t gone to England but remained in Jamaica imagine how I’d have shined and realised fully my potential.”In the late 60s, the psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross mapped out five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. It seems a pertinent model for considering the experience of West Indians at that time in Britain. What Ethlyn and her Windrush pioneers were suffering from was a kind of grief, a sense of loss and breach of youthful pledges made to themselves.“I’m looking about a piece of land which I’m going to buy,” said Ethlyn as we prepared to board the plane back to Heathrow. “There hasn’t been any happiness in England. Real, real happiness? No. I’ll be coming home to Jamaica!”But my mother, now in her 80s, continues to live in a transient state. She did not “wheel and come again”. Ethlyn sympathises with the pioneers ensnared in the Windrush scandal who yearn to bring to an end the uncertainty of not belonging. Asserting his right to his British passport, Ken Morgan rejects the compensatory offer of a visa: “If the British don’t want to give me back the passport, then they can keep it!” Morgan prefers to remain in a place that he can unambiguously call home. Maybe one day Ethlyn will join him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe4446b850045919f7b526459dabb527af5f2198/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4edc4e2b568ee1795fd9fd29c537aa60","title":"barclays create jobs glasgow tech hub buchanan wharf","story":"‘Transformational’ Buchanan Wharf campus could double bank’s workforce in ScotlandBarclays has announced plans to create up to 2,500 jobs in Glasgow.The bank is developing a campus in Buchanan Wharf to provide a base for its functions, technology and operations teams.Paul Compton, the chief operating officer, said the development was a flagship project.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the initiative would be “transformational” for Glasgow.The bank has agreed to buy the Buchanan Wharf campus development from Drum Property Group and the pair are collaborating to finalise the design.Barclays said the campus on the banks of the river Clyde would play a pivotal role in its long-term strategic priorities and would be one of a small number of key global sites.The hub will be able to accommodate up to 2,500 additional roles, doubling Barclays’ workforce in Scotland and making the bank one of Glasgow’s biggest commercial employers.Sturgeon said: “The new campus will strengthen Glasgow’s financial services sector and shows Scotland continues to be a highly attractive location for inward investment.“I am particularly pleased that as part of this investment, Barclays has committed to employing local people who often face barriers into work, including those with disabilities and young people.”Compton said: “The Glasgow campus, alongside others in Whippany in New Jersey and Pune in India, is part of a global strategy to create world-class facilities for our functions, technology and operations teams.“This new campus at Buchanan Wharf is a flagship project for the bank, which builds on Barclays’ long history in Scotland and clearly demonstrates our commitment to supporting the UK economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79b467ae8d4f342a4e3753872d67f3ccc6d19b35/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d84fbef540571fe280957ff98c639cd5","title":"quorn invests 7m r and d veganism boom","story":"The vegan food boom has prompted one of Britain’s biggest names in meat-free food to make a multimillion-pound investment in R\u0026ampD.

Attracted by the blinding floodlights, thousands upon thousands of migrating Silver Y moths descended into the empty arena. Those not killed by the heat of the lamps eventually ended up among the grass of the playing surface, where, after the lights were turned off, they hid throughout the day of the big match.As evening fell, 80,000 spectators took their seats and the lights were turned back on. The sleeping moths stirred, and soon thousands were zigzagging among the players. Photographs taken that night show annoyed football officials picking moths off each other’s suits, while the swarm blocked the lenses of TV cameras and hung from the goalposts. Perhaps the highlight came when Cristiano Ronaldo sat injured and weeping on the pitch, while a lone Silver Y sipped his teardrops away.As the Portuguese superstar had discovered, the mingling of urban development with the natural world can throw up some weird and wonderful occurrences. Cities are like mad scientists, creating their own crazy ecological concoctions by throwing all kinds of native and foreign elements into the urban melting pot, then spicing it up with artificial light, pollution, impervious surfaces and a host of other challenges. Researchers around the globe are documenting how globalisation and urbanisation are changing the behaviour and evolution of animals.Indeed, evolutionary biologists no longer need to travel to remote places like the Galápagos to discover their holy grail: speciation, the formation of new and distinct species in the course of evolution. The process is going on right in the very cities where they live and work. In tune with their human population, cities have been assembled from immigrants from around the globe. Either intentionally or accidentally, people have been ferrying flora and fauna across the world for as long as they have been trading and travelling. The ubiquitous Javan myna birds of Singapore first arrived as pets from Indonesia around 1925, sought after at the time as virtuoso impersonators. They now rival the human population in terms of numbers (and noise). The bright-green ring-necked parakeet, originally hailing from India and Africa, has established itself in European cities thanks to the caged-bird trade for much of the 20th century. In London, they feast on seeds of horse chestnut trees brought from Greece.Releasing 40 parakeets in 1974 “because Brussels could use some more colour”, the owner of a Belgian zoo singlehandedly founded the country’s entire population, now numbering some 30,000 birds. At the end of the 19th century, drug manufacturer Eugene Schieffelin decided to bring to the US every bird ever mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. In 1890 and 1891, he shipped 80 breeding pairs of European starlings (Henry IV Part 1) from England and released them in New York’s Central Park. Today, there are about as many starlings as there are people in North America.Our gardens, balconies and parks are stocked with plants from all over the world, which then provide food for a motley crew of animals from all continents. In Malaysian cities, European rock pigeons are ripping out the flower buds of Chinese hibiscus bushes planted along the pavements. In Perth, the Indian northern palm squirrel was released in 1898 and since then has maintained a healthy population thanks to the abundant fruits of African date palms and other exotic palm trees in the city. The urban loom weaves food webs from weft and warp that are thrown together by chance, linking species in new and exciting patterns.Places where human activity reaches fever pitch abound with exotic species. These urban ecosystems are formed not by ages of evolution or the slow colonisation by species under their own steam and of their own choice, but by human diligence alone. And that human urbanisation has had a sometimes surprising impact on the behaviour of animals.In the Japanese city of Sendai, the local carrion crows famously discovered how to use passing traffic as a nutcracker, dropping nuts among the wheels of slow-driving cars and picking up the flesh after the car had passed. For nearly a century in the UK, the milk bottle top-opening skills of tits – lively songbirds with a handsome pattern of yellow, black, and blue and olive-green – have been astounding and annoying city dwellers. Indeed, when manufacturers eventually introduced metal caps, the birds simply learned to hammer a hole in and then pull away the foil in strips.In Vienna, spiders have been observed to ignore their natural preference for the dark in favour of weaving their webs on sections of a bridge lit with fluorescent tubes. The spiders in the artificially lit “habitat” caught up to four times more prey in their webs than the ones that stayed in the dark. And when ornithologists in Mexico discovered an abundance of cigarette butts in the nests of house sparrows and finches, they were unsure why. Was it simply because the butts made the nests more comfy, or could the birds have noticed that nicotine – an anti-insect agent – could help to keep mites, fleas and lice at bay?The impact of cities is not just evident in the behaviour of animals – urbanisation has also changed the course of animal evolution.The shape of a bird’s wing is not something that evolution can mess with with impunity. It is very closely wedded to a bird’s way of life. Long pointed wings are better for fast flying in a straight line, while short rounded wings are good for making rapid turns or for quickly taking off.The conclusion was inescapable: only cliff swallows with wings short enough to take off vertically from the tarmac to escape an oncoming car had managed to get away and spread their short-wing genes in the gene pool. The tardier long-winged ones ended up as ex-swallows on the hard shoulder, their long-wing genes excluded from the pool. And, as the surviving swallows became ever better adapted at evading approaching vehicles, the number of casualties plummeted.It is precisely this quick-response benefit of more rounded wings that may be one of the reasons that the settler starlings evolved. In those 120 years since Schieffelin had released the starlings’ founding fathers in Central Park, the human population in western North America (the part of the continent that the starling expanded into) grew almost fifty-fold. What had been tiny settlements when the starling arrived blossomed into metropolises in a matter of decades. And with urbanisation came new dangers for urban birds: cats and cars. It is quite likely that this is what caused the American starlings to evolve a wing shape that helped them get out of the way of a pouncing cat or a speeding motorcar hurtling towards them.Cities have even begun to form new species, and for evidence we need look no further than Turdus merula, the blackbird – one of the world’s oldest and best studied urban animals.First, blackbirds began wintering in the city. Then, sometimes only many decades later, a few winter visitors stuck around for spring and eventually took up breeding with one another, gave up migration altogether and turned into resident city-birds, abandoning the forest.That’s about as much as one can glean from field guides and birders’ reports. To really get a feel for what makes the new urban blackbird different from its ancestral forest blackbird, we have to look at the work that an entire cottage industry of urban blackbird researchers has been doing over the past 20 years. In almost every European country, a team of biologists has stepped up and jointly built a veritable urban evolution fest around this one bird species. All this research seems to point in one direction: that the urban blackbird is evolving into a separate species, a case of true speciation.Across Europe and North Africa, city blackbirds have been found to have shorter, stubbier bills than forest blackbirds, presumably thanks to the easy pickings at bird feeders and other places in the cities where food can be had without pecking, probing or pincering. Whether it’s due to those different beaks is not sure yet, but urban blackbirds sound different too. The urban background noise forces the blackbird songsters to change their pitch and timing. As researchers in the Netherlands found out after recording almost 3,000 songs, urban blackbird concerts are performed at a higher pitch than forest ones, while a German research team discovered that, as foretold by Paul McCartney, urban blackbirds are singing in the dead of night. In the city centre of Leipzig, they start a full three hours before sunrise, well before the trams and cars start creating a racket. Forest blackbirds open their beaks only at dawn. They also start breeding earlier in the year than their sylvan relatives, as their biological clocks are advanced by more than a month.A second reason that the city blackbirds breed earlier is that they don’t migrate. They spend the winter in the city, leisurely picking food off feeding tables, and can start breeding when they feel like it. The forest blackbirds on the other hand are, by and large, migratory: to escape the cold and the scarcity of food, they spend the winter in the south and only when they return to their home ground can they begin breeding. By that time, the blackbirds in the city are already smugly ensconced in their nests.It is important to know that many of the differences were revealed in the laboratory, with forest and city blackbirds that had been reared as chicks under the exact same circumstances. So, they differ by nature (that is, genetically), rather than having learnt different modes of life. One could argue that over the past centuries, Turdus merula has spawned a new species, Turdus urbanicus, if you will. It’s not quite there yet, but it’s a matter of time for the process to be completed. The chances are that Turdus urbanicus will be the first in an ever-growing compendium of new species to have evolved in that new, expanding environment: the city. As things stand, cities are still a new phenomenon on Earth, and most urban animals and plants have only begun adapting to them for the past few centuries, millennia at the most. But if we can sustain our urbanised existence into the distant future (a big if), future generations might see the evolution of a unique and truly urban ecosystem.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a5f2341aa303b907c8563938621585a712e9352/0_881_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2680fd3d6bc0fd5047ce65c035100ec1","title":"excellent landlord tenants buy to let tips","story":"He’s been at it again. The poster boy for terrible landlords, Fergus Wilson, is being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for refusing to house and issuing notices to single mothers. This is the man who rejected people of colour as tenants, due to “the curry smell”.There are, however, many good reasons for more decent people to become landlords – including the sorry state of current pension provision. Given that our society relies on the private sector for housing, we need landlords. But we need good ones. So how, apart from not imitating the foul, sulphurous stench of Wilson’s prejudice, should landlords behave?Occasionally (and guiltily) friends ask me how to be good, not evil, knowing that I write about renting. Firstly, I steer them away from certain letting agents I know to be problematic. Then, apart from advising against illegal actions that would render them rogue landlords, I advise avoiding common sins such as unscheduled, random inspections, especially when tenants are out. Avoid greedy unwarranted rent rises, because encouraging good tenants to stay saves on bother and fees.And there are newer landlord sins to be avoided too. One friend, a resident landlord, lets his spare room, but recently shared on Facebook details of his flatmates’ loud sex life (note to Dan: unfollowing Facebook friends is like covering your eyes in the belief they can’t see you). Other irritations include canvassing neighbours. That’s right: visiting the wider locale to seek information on tenants’ conduct and private life, as happened to one person I’ve become aware of.Not being a bad landlord is actually easy, and boils down to this: being excellent. That is, kind and tolerant. I have some heartwarming tales of generous behaviour by former landlords, some of whom I am still friends with. One arrived uninvited to give us a bottle of booze for Christmas (sherry, but still, it’s the thought that counts). A friend’s landlord was calm when she called in a panic to say her toddler had scrawled on the wall, explaining that he would simply paint over the work of this emerging artist. Another former landlady urgently scheduled a meeting, which left us – her tenants – fearing imminent no-fault eviction. Happily, she explained that she was checking if we needed any repairs, while arranging to pay for cleaning the rambling house, which had been left in a mess, before encouraging us to decorate and saying she would compensate us for it. (She was just lovely, truth be told.)Landlords: your tenant is paying for your pension. Likely as not they won’t have one themselves. So be good, be kind, be professional. Don’t install a dangerous gas boiler, then refuse to repair it (I have so many stories …). Be like another landlord I recall fondly, who waited tolerantly for his rent while my compromised bank account was sorted out. Apart from accepting that life can be tricky and complicated, my top 10 tips for landlords are:1. Do repairs promptly.2. Don’t visit unannounced.3. Treat letting homes like a business, not as if you are graciously allowing strangers to stay in your home.4. Be mindful that human beings, not vermin, pay to live in your property.5. Provide good-quality fittings and furniture. 6. Do not store your own possessions in the property’s precious cupboard space.7. I shall say it again: let us decorate.8. If you are tolerant of occasional late payments, for example, tenants may not call at 2am on a Sunday demanding urgent hot water repairs, accepting that it takes a while to summon elusive plumbers.9. Don’t be creepy, expecting tenants to become mates, like the former landlord who was most put out when we rebuffed his offer to come round for “a smoke”.10. If you plan on selling up, inform your tenant first, not last, as has happened to myself and several friends.Above all else, don’t be ridiculously bigoted.

A darkened auditorium, an attentive, cult-like audience staring ahead expectantly, hardly daring to breathe a huge screen on which there is an image no one can decipher. And then, the person everyone has been waiting for strides confidently on to the spotlit stage, wearing a headset and carrying a PowerPoint remote, dressed immaculately and sporting a brand-new haircut. You can hear a pin drop as the presenter begins, “You think the world is round, but I am going to tell you to begin to believe it is actually square.”Predictable, false and embarrassing how I hate TED talks. And it’s not even because they’re named after a man. What I can’t abide is the way presenters pace around the stage, I hate the gravity with which they deliver their message, and being patronised by a smug, overconfident “thought leader” is pretty intolerable.I have friends who have done TED talks, and have respectfully watched their efforts. But one minute in, I start to look away, cringing. Why are they so popular? Why do tickets for spectators sell for thousands of dollars? How come some folk clamber to get on the TED circuit, despite not being paid a penny for the privilege?Those invited to be potential TED talkers are required to attend several auditions, and, if they are one of the chosen few, a number of rehearsals before they are deemed ready. I know one speaker who flew from London to New York just to audition to do TED, paying his own flight for the sheer privilege of performing a live advertorial and hopefully flogging a few books. The talks are so rehearsed that even the well-placed pauses and casual hair flicks look hideously false. TED-bots strut around the stage, posing, delivering well-crafted smiles and frowns. It’s like amateur dramatics for would-be intellectuals.Many of the speakers state the blatantly obvious on a loop, sounding as though they have discovered the theory of relativity all over again. The pretentious gestures, rehearsed pauses and speech traits single them out from other public speakers. They appear to have learned the art of making the simplest ideas appear complex.Let’s have a look at some of the topics tackled in these talks, only lightly paraphrased by me: “Why charity shops should replace posh designer shops”, “Why go fast when slow is better?” “Embracing openness and being yourself” (10,000 versions), “Schools kill creativity”, “Kids should teach themselves”, “How letting yourself be vulnerable, by someone about as vulnerable as Donald Trump, is the way to go”, “We have been tying our shoes wrong – here’s how to tie them right”, and my all-time favourite, “We are depressed because things are shit, therefore if things weren’t shit we wouldn’t be depressed, or need to take medication”.I often give talks to both small and large audiences, and always feel nervous beforehand. This used to bother me, after decades of public speaking, but I then realised that being nervous is respectful of those who are there to hear me. Why would anyone wish to listen to some overconfident, over-rehearsed guru? Why would I want to subject them to a performance?I am sure there are some great ideas to come out of some TED talks, but the style puts me off devouring the content. If you really want to tell millions of people why the chicken crossed the road, is it really that difficult to do it standing still with your hands in your pockets? Try it without the rehearsed wry smile, and the PowerPoint, and foregoing the strategically placed pauses. Maybe I could do a TED talk to show how it would work?• Julie Bindel is a freelance journalist and political activist, and a founder of Justice for Women"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43b038cdadc9fecac159d9dd2a78a83e3edd4f7d/0_6_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae98ab2c8299b87fc6a432bb20065449","title":"working mothers women in work children","story":"“Women work – but should they?” It’s a tough one. I mean, it must be, considering how variations of the question endure. This generation asks it, as did the one before it, and the one before that. Did the first consciousness, alone out there in the universe, find itself wondering “… but what about the children”?That contradiction won’t be surprising for mothers who still face a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” scenario for almost all aspects of parenthood. Breastfeed your child – just not  in public. It’s fine to have your baby sleep in the bed with you, but that makes you reckless – a baby should have its own crib. You don’t work? You’re making yourself financially dependent on someone else (if you have a “someone else”, that is) and letting your job skills deteriorate – that’s lazy. Oh, you went out to work? You deprived your child of the care it needed. If while reading this you’re asking yourself: but what about fathers? What about male care-givers? The answer many mothers would probably yell at you now is: exactly.Apparently, dads are irrelevant. That’s how it would appear, considering where the questions about who shouldn’t be leaving the kids to go to work are directed. The idea that care-giving just isn’t really part of the gig for a man endures to the point that men often aren’t even included as part of the equation. No matter how progressive we may think we are as a society regarding gender roles, the fact that “what about the kids?” is still largely a question for mums is a sign that something isn’t right.Not everyone who asks is a chauvinist. Sometimes the question is posed in scientific studies by academics. Going beyond “women are just good with kids, it’s biology” – there’s “Early Maternal Employment and Children’s Vocabulary and Inductive Reasoning Ability: A Dynamic Approach” by Michael Kühhirt\u0026nbspand Markus Klein. The need for actual studies on whether a mum working has a negative impact on the cognitive development of her childr may seem horrifying, but doesn’t it make sense? Women’s voices talking about lived experience hasn’t been enough to answer “Women with kids work – but should they?”. An empirical study carried out by learned men, though? That will do it. That usually does.“When it comes to the cognitive measures under study here, we found no evidence of harmful effects on the children of working mothers,” says Kühhirt. “Exactly,” say the working mothers I know. It’s nice to have facts and figures to back up assertions. It shuts down those who don’t listen to women. But printing out the study and carrying it around to point at shouldn’t be necessary. If an academic study is what it takes for you to take on the idea that yes, it is OK for mothers to work, ask yourself why that is – why working mothers themselves saying this, over and over again, wasn’t enough?• Phoebe-Jane Boyd is a freelance journalist who writes on politics and pop culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9459756478f7cdd6cc74168386e779759a65158/697_764_4487_2692/master/4487.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86058e54703d1539aba2106d165151a6","title":"earths resources consumed in ever greater destructive volumes","story":"Study says the date by which we consume a year’s worth of resources is arriving fasterHumanity is devouring our planet’s resources in increasingly destructive volumes, according to a new study that reveals we have consumed a year’s worth of carbon, food, water, fibre, land and timber in a record 212 days.As a result, the Earth Overshoot Day – which marks the point at which consumption exceeds the capacity of nature to regenerate – has moved forward two days to 1 August, the earliest date ever recorded.To maintain our current appetite for resources, we would need the equivalent of 1.7 Earths, according to Global Footprint Network, an international research organisation that makes an annual assessment of how far humankind is falling into ecological debt.The overshoot began in the 1970s, when rising populations and increasing average demands pushed consumption beyond a sustainable level. Since then, the day at which humanity has busted its annual planetary budget has moved forward.Thirty years ago, the overshoot was on 15 October. Twenty years ago, 30 September. Ten years ago, 15 August. There was a brief slowdown, but the pace has picked back up in the past two years. On current trends, next year could mark the first time, the planet’s budget is busted in July.While ever greater food production, mineral extraction, forest clearance and fossil-fuel burning bring short-term (and unequally distributed) lifestyle gains, the long-term consequences are increasingly apparent in terms of soil erosion, water shortages and climate disruption.The day of reckoning is moving nearer, according to Mathis Wackernagel, chief executive and co-founder of Global Footprint Network.“Our current economies are running a Ponzi scheme with our planet,” he said. “We are borrowing the Earth’s future resources to operate our economies in the present. Like any Ponzi scheme, this works for some time. But as nations, companies, or households dig themselves deeper and deeper into debt, they eventually fall apart.” In the past, economic slowdowns – which tend to reduce energy consumption – have also shifted the ecological budget in a positive direction. The 2007-08 financial crisis saw the date push back by five days. Recessions in the 90s and 80s also lifted some of the pressure, as did the oil shock of the mid 1970s. But the overall trend is of costs increasingly being paid by planetary support systems. Separate scientific studies over the past year has revealed a third of land is now acutely degraded, while tropical forests have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Scientists have also raised the alarm about increasingly erratic weather, particularly in the Arctic, and worrying declines in populations of bees and other insect pollinators, which are essential for crops.

Incentives to use cheaper charging could include energy tariffs that offered cheaper electricity at certain times, such as when solar and wind power are generating larger amounts of power, or when demand is low.Such an approach requires homes to be fitted with smart meters, which are in 10m households but whose rollout has been slow.The regulator admitted it was not yet clear how such a fee would be applied, or how much it would be, as its work was at an early stage.As a last resort, electric cars would have their charging interrupted if their demand on local power networks threatened outages to households. However, this is only expected to occur in extreme cases.As part of the reforms, Ofgem is proposing that power grid owners should offer “off-peak” connections to the grid to avoid the cost of reinforcing networks. That could benefit the operator of a fleet of electric vehicles, if they could be flexible over when they powered their cars, as they would pay less in network charges than for a conventional “anytime” connection.Jonathan Brearley, the executive director, systems and networks at Ofgem, said: “Ofgem is working with the government to support the electric vehicle revolution in Britain, which can bring big benefits to consumers. Our reforms will help more users charge their electric vehicles and save them money.”National Grid recently revised upwards its projections for the take-up of electric vehicles and said it expects 11m electric vehicles by 2030, 2m more than it thought only a year ago. By 2040 it expects 36m electric vehicles.The company has also stressed the need for cars to be charged smartly, which it believes could limit the increase in peak electricity demand to 8GW, or about two and a half times the capacity of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station.Last week a new law was passed in parliament that will require anyone installing an electric charge point to make it capable of smart charging."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbf7290d3c943547eee5f58a30b5f5879420b15b/0_104_5197_3117/master/5197.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d144233e7572253f78a4a1516f62770","title":"garden photographer of the year macro winners in pictures","story":"International photographic competition, which runs in association with the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, London, awards special prize for the best close-up images"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e98da25520fda0dad777f8c2f5c6e399bee9ef7/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da58c736660b05fb48cbcb758c7059f0","title":"mamma mia why cant male actors sing","story":"As the new Mamma Mia! hits cinemas, we explore why male actors hit the bum notes in modern movie musicalsThere are many reasons why the first Mamma Mia! movie was such a smash hit, but we can all agree Pierce Brosnan’s singing was not one of them. He sounded like a labrador trapped under a blanket. Undeterred, judging by a clip of Hugh Skinner singing Waterloo in a style best described as “posh geography teacher whose necktie is too tight”, forthcoming sequel Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again looks set to be continue this tradition of masculine musical ineptitude.The Mamma Mia! enterprise hinges on a rarely acknowledged truth of modern movies: when it comes to actors singing, women are better at it. Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried and Lily James can hold a tune pretty well. It was a similar case with the Pitch Perfect movies. They hired Anna Kendrick and Hailee Steinfeld, both of whom have had bona fide hit songs. In earlier times, when musicals were a Hollywood conveyor belt, singing ability was a route to success, and performers would have paid their dues on stage or in vaudeville. However, today’s movie musicals must either cast genuine singers with limited acting ability, or genuine actors with limited singing ability. In the latter department, it is the men who come off worst.La La Land was a classic example. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling: fine actors, passable singers, but if you had to give one a recording contract, it would be Stone by a mile. Same with Enchanted: James Marsden does well Amy Adams knocks it out of the park. The Jungle Book? Bill Murray belts out The Bare Necessities Scarlett Johansson’s Trust in Me is velvety and sensuous. Richard Gere muddled through Chicago, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renée Zellweger pulled off their tunes with aplomb. Gerard Butler’s Phantom of the Opera sounded like a Britain’s Got Talent semi-finalist. Or look at Les Misérables: Anne Hathaway was fine Russell Crowe sounded like a man giving himself a hernia.Hugh Jackman is the exception that proves the rule. Jackman has anchored stage musicals and sell-out solo concerts, he’s that good. He really is The Greatest Showman, which isn’t saying much considering the competition.Time and again, it seems, male actors almost revel in their vocal ineptitude. Looking back, you wonder how on earth Richard Harris’s transcendently cheesy MacArthur Park could have become a chart hit in 1968. Likewise Lee Marvin’s throat-infection rendition of Wandrin’ Star (from Paint Your Wagon), a No 1 single in 1970. It kept the Beatles’ Let It Be off the top spot! And Rex Harrison didn’t bother singing at all and simply spoke his lyrics, yet still led smash-hit musicals such as My Fair Lady and Doctor Doolittle. His Fair Lady, Audrey Hepburn, was dubbed by a professional singer – a solution that does not seem to have occurred to today’s performers. It can’t be that men are naturally worse singers. Perhaps it’s more to do with the selection process that favours certain stereotypically “masculine” attributes in male actors, attributes that only overlap with singing ability once in a Hugh Jackman. Or perhaps the men feel they can get away with simply “having a go”? To his credit, Pierce Brosnan gamely accepted criticism of his performance in the first Mamma Mia! (which earned him a Razzie for worst supporting actor). But that hasn’t put him off having another try in the sequel. So here we go again indeed, although this time at least, he has been taking extra singing lessons.Mamma Mia!

She waited for her new husband on their new mattress in their new house while a joyful gang of young wedding guests filed in and out to take pictures of her on their phones.As is the tradition in Niger, the bride wasn’t invited to the ceremony so when Mohammed Yaou’s friends delivered him to her, carrying a ceremonial cloth over his head, it was the first time she had seen her new husband all day.A few months earlier Mohammed, a city boy, had come to their village on the green banks of the Niger river and asked her to marry him.He brought with him some suitcases full of new clothes and shoes, and 300,000 CFA (£400) in cash – the brideprice.“It was an unforgettable evening,” he said.The couple’s friends and siblings made a photo montage of the couple and the gifts, posting it on social media.“It’s to avoid any doubt,” Rakiatou said.In some parts of the world, a couple announce their betrothal with an engagement-ring selfie on Facebook. Among the urbanites of Niger, a pile of suitcases and a wad of money have become the equivalent. On heart-themed backgrounds peppered with kiss emojis these montages now fill Facebook feeds and WhatsApp groups across Niger. And, according to Nigerien women’s activists, they heap pressure on young women to get married too soon.Brideprice photos fill Samira Ousmane’s social media feeds. But the activist and founder of Nigerielles magazine lamented the fact that the money, formerly a secret between the couple and their immediate families and usually ranging between 50,000 and 15m CFA, has become something to show off about.“It creates a desire when you see others posting these kinds of photos and it pushes you to accept men you don’t love or when you’re not ready,” Ousmane said. “You don’t know anything about the guy but, because you see everyone else posting pictures with a brideprice of 2m CFA, you want it too you want to be married you want to be called madame rather than mademoiselle.”But technology is making it harder and is changing some aspects of dating and marriage.Facebook has been used as a dating service in Niger for years. Nigerien women receive hundreds of friend requests and messages from men who “drag” Facebook trying to pick up women and girls.Rabi Maikano met her husband on Facebook but the social network also nearly destroyed their relationship as after they were married he kept messaging other women, flirting with them and “liking” their pictures. They were on the verge of orce but Maikano salvaged the situation by defriending her husband.Divorce rates have soared because of social media, according to Niger’s most senior marabouts, or religious teachers. Every week they counsel unhappy couples and their number one piece of advice is for husband and wife not to have access to each other’s phones.“Twenty years ago the number of orces didn’t even reach the hundreds,” said Sheikh Djibril Karanta, sitting with three marabouts in white robes and gold watches in the Islamic association headquarters in the middle of a treeless clearing in Niamey.Last year, by contrast, 820 couples got a orce through the association. They lay the blame on Facebook and WhatsApp for making infidelity easy. “It’s not good. It’s against our religion. People are abandoning our culture for a foreign one and it’s all because of social media,” Karanta said, adding that women were more at fault than men. “Most of the time, the women are the problem. They watch TV series from abroad, and see how women earn money and are equal to men. But here in Niger men look after women and they are superior.”Indeed, Nigerien women are getting ideas beyond their traditional station. For one thing many feel increasingly empowered to make their own relationship choices. However, some things are not changing: men can and often do have up to four wives.Seven days after getting married Fati Boubacar’s “sister” – her husband’s senior wife – was making her life hell. The towering pile of pink suitcases from her brideprice picture were on top of the wardrobe but she was beginning to wonder whether she should repack them and if the 1m CFA (£1,350) brideprice she got was enough.“The furniture I brought with me was worth more than that,” she said, struggling to keep the tears in. “Polygamy is so hard. She insults me all the time. I never expected this. Sometimes I even think about orce.”The solution, according to some male religious leaders, is for women to ditch social media. “A good wife shouldn’t use Facebook,” said Serge Abdul Razak, a young marabout (Muslim holy man) with his own television programme who recently put out a broadcast entitled How to choose a beautiful wife. “She should delete her account when she gets married and change her WhatsApp number.”According to the marabouts, it is the wider changes that have given rise to the social media phenomenon that are really to blame.People think they have the right to do everything now, they say.Karanta added that 1,400 years ago the Prophet had written that there would be huge upheaval this was it, he said. “We saw it coming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/138787b11ac016d24798e1dc3fa621d7ebb98b2a/13_1_1272_763/master/1272.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05255d095f5912d0508d1b891976635e","title":"fluffed it the truth about build a bears day of mayhem","story":"The global company was once lauded for being ahead of the curve, so what was behind the ‘pay-your-age’ misjudgment that left scores of its little customers brokenhearted?Thursday 12 July should have been a red-letter day for thousands upon thousands of kids, and for their favourite shop, Build-A-Bear Workshop. The company had announced a pay-your-age promotion, so customers in the UK, US and Canada could come in to make their own teddies and pay just a fraction of the normal cost: instead of £52 for a top-of-the-range bear, a six-year-old would pay just £6. It sounded brilliant.What Build-A-Bear hadn’t factored in was the devotion of its young customers, and the unending human appetite for getting something cheap. Its shops were overwhelmed with huge queues wanting to take advantage. Police had to be called to help control the crowds outside the Leeds branch. Scores of shops had to close early thousands of people left without getting in. Even some of those who did left wildly disappointed: one parent told the BBC that she and her children queued for three and a half hours to get into the Derby branch, then spent another two hours waiting to get their bears stuffed: “When I look back I will probably think, ‘What have I done that for?’ – especially with what I will end up paying for parking,” she said. The next day’s headlines contained the words no executive wants to see describing their business: “chaos”, “carnage”, “fiasco”.You might have thought Build-A-Bear would take urgent action to ensure a different outcome when its US stores opened, hours later, but no. Ben Bigalke and his three-and-a-half-year-old daughter Astrid arrived at their local Build-A-Bear Workshop in Minnesota’s Mall of America at 9.30am – 3.30pm UK time, several hours into the day of disaster. “The area around the store was completely packed with ensconced, almost camped-out customers,” he tells me by email. “The line zigzagged through the mall’s first floor and wound its way entirely through the theme park in the centre of the mall to the other side of the mall. It seemed like a quarter-mile-long line, at least. We learned later that people began camping out at 6am and there were probably more than 500 people – maybe 1,000 – in line before the store even opened. We were nowhere near the store.”In Minnesota, despite what had already happened in the UK, the events came as a complete surprise to all concerned. The Build-A-Bear store staff didn’t tell customers about how long they might be waiting, or what was happening. “I asked a security guard what to expect and they said they were upset by the situation, saying it was unexpected and that they were not prepared or even forewarned that something like that could happen,” Bigalke says. “They didn’t have any information about how many hours we could be expected to stay in line for, and I feel like they should have known. There also should have been representatives from the store telling us what was happening and what to expect.”Pay-your-age was the first major disaster in Build-A-Bear’s 21-year history, during which time the company has usually been ahead of the game, both as a retailer and a mythmaker. It is rare that a shopping chain has an origin story – its US founder, Maxine Clark, had been shopping with a friend’s children when the little girl commented that they should make their own bears in the absence of anything new in the shops. A lightbulb went on in Clark’s head. Of course, it wasn’t quite as homespun as that: Clark was an experienced retail executive, who had worked for the May Co department store company and been president of Payless ShoeSource. She knew what she was doing.The first part of Clark’s genius – and it was genius – was to anticipate what was to prove the most important shopping development of the internet age before it was de rigueur: experiential retailing. In summer 1998 – a year after Clark set up her first Build-A-Bear Workshop in St Louis, Missouri – Harvard Business Review published Welcome to the Experience Economy, an influential essay that set out the path ahead. “From now on, leading-edge companies – whether they sell to consumers or businesses – will find that the next competitive battleground lies in staging experiences,” wrote its authors. “An experience is not an amorphous construct it is as real an offering as any service, good, or commodity … Businesses must deliberately design engaging experiences that command a fee. This transition from selling services to selling experiences will be no easier for established companies to undertake and weather than the last great economic shift, from the industrial to the service economy.”This was precisely Clark’s business plan. Build-A-Bear has an eight-step process: “Choose Me, Hear Me, Stuff Me, Stitch Me, Fluff Me, Dress Me, Name Me, and Take Me Home.” Everyone who buys from one of Build-A-Bear’s 361 stores or 102 franchised shops – in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Denmark and China – has the same experience. They choose an outer skin from more than 30 options they select a sound chip to go inside (it can be a prerecorded sound, or one they record themselves) they add in a small satin heart (the part of the process that is the most emotionally rewarding, or manipulative, depending on your point of view) they get it stuffed to “just the right amount of huggability” they get the bear sewn up, with a unique barcode for future online participation they get the fur fluffed they accessorise it with clothes and extras. They give it a name to be put on a birth certificate and “passport” (I know of one parent who always takes his children’s bear passport on business trips, in order to buy something from the local Build-A-Bear Workshop and get the passport stamped). Then they are given the bear in a special carrying case to take home.“I think they did something incredibly clever,” says Corin Birchall, founder of the retail consultancy Kerching. “You pick away at the corners and there’s not actually a lot to it. But it absolutely captured kids’ imaginations and turned this commodity into a tangibly valuable product. At all retailers across the world, as the internet makes the market more global, a retailer’s job is to add tangible value to their place in the sale journey. I can’t think of another retailer that has added more value to the process. It’s just incredible how well they can monetise something that seems intangible to an adult. They were ahead of the curve in doing that.”And, for kids, the intangible really is something magical. Nicola Hunt’s nine-year-old daughter, Jenna, has nine bears and the associated accessories – the bears are from parties and gifts, the accessories (where Build-A-Bear makes a huge chunk of its revenue) bought with birthday money. The number of accessories seems unending, all priced at what appears a reasonable level inidually, but capable of mounting up: £4.50 for a pair of bear sunglasses, £14 for a tent, £8 for a sleeping bag, £2 for a headband, and on and on and on.While Hunt feels disquiet at the hard sell given to parents, she admires the way the staff interact with children who visit the stores. “I like the actual process of choosing a bear, I like the way they put the heart in and you give it a kiss. But the bears are overpriced, the quality isn’t good and you can’t wash them.” Nevertheless, she has seen how important her bears have been to Jenna. “She was very unwell last year and in and out of hospital,” she says. “One of the things we did was go to Build-A-Bear and get a bear to go through the process with her. That was really helpful. When she had a drip in her arm, the Build-A-Bear had a drip in its arm. There was something very special about it.”The second part of Clark’s genius was choosing the teddy bear, a toy that has remained fundamentally unchanged since coming to the market 115 years ago. “The teddy bear has become an icon, a symbol of childhood, which is why campaigns aimed at children use the image of a bear – think of Pudsey,” says Deborah Jaffé, author of The History of Toys. “The teddy was the first really mass-produced soft toy. But it was just chance it was bear – it could have been a dog or a monkey. But a bear is a simple shape to make and doesn’t use much material. It’s not as complicated as, say, making an elephant.”They remain popular, Jaffé says, not just because of their simplicity and sweetness – and, truthfully, who does not love a nice teddy bear? – but because animals can stand in for humans in a universal way: bears have neither race nor gender. “You get this in children’s book illustrations: in order to get round gender stereotyping or race and ethnicity, it’s easy to use the animal rather than a human form. When you put a human form in, it gets much more complicated. Mattel have had to make Barbie in lots of ethnicities – but you don’t have to do that with an animal.”Clark had hit on the perfect combination: a universal product and a new way to sell it, and then to continue to sell. By registering each bear with a unique code before it leaves the store, Build-A-Bear gives its young customers the chance to continue participating – and spending – in the Build-A-Bear experience online once they get home: as well as buying yet more stuff, they can participate in Build-A-Bear’s world. “Our website lets children create virtual versions of themselves and their animals and interact with each other online,” Clark explained in 2013.Even before data was such a valuable commodity, Clark had created an idea that meant Build-A-Bear knew more about its customers’ tastes than most toy retailers. As its senior marketing manager for digital explained in 2015: “We’re looking at the data from a macro level to understand whether a particular product resonates with a girl who’s four years old or 12 years old, and as you market to the mother, how do you continue to tell the mother about additional pets or accessories and fashions? We’re starting to get into this from a digital perspective with our loyalty members where we have that type of data collection because they chose the option of us continuing to market to them on a one-to-one basis.”By the time Clark stepped down as CEO in 2013, the company had generated $5bn (£3.8bn) in sales. It also continued to expand its “experiential offering”. As Clark’s reign drew to a close, it was introducing “HyperSound directional audio technology” into some of its stores, which would let Build-A-Bear run multiple interactive kiosks within its shops, offering a specific audio message to customers. Directional audio is yet another of the techniques used by retailers to try to prolong time in-store and increase the amount they spend. Or, as the website Retail Customer Experience put it: “By using directional audio retailers can create an immersive 3D sound environment confined to a specific area … Those outside of the zone don’t hear the sound, and for the shopper the experience is similar to wearing headphones, except they aren’t wearing headphones … The memorable experience delivered via directional audio adds a ‘wow’ factor that increases the effectiveness of advertising messages, ultimately leading to increased sales.”Fearing kids were being lost to screens, it partnered with Samsung to place interactive stations in shops, so customers could build their bears without any of the burdensome physical or personal interaction of the traditional experience.But times aren’t necessarily easy for Build-A-Bear. It made a loss in 2013, when Clark left, before bouncing back into profit. Its 2017 annual report notes that total revenues have declined year-on-year since 2014 last year’s profits are little more than half its 2014 levels. The report admits one of the main contributors to a consolidated net income increase over the previous year was “an increase in gift card breakage revenue”. In short, a big chunk of its profit was down to kids accidentally snapping gift cards they’d been given, and being unable to redeem them.The pay-your-age promotion was meant to be the start of a new thrust. By making it open only to members of the Build-A-Bear Bonus Club, it hoped to entice scores of new customers to register. Doubtless they succeeded. Unfortunately, the offer they made was just too good. In the wake of the fiasco, a YouGov poll found that while awareness of the brand had rocketed, that awareness was almost entirely negative.And, as Birchall observes, the episode was entirely avoidable. First, he says, it is “quite alarming” how badly Build-A-Bear underestimated the level of demand. What’s more, the fact that the whole appeal of the shop is based on a time-consuming experience means it does not lend itself to events with acute peaks of traffic, rather than steady flows. “I can’t fathom how they could be that far out.”At this point, it would be apt to give the last word to Build-A-Bear. I sent them 15 questions, most of which were purely factual, and some specifically about the pay-your-age promotion. After due consideration, the company’s PR people sent back their response. “We greatly appreciate your interest in this story. We are still reviewing and analysing, so we’re not able to answer most of your questions at this time. That said, we did want to share the press release regarding the Build-A-Bear Count Your Candles program to ensure you had the full details on this program that launched last week.”So I go to Brent Cross shopping centre in north London, to the branch hidden away inside the Fenwick department store. There were no customers there on a warm Wednesday morning during term time. Can I speak to the manager, please? Yes, that’s me. Would you be willing to tell me what it was like to be in charge on the Thursday of pay-your-age? She looks panicked and says she has to call her boss. A couple of minutes later, she returns. “We’re not allowed to talk to anyone. No interviews.”At Build-A-Bear, the PR shutters are down. But the bears still sit there in their rows, waiting to be stuffed, fluffed, named and taken home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b94a4eaa41ef1a7a3b650be5e275759d9a7b0bd/0_559_8022_4815/master/8022.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d10bb1ab2b98b6109a03771600a116c","title":"rachel roddy recipe tomato risotto","story":"A good glug of red vermouth brings sharp sweetness to this simple, timeless classicAside from including one of the best descriptions of eating an orange I’ve read, A Time in Rome by the Irish writer Elizabeth Bowen is an evocative account of a city, its architecture, its atmosphere, its daily rhythms. Bowen finds the perfect words for “the utter blank” in the middle of the Roman day, “announced by the clanging down of black iron shutters, which before owners go off to lunch they stoop to lock”. Almost 60 years have passed since she wrote those lines, yet they still ring true, especially during the white-hot days of summer in Piazza Testaccio, when the ceremonious yanking down of shop shutters really does feel like the city is shutting its eyes for a nap.Depending on the shop and the heat, shutters and serrande are pulled back up between 4pm and 5.30pm and, gradually, people start returning to the piazza. Kids who have been cooped up in darkened rooms since lunchtime are like springs uncoiling, scooting, kicking balls or each other, while everyone else clusters around the two dozen benches and fixed iron tables that fringe the vast square. From utter blank to a hive of Roman life. Then, at about 6.30pm, when the sun is at a comfortable angle and the summery air cooler at the edges, there are the first sightings of luminous drinks.Undeterred by the fact they don’t have their own tables, the waiters at the bar run by two Neapolitan brothers have made the piazza their own. You have to go in to order at the counter, pointing in the vague direction of where you are sitting before being told to go back there. A few minutes later you will spot your order – a beer, a chinotto, a Fanta, a prosecco, a spritz luminous with orange Aperol or pink-red Campari, a Negroni, or an americano in a proper glass – balanced on a small round tray, being navigated around bambini and footballs across the piazza to you, soon followed by a small festa of crisps, peanuts, olives the size of small plums and various toasted sandwiches. These days, my piazza drink is an americano: equal parts Campari, Martini rosso and soda, or simply a Martini rosso on ice (lots). Some find this odd, as they consider Martini a mixer. I have not progressed much beyond the sips, taken as a nine-year-old at my gran’s pub, of what felt like the most exotic and racy drink, sweet, spiced and syrupy red, with enough ice to numb my lips.That Martini rosso is what I grab when I make tomato risotto, too, which – like my favoured piazza tipple – is not as odd as it may sound. It is a quirk taught to me by the same person who taught me his five steps of risotto, which have stuck in my memory like a rhyme. It is a template for endless variations. You add the vegetable, fish or meat depending on how much cooking it can handle. Tomatoes are also acidic, which is where the Martini comes in, lending that nip of sharp sweetness, tempered into dinner happiness by the butter and parmesan.1 small onion4 tbsp olive oil80g butterSalt and black pepper400g risotto rice (arborio or carnaroli)100ml white wine or 50ml martini rosso500g ripe tomatoes, skinned and chopped1.5-2 litres waterlight vegetable or chicken stock75g grated parmesanPeel and finely dice the onion. In a large, deep frying pan or casserole over a medium-low flame, fry the onion in the olive oil, half the butter and a pinch of salt, until soft and translucent. Put the wateror stock in a pan and bring to a simmer at the back of the stove.Add the rice to the onion and stir until every grain glistens, then add the wine or martini and stir while it evaporates. Add the tomatoes and another pinch of salt and stir.Now glance at the clock – this will take about 17 minutes. Begin adding the water or stock a ladleful at a time, stirring until it is absorbed before adding another. After about 14 minutes, start tasting: the risotto is ready when the rice is plump, but still al dente, meaning with a slight resistance but not chalky, with the consistency nice and moist, ready to absorb the butter and cheese at the next stage. You may or may not use all the liquid.Pull the risotto from the heat and leave it to rest for a minute, then beat in the second half of the butter, all the cheese and a few grinds of black pepper. Serve, passing around more cheese for those who want it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e5f08d8167c5fabaf61d8744d3fda06f0e6886d/0_629_5784_3472/master/5784.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4726084386c0dcc91b4a7f825e0b7f6b","title":"david bowies first demo track discovered in old bread basket","story":"Bowie, 16, was singing I Never Dreamed on tape, which was turned down by music firmLong before Aladdin Sane or Ziggy Stardust, a skinny 16-year-old with ambitions to be a saxophonist agreed to do lead vocals on a demo track, in a small studio in south London. Now the only known recording of the resulting session, with David Bowie singing I Never Dreamed with his first band, The Konrads, has resurfaced in an old bread basket, and is expected to fetch £10,000 at auction.The record company evidently failed to recognise the potential of the voice that would become one of the most famous of the 20th century. The Konrads did not win the longed-for audition with Decca, although the record company did give them a trial later that year – and turned them down – soon before Bowie left the band citing artistic differences.The tape was rediscovered by David Hadfield, who was slightly older than the other Konrads, and who was both their drummer and manager. He found it when moving home, stashed in an old bread basket that had belonged to his grandfather along with a host of other material including booking forms, photographs, promotional sketches, letters and bills, in a loft above the garage.Hadfield, who went on to make a career in the music industry, recalled that the Konrads’ agent, Eric Easton, who also managed another obscure young band called the Rolling Stones, asked them to make a demo, so he booked a session at RG Jones in Morden. Bowie, then David Jones, before he changed his name to avoid confusion with the Monkees’ teen idol Davy Jones, and a few other band members, including Alan Dodds who became a vicar, wrote some songs for the session. Hadfield recalled: “We had decided that we would do a couple of guitar instrumentals and one original song. I chose I Never Dreamed as it was the strongest, the other two were a bit weak. I also decided that David was the best person to sing it and give the right interpretation. So this became the very first recording of David Jones singing 55 years ago. “There is no other recording of the demo featuring David as lead in existence. Decca initially turned us down, but when they eventually gave us an audition later that year, vocalist Roger Ferris was the lead voice and David sang backing harmonies.” Bowie died of cancer in January 2016, two days after the release on his 69th birthday of his 25th studio album, Blackstar. The auction of his personal art collection, which included works by Frank Auerbach and Damien Hirst, raised £33m in a two-day sale at Sotheby’s – more than twice the pre-sale estimate.Hadfield’s memorabilia will be sold by Omega Auctions, in Newton-le-Willows on Merseyside, in September. Auctioneer Paul Fairweather called the tape “completely unique and of great historical interest, being the earliest studio recording of a fledgling musician who would go on to super stardom”.

She is now senior editor at radical leftwing website Novara Media, focusing on race, gender, class and power. Footage went viral last week after she appeared on ITV’s Good Morning Britain to discuss the Stop Trump march, telling presenter Piers Morgan: “I’m literally a communist, you idiot.”How is your newfound fame?Surreal. I’m punch-drunk but still alive. Before, I’d maybe get recognised a couple of times per week now it’s most places I go. What if I’m really hungover and gross one day? Or having a PMS cry on the bus? But everyone’s unerringly lovely and just wants to chat about politics, which is encouraging. It shows there’s a real desire for engagement and conversation that doesn’t treat people like they’re stupid.Do you think there’s a trend towards shouty, adversarial media?Yes, although there’s a huge contrast between Newsnight, where you can make a point clearly, and Good Morning Britain, where you’re entering a bear pit to get savaged. Piers Morgan and the production team have tacked quite hard towards the alt-right. A leftwing Muslim woman is like throwing chum to them.How did you feel when Piers Morgan kept talking over you?He kept trying to pin me down on Obama’s presidency, even though I’d come on to talk about Trump, with the presumption that I was a diehard Democrat. That’s when I lost my temper. I hadn’t planned to call him an idiot or go in hard about his journalistic record. I was just frustrated with being barracked for something I’m not.Have you had more TV offers?Celebrity Big Brother asked me to go on. I said, “Listen, there are much easier ways to see me get drunk, alienate people and have an ill-advised dry hump. Just find me on a Saturday night out.” I could become a tap-dancing poodle in the culture wars, but is that going to get more people participating in politics or just make me a discourse clown?Do you feel you should capitalise on your higher profile?It’s not about personally profiting I want people to support the media organisation I work for. Since Good Morning Britain, I’ve had lots of emails from weird men asking if I can “fin-dom” them – financially dominate them by spending all their money. It’s unsettling, so I’ve been replying with the link to our donations page. We’re selling “I’m literally a communist” T-shirts to help keep the studio running.It was also on placards at the Stop Trump march. How was that?I bumped into some of them. This is what people have been missing: politics shouldn’t be about the dour cultishness and pomposity that dominated the left for decades – it should be joyful and exuberant. Your Twitter bio uses the phrases “anarcho-fabulous” and “luxury communism”. Can you explain?It’s partly poking fun at how people accrue adjectives and put them in their bios as if they’re a meaningful badge. But also, my communism isn’t about authoritarian bureaucracy, suppressing freedom or everyone wearing burlap sacks. It’s about the desire to see the coercive structures of state dismantled, while also having fun. It’s not about driving everybody down to the same level of abjection, but making aesthetic pleasures and luxuries available to all.How do you envisage communism working in 21st-century Britain?As a long-termist, I acknowledge there are more pressing causes than the abolition of private property. This is why I’m a Corbyn supporter. We have the opportunity for a socialism that says austerity is a deliberate political choice. We can more equitably distribute wealth through taxation. We can borrow to invest in housing, railways and healthcare, making them publicly owned and managed assets. That’s what we’ve got room for in this country right now. Communist vision can help guide that and give people a say in every decision that affects their lives.Is it possible to support Corbyn but still feel betrayed by him over Brexit?I voted Remain but the cost of losing twice would be catastrophic. It would make life difficult for people of colour or anyone perceived as an immigrant. If you want any hope of staying in the EU, or having a Brexit that doesn’t mean capitulation to ethno-nationalism, you’ve got to tie it to a wider vision of political and economic transformation. Which, at this point, means backing Corbyn.You’re a big football fan, right?Huge. I’m a diehard Spurs supporter who gets her heart broken again and again. I love terrace culture, the flow of the game and those moments of beauty like Zidane’s volley where you just think: “That is God speaking through you, my son.” I became obsessed with Jordan Pickford during the World Cup.

Gurr reportedly issued the warning during a summit of business leaders hosted by Raab at Chevening, a Kent country house used by the government.Other business leaders attending included the Barclays chairman, Sir Ian Cheshire the chairman of the supermarket chain Morrisons, Andy Higginson the chief executive of Lloyd’s of London, Dame Inga Beale and the UK chair of Shell, Sinead Lynch.Amazon is among a number of businesses to warn about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, in which the UK leaves the EU without an agreement in place governing matters such as trade tariffs.Several major employers, including the aerospace giant Airbus and the UK’s largest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, have warned they could be forced to move jobs and investment overseas.The no-frills airline Ryanair said on Monday it believed there was a significant chance of a no-deal scenario.“We remain concerned by the danger of a hard (‘no-deal’) Brexit in March 2019,” the Dublin-based carrier said in a statement. “While there is a view that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented (and extended), recent events in the UK political sphere have added to this uncertainty and we believe that the risk of a hard Brexit is being underestimated.”Fresh anxiety among UK businesses emerged days after Raab accused Brussels of being irresponsible for flagging up the risks to EU nationals living in Britain from a no-deal Brexit.In an interview on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Raab described a document published by Brussels last week that highlighted the risk of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement as “obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure”.He also dismissed a Sun story saying the government was planning to stockpile processed food in case of a no-deal Brexit.He at first denied it, before adding: “That kind of selective snippet that makes it into the media, to the extent that the public pay attention to it, I think is unhelpful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bfba946b166e255f8a32236a4547a122ec26e89/255_46_3245_1948/master/3245.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f12c2eaa20b47abf8eb2956ef9142c0","title":"universal credit it system broken service centre whistleblowers say","story":"Service centre staff say glitches having harmful effect on huge number of claimantsUniversal credit is so riddled with design flaws and process faults that it is practically guaranteed to generate mistakes and delays that would push vulnerable benefit claimants into hardship, according to whistleblowers.Service centre workers have told the  that glitches and errors in the “cobbled-together” system have commonly led to claimants’ benefit payments being delayed for weeks or wrongly reduced by hundreds of pounds.One said: “The IT system on which universal credit is built is so fundamentally broken and poorly designed that it guarantees severe problems with claims.”He said the system was overcomplex and prone to errors that affected payments and often proved slow to correct. “In practical terms, it is not working the way it was intended and it is having an actively harmful effect on a huge number of claimants.” Universal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits (including unemployment and benefits, and tax credits) into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work.The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\u0026nbspmanagement failures, expensive\u0026nbspIT blunders and design faults\u0026nbsp means it is six years behind schedule and rollout will not be complete until 2023.The original design set out\u0026nbsp a\u0026nbspminimum 42-day wait for a first payment\u0026nbspto claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\u0026nbsprent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\u0026nbspnotable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\u0026nbspMinisters have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.Plenty.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMultibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\u0026nbspimposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It\u0027s also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.Mistakes and delays can add on average an extra three weeks to the formal 35-day wait for an initial benefit payment, pushing claimants into debt, rent arrears, and reliance on food banks. Campaigners warn that the problems could get worse next year when more than 3 million claimants start to be “migrated” to the new system.Growing concern over universal credit, which is six years behind schedule but will eventually handle £63bn of benefits going to 8 million people, is matched by disquiet over what critics say has been a defensive and insular approach to managing welfare reform by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).The department came under withering fire last week from a cross-party group of MPs who accused it of a “culture of indifference” after it had repeatedly ignored warnings of basic process errors that led to 70,000 disabled benefit claimants being underpaid an estimated £500m over six years. The work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, sought to limit the damage in a speech on Thursday in which she admitted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to listen to campaigners, claimants and frontline staff to find ways to change and improve the system.One whistleblower said many of the design problems with universal credit stemmed from the failure to understand claimants’ needs, especially where they lacked digital skills and internet access. “We are punishing claimants for not understanding a system that is not built with them in mind,” he said.The DWP said it would not comment on the whistleblowers’ specific claims but insisted the system was being constantly improved. “Universal credit is a flexible and responsive benefit and we continue to listen to feedback and make any necessary improvements during the rollout with our test-and-learn approach.Bayard Tarpley, 27, who left the Grimsby service centre last week after two years as a telephony agent, told the  that he had been dealing with distressed claimants every day. “My hope is that by speaking out I can help explain why these processes have such a significant, harmful impact on claimants.”To help us further understand the issue, we\u0027d like to hear from people who have experience working with universal credit claims or claimants.

Officials are told to advise claimants who are in hardship and who do not qualify for cash advances to contact charities or their council for help. Many councils have closed local welfare provision as a result of cuts. A second whistleblower, Joanne Huggins, who was until recently a case manager at the Grimsby centre, said that high staff caseloads and a high volume of calls to the service made it difficult to keep track of and prioritise claimants’ problems. “The system is set up in such a way that people don’t get support,” she said.At least £1.3bn has been spent since 2010 developing universal credit. Although it is heralded as a streamlined digital replacement for the existing benefit system, a recent National Audit Office report concluded it was still in many aspects unwieldy, inefficient and reliant on basic manual processes.The DWP says it operates a “test-and-learn” approach to constantly improve the system, although the whistleblower said in his experience staff suggestions were ignored and “top down” adjustments tended to follow media or political controversies, such as the scrapping of call charges on universal credit helplines.Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union that represents DWP staff, said: “The findings from the whistleblowers are in line with the ongoing feedback we get from our reps and members who struggle to deliver a service to universal credit claimants in the face of mounting cuts and increasing workloads.”Citizens Advice said its research showed that a “significant minority” of claimants faced additional waits for payment because of the complicated application process. The 10-stage process took some claimants over a week to complete, even with expert help.“Top of the government’s list should be simplifying the process and making sure adequate support is in place so that a claim can be completed as quickly as possible,” said the chief executive, Gillian Guy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bc95197fefc84949c1d5356da3f4285498f1ca2/0_116_4326_2595/master/4326.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d398cea12c056f85e494aa78c910a97f","title":"francesco molinari open champion tiger woods sporting","story":"• Italian was paired with former world No 1 in final round• Molinari completed last two rounds without dropping shotFrancesco Molinari said he felt a sense of disbelief after becoming the first Italian to win the Claret Jug, adding that the fact he achieved it while playing with Tiger Woods – who held the outright lead at seven under at one point – made it even more special.“I’ve played with him before in Ryder Cups and in big occasions, so I knew what was coming, and I was ready for it. I was calm – you know, as calm as you can be playing in the last round of a major close to the lead, playing with Tiger. I focused on my process and on hitting good shots and on playing smart golf.”The 35-year-old from Turin, who was inspired to become a golfer after watching Costantino Rocca on TV going close at the 1995 Open at St Andrews, said he hoped his win would have an inspirational effect on others back home. “The last round already was big news in Italy. Obviously, to achieve something like this is on another level. Hopefully, there were a lot of young kids watching on TV today, like I was watching Costantino coming so close. Hopefully they will get as inspired as I was at the time, watching him vie for the Claret Jug.“To look at the names on that Claret Jug, obviously, what can you say? It’s the best golfers in history and to be on there it’s incredible. From someone like me coming from Italy, not really a major golfing country, it’s been an incredible journey.”Molinari, who won with a total of eight under par, also said he was proud of his feat of managing to stay bogey free through the weekend, when the wind became more of a factor for what was his third win of the season and his first major title.“For the first time I felt I was ready for it. Winning at Wentworth and in the States,” said the Italian, whose triumph at Carnoustie forced him to cancel plans to leave Scotland on a 9pm Easyjet flight on Sunday. “Not many Europeans have managed to achieve that.Molinari also admitted he tends not to contest the Dunhill Links Championship in the autumn as he has been “beaten up” on the links at Carnoustie a few times. “I didn’t particularly enjoy that feeling. It’s a really tough course. You can try and play smart golf, but some shots you just have to hit it straight. There’s no way around it. You can’t really hide.”Reflecting on his final score of six under par, which gave him a share of second place, Rory McIlroy said: “I don’t leave here with regrets, I played a good tournament but this week is just wasn’t good enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55ea88e300ba5da3a754381738dd2af502d3dce0/232_0_3884_2330/master/3884.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53c455317ceea32ce366af8cbfab5b10","title":"county cricket lancashire v yorkshire notts v surrey and more live","story":"Jonny Bairstow and Harry Brook have shared the first fifty stand of this match in just six overs, advancing the score from 21-3, and they have now moved the score to 104-3 as Yorkshire reassert their authority on the Red Rose. Bairstow was dropped on 22 at mid-on by Matthew Parkinson off Graham Onions. No getting around it, he should have held on following a miscued punch. Brook has 48 and Bairstow 42. The lead is 187 as we approach the final half hour of the morning. Lancashire desperately need a wicket. Some lunchtime reading from Gary Naylor...Ben Stokes has claimed a five-wicket haul for Durham against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham, his first for the county in just over four years. Having claimed three yesterday, he has added the wickets of Chris Miles and Matt Taylor as the hosts moved to 362 all out.Jonny Bairstow and Harry Brook have just posted the first fifty stand of the match here at Old Trafford, in six overs, following the departure of Kane Williamson for one - caught behind off Graham Onions. Incidentally, Williamson’s return of one run in the match was a career low in matches which have seen him bat twice. Yorkshire back on track at 73-3, leading by 156. Rory Burns has reached his fourth hundred of the summer for Surrey as they plough on against Notts at Trent Bridge. He has lost partners Scott Borthwick and Aaron Finch to Luke Fletcher and Stuart Broad in the last couple of overs, but the Division One leaders are 246-3 after just 50 overs, leading by 36. Burns is unbeaten on 102 with Ben Foakes for company.Here, Jonny Bairstow and Harry Brook are counter-attacking with some effect. They have taken the score to 52-3, a lead of 135. Bairstow has 22 off nine balls and Brook is unbeaten on 20. Joe Root’s gone for three, caught behind off a beauty from Jimmy Anderson. Short of a length and Root was unsure whether to play forwards or back. Either way, he had to play at it and feathers behind to Dane Vilas. Yorkshire are 18-2 with a lead of 101. Elsewhere, Somerset have lost their last wicket against Worcestershire and are 337 all out at New Road. Here we go again....Lancashire have the breakthrough after 12 balls of day two.

Four times in a row now he’s been out offering no shot and can’t seem to buy a score.It’s been an incredible fall from grace since twin centuries in this fixture - a draw - towards the back end of the 2016 season, effectively earning him a Test call-up for the late winter series in India. He was supposed to be England’s opener for years to come, wasn’t he?Although there is a way this match could finish today, I fully expect Yorkshire to bat far better than they did yesterday and pile the pressure on Lancashire, who are set to be without Liam Livingstone (fractured left thumb) for the rest of the game. Livingstone suffered the blow to his left hand whilst fielding at second slip yesterday. He is out there on the field as I type, but with his lower arm in a cast. It is also a serious blow to the Red Rose’s T20 Blast hopes.The rest of Division One are going to have a job on to catch Surrey, that is for sure.They dominated the opening day against Notts at Trent Bridge, bowling their hosts out for 210 and replying with 223-1. Rory Burns is three away from a century. Stuart Broad has some bowling to do (0-38 from nine).Somerset are in reasonable health at 324-9 against Worcestershire at New Road thanks to half-centuries for James Hildreth, Tim Abell and Steven Davies against his former county.There’s the full complement of fixtures in Division Two, with leaders Warwickshire ahead against Middlesex (152-4 in reply to 236 and Will Rhodes unbeaten on 53) at Lord’s.Leicestershire have the upper hand at Kent, with their lead 45 with four wickets left having bowled the hosts out for 104 thanks to three apiece for Zak Chappell and Ben Raine.Gloucestershire’s Ryan Higgins, who has impressed with the ball this summer, performed with the bat as his 105 underpinned 315-7 against Durham at Cheltenham, while Northants are 74-3 replying to Derbyshire’s 260 all out at Queen’s Park, Chesterfield.Sussex are keeping the pressure on Warwickshire and Kent at the top and were bowled out for 327 by Glamorgan at Hove yesterday - Jason Gillespie’s current and former employers.Graham will be here soon.

It’s shallow and sordidOne of the most unpleasant rumours I can recall emerging from the Balkan wars of the 1990s was of a German agency who organised trips for tourists to “visit” the conflict and even participate. There’s nothing quite so appalling as that in David “Tickled” Farrier’s new Netflix series Dark Tourist, although it does venture into the grotesquely bizarre. He looks at the trend for Nuclear Tourism, for example, in which people flock to soak up the radiation left behind following the disaster in Fukushima, as well as the tourist industry that has built up around the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. He also visits locations in Africa and South America associated with death and destruction that some tourists find somehow attractive, a shameful attraction the makers of Dark Tourist assume is shared to a degree by the viewer.Although there are strong hints of Louis Theroux in Farrier’s chin-scratching demeanour, overall the series is part of a recent trend for making titillating TV from the world’s troublespots. Its soundtrack and graphics fit the bill: pummelling, Wagnerian motifs knocking you back like Tequila slammers, bursts of brutal fast cuts. It feels a little sordid, as if the miseries of the world are mere fodder for some televisual equivalent of the thrills of extreme mountain biking. On the other hand, you feel a bit chastened in your armchair watching Farrier enduring privations such as a voodoo ritual or narco tours in Pablo Escobar’s old neighbourhood.From The Misadventures Of Romesh Ranganathan to the range of documentaries produced by Vice (Uganda’s Moonshine Epidemic, The Cannibal Warlords Of Liberia, Nigeria’s Oil Pirates: The Curse Of Oil), there is a deep ambivalence about this particular strain of television. It’s educational, for sure, and takes some courage to produce but seems more interested in wallowing in the colourful weirdness of strife, as well as the ballsiness and endurance of facing up to it first hand, rather than offering any sort of political analysis or possible solution.A particularly egregious example, it always seemed, was Ross Kemp’s Extreme World featuring the former EastEnders hardman looking suitably engorged, challenging the world’s troublespots to come and have a go if they thought were hard enough. The credits were especially risible, bringing to mind Alan Partridge sitting on the toilet reading Andy McNab’s Bravo Two Zero. Once you got past the posturing and the “I was warned by the locals not to venture here but I’m a Mitchell brother, no one tells me where not to go”, he did actually succeed in exposing viewers to some bleak and brutal truths. In one episode, for instance, he investigated the phenomenon of sex trafficking in India, with thousands of girls abducted from country villages to big city brothels every year. He spoke to both the traffickers and to outraged villagers who were taking matters into their own hands. After all that initial posturing, you felt that Kemp himself shared a feeling of impotence in the face of such chronic evil, while the community response offered a sobering and genuinely strong measure of hope.Meanwhile, in Misadventures, when comedian Ranganathan visits Port-Au-Prince in Haiti, he has a moment of genuine doubt as to what he is doing there. The whole conceit of his stepping bravely out of his comfort zone (a motif of Dark Tourist also) suddenly seems cripplingly irrelevant in the face of the urban despair, while the wry, sidelong glance at the bonkers-ness of it all feels utterly inappropriate, too. “I’m not sure we should be filming here,” he says.Perhaps the master of this mode of television was Anthony Bourdain. In his series Parts Unknown, you never felt like you were being targeted by some amorally tumescent programme commissioner, seeking out macho thrills at the expense of the locals. When visiting Burma, for instance, he revealed its people not as global eccentrics, gun-toting desperadoes or basket cases for our entertainment but as human beings, conversing with them sympathetically, and inviting them to express themselves not through the varied and yet universal language of cuisine.

It’s a few days before I am – we are – due to start IVF injections. E is good at building things. Maybe it’s his love language.I don’t want a shelf, I say, I don’t want this to become a permanent part of our apartment!But I thought I was going to be in charge of organizing the medication, E says. (He’s also good at organizing things.)It’s true that this is what we’d agreed to, after our intro class, but now that I’m about to start treatment I don’t know what I want. I’m anxious and angry.Maybe not, I say, maybe I just want to do this all on my own! It’s my body!I know, E says, but how else can I be part of it?In the end, we compromise. I let him buy a large plastic box from the Container Store, I let him organize the boxes of medication and syringes and alcohol pads. He stacks the drugs that need to be kept cool in the fridge, next to the yogurt. When the time comes for the first injection, I am too afraid, and ask him to do it. E is kind enough to accept the job without mentioning my change of heart.This is the plan for my egg retrieval cycle: each evening E injects me in the stomach with two drugs. They pause my normal menstrual cycle and stimulate my ovaries to grow multiple egg-containing follicles to maturity. In the morning, I go to the hospital before work along with dozens of other women who are also having egg retrievals, some for IVF, like me. Some to freeze unfertilized eggs for future use. At the hospital the other women and I have blood drawn, to check our hormone levels, and we have transvaginal ultrasounds, to count the number of egg-containing follicles that are growing in our ovaries. The ultrasounds are invasive, but by the fifth or sixth day become routine. I ignore the feeling and scrutinize the screen as if I’m an aspirant sonographer. The doctors doing the ultrasounds take screenshots of the follicles. Each morning I feel like the count is not high enough, although I also don’t know exactly how many I should be aiming for. “You just need one” is something that people write in IVF forums online, to be encouraging. It’s technically true, but statistically unlikely.The benefit of having treatment in a large teaching hospital is access to great doctors and cutting-edge research. The drawback of having treatment in a large teaching hospital is that it is very crowded. One weekend morning I find that there is nowhere to sit in the waiting room because so many chairs are being occupied not just by the women who are being treated, but by their male partners who have accompanied them. I regard the men with rage while I, and several other women, lean against the wall. I text E, who is not there, because the hospital is an hour-long subway ride from where we live. It had not occurred to me that he should come along. If you were here, I write, you would not have a chair! I would not allow it!Of course not, he replies.The hormones are making me moody.They are also making me doughy. My jeans no longer fit comfortably and when I get home from the office in the evening I lie on the sofa and watch Sex and the City until 9.30, when E draws the drugs into the syringes and injects me again. A third drug is added, to stop me from ovulating too soon. I feel like a pallid, slow version of my former self. I can’t exercise, in case my swollen ovaries twist. I don’t want to see friends or go out to dinner or walk the dog.I go to an additional appointment to the doctor, a standard procedure to check my uterus for obstructions that could make it hard for me to get pregnant. Take some ibuprofen afterwards, the doctor advises, and I do, and I go to my office and am overcome an hour later by cramping so excruciating I assume this must be what it feels like to go into labor.After 10 days the follicles are large enough for the eggs to be retrieved. It is time for the trigger shot, which ripens all of the follicles at once so that they’re ready. E and I brace ourselves and he stabs the large needle into the flesh of my bum at the appointed time. It’s an act of love.Isn’t it funny, I say, that some people have sex to have children! We laugh.Thirty-six hours later, we return to the hospital for the retrieval. I will go under twilight anesthesia so that a doctor can pull the eggs out of my ovaries with another big needle. E will go into a small room with pornography to produce a semen sample. Our respective products will be combined by someone in a lab, to try to make embryos.The man in the queue for the small room behind E has the same first name as him. I hope they don’t mix your sperm up with Other E’s, I whisper to E.We’ll never know, he whispers back, that guy also looks like a Jew from New Jersey.Five days later we have the results. Eleven eggs were retrieved. But only two of them survive until the fifth day, which is how long they have to grow before they can be biopsied for the genetic testing, which is the whole reason we’re doing IVF in the first place.I’m sorry, the doctor says, when we have a call to discuss it. You can do another round next month.OK, I say.

They issued an appeal for international aid to help them tackle an epidemic of wildfires that has spread across the nation over the past few days.After months without rain, followed by weeks of soaring temperatures, the nation’s forests had become tinderboxes.The result was inevitable. Wildfires broke out and, by the end of last week, more than 50 forest blazes – a dozen inside the Arctic circle – had spread across Sweden.A nation famous for its cold and snow found itself unable to cope with the conflagrations taking place within its border and so made its appeal for international help, a request that has already been answered by Norway and Italy who have both sent airborne firefighting teams to help battle Sweden’s blazes.Nor is the nation’s fiery fate particularly unusual at present. Across much of the northern hemisphere, intense and prolonged heatwaves have triggered disruption and devastation as North America, the Arctic, northern Europe and Africa have sweltered in record-breaking temperatures. In Africa, a weather station at Ouargla, Algeria, in the Sahara desert, recorded a temperature of 51.3C, the highest reliable temperature ever recorded in Africa. In Japan, where temperatures have reached more than 40C, people were last week urged to take precautions after the death toll reached 30 with thousands more having sought hospital treatment for heat-related conditions. And in California increased use of air conditioning units, switched on to counter the scorching conditions there, has led to power shortages.But perhaps the strangest impact of the intense heat has been felt in Canada. It too has been gripped by ferocious heat, with Toronto recording temperatures that have exceeded 30C on 18 days so far this year. This figure compares with only nine such days all last summer.Dozens have died in the withering heat – with startling and grim consequences. Montreal’s morgue has been swamped with the bodies of those who have died because of the heat, and many corpses have had to be stored elsewhere in the city. Montreal coroner Jean Brochu said it was first time the city’s morgue had been overwhelmed this way.Britain’s scorching weather – which has melted the roof of Glasgow’s Science Centre and parched the lawns of the nation’s historic homes – may have made regular UK headlines. However, it has been relatively mild in impact compared to those experienced in many other parts of the world.Far from being a parochial problem, the current heatwave is clearly an issue that affects vast stretches of our planet: a global concern not a local one.But why is so much of our world currently being afflicted with blisteringly hot weather? What is driving the wildfires, the soaring temperatures and those melting rooftops? These are tricky questions to answer, such is the complex nature of the planet’s weather systems. Most scientists point to a number of factors with global warming being the most obvious candidate. Others warn that it would be wrong to overstate its role in the current heatwaves, however.“Yes, it is hard not to believe that climate change has to be playing a part in what is going on round the globe at present,” said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University. “There have been some remarkable extremes recorded in the past few weeks, after all. However, we should take care about overstating climate change’s influence for it is equally clear there are also other influences at work.”One of those other factors is the jet stream – a core of strong winds around five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface that blow from west to east and which steer weather around the globe. Sometimes, when they are intense, they bring storms. On other occasions, when they are weak, they bring very calm and settled days. And that is what is occurring at present.“The jet stream we are currently experiencing is extremely weak and, as a result, areas of atmospheric high pressure are lingering for long periods over the same place,” added Mitchell.Other factors involved in creating the meteorological conditions that have brought such heat to the northern hemisphere include substantial changes to sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. “These are part of a phenomenon known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation,” said Professor Adam Scaife, of the Met Office.“In fact, the situation is very like the one we had in 1976, when we had similar ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and an unchanging jet stream that left great areas of high pressure over many areas for long periods,” said Scaife.“And of course, that year we had one of the driest, sunniest and warmest summers in the UK in the 20th century.”However, there is one crucial difference between 1976 and today, added Professor Tim Osborn, director of research at the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia. “The baseline on which these effects operated is very different today. Since 1976 we have had several decades of global warming – caused by rising carbon emissions – which has raised baseline global temperatures significantly.”As a result, any phenomenon such as the weakening of the jet stream is going to have a more pronounced effect than it did 40 years ago.And as global carbon emissions continue to rise and predictions suggest the world will be unable to hold global temperature rises this century to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, widespread heatwaves are very likely to get worse and become more frequent, scientists warn.Nor is the problem of increasingly severe heatwaves confined to the land. “We have marine heatwaves as well – all over the globe,” said Michael Burrows, of the Scottish Marine Institute, Oban. “For example, there was a major marine heatwave that struck the coast of Australia last year. It devastated vast swathes of the Great Barrier Reef. More to the point, marine heatwaves are also becoming more and more frequent and intense, like those on land, and that is something else that we should be very worried about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b4173f5bbdd7e936983b3b94f6945415cd68f12/0_191_1333_799/master/1333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c06b15fb91b091791c1dd8fd7273ead","title":"belgian naturist beach plan blocked over subsidiary activities","story":"Wildlife agency says ‘subsidiary activities’ in the dunes would scare off rare larkThe Belgian Naturism Federation has come to the defence of its burgeoning membership after the Flemish wildlife agency blocked an application for a second nudist beach in the country on the grounds that bathers’ “subsidiary activities” would pose a threat to a rare bird.Attempts to gain designated naturist status for a quiet spot near Westende, about 12 miles south of the popular seaside resort of Ostende, hit a snag after objections were raised that sexual activity in the dunes would scare off the locally treasured crested lark, or Galerida cristata.The Flemish Agency for Nature and Woodland informed the region’s environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, that the lark, whose name derives from the feathers on its head that rise up during courtship, would be alarmed by the activity and would flee. The dunes themselves were also likely to be damaged by such “subsidiary activities”, the agency said in its formal submission.A subsequent suggestion that a fence could be established around the dunes where the birds breed was met with scepticism. Steve Vandeberghe, the local mayor in Bredene, where Belgium’s first and only nudist beach is located, told the Flemish daily newspaper Het Nieusblad that it would not offer much of a deterrence. “Barbed wire against nudists? Pff. As if a man without clothes cannot get over a barbed wire,” he said.Koen Meulemans, the chair of the Belgian Naturism Federation, said members frowned on the behaviour of some people who called themselves naturists. “We too regret this behaviour, which has nothing to do with naturism,” he said. “These are not real naturists for us.”Meulemans said the beach at Westende was perfect “as there is no building or sea dyke that looks out on to the beach”. The federation’s 8,200 paying members – up 600 on two years ago – needed a new beach because during the summer months “1,000 people face each other on a strip of 400 metres in Bredene,” he said.“After a long period of declining figures, we are now clearly growing. But those 8,200 are only a fraction of the total number of naturists in our country. Not everyone joins one of our 17 clubs and departments. According to surveys, about half a million Belgians sometimes do nudist recreation: they go to nudist beaches, spend their holidays at a naturist campsite or regularly go to public saunas.”He added of the growth in numbers: “The new members mainly come from the age group 30 to 40. Where the work pressure is often the greatest. Naturism is literally unbuttoning. Those who leave their clothes leave the mobile phone and the work behind them. And it fits perfectly with the great call to go back to nature.”Reflecting such growth, the first Belgian naturist B\u0026ampB has opened in Nieuwpoort. “We have room for two families,” said its proprietor, Ann Engelen. “Every room has its own dining room, so you are not sitting naked at the breakfast table with other families. But in the garden with swimming pool, sauna and jacuzzi, that is the intention. “Some of our customers are people who take the first step towards naturism here. Often they are busy people who come to recharge their batteries for two days without clothes, an ideal tool against burnouts. They literally throw off their armour without being seen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b7674a04d402451d012d4e9767f36535d9e1d5c/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37e8129ac7f1b535c930717840c6200f","title":"china outcry over sale of 250000 faulty vaccines prompts investigation","story":"Chinese social media posts expressed anger with hashtag #Changsheng vaccine case# being viewed 470 million times by Monday Chinese premier Li Keqiang has called for an immediate investigation into the sale of 250,000 faulty rabies vaccines that he said had crossed a moral line, while urging severe punishment for the companies and people implicated.Outrage swept Chinese social media on Monday as regulators and officials tried to contain fallout over revelations that one of the country’s largest vaccine makers had been giving children defective vaccines.Regulators last week ordered the Jilin-based Changsheng Biotechnology to stop production of a rabies vaccine, after investigators found fabricated production and inspection records during an inspection that was prompted by a tip off. Changsheng said in a stock market filing later in the week that authorities were punishing the company over a “substandard” DPT vaccine for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. On Sunday, China’s food and drug administration said it was investigating Changsheng, whose name means “long life,” and that all production had been halted. The company issued a statement expressing its “deepest apology.”There have been no reports of injuries or side effects from the vaccines and Chinese officials and state media have released statements promising accountability. But a lack of public trust continues, as parents remember the government’s handling of previous public health crises. In 2008, six children died and 300,000 fell ill after drinking milk powder tainted with melamine, a case officials initially had covered up.“I just want to express a mother’s anxiety ... the vaccine case is like pouring poison into the well,” one commentator wrote on Weibo. “I am truly terrified.” Another wrote, “People ask why I don’t have children. It’s because I don’t want my child to drink tainted milk powder, to be injected with fake vaccines ... I don’t want to see what happened to our generation to happen to the next.” Censors, which at first deleted critical Wechat articles, seemed to allow the deluge of public discussion. The hashtag #Changsheng vaccine case# had been viewed over 470 million times as of Monday.Online commentators also posted on the US embassy’s Weibo page. “Please ask the ambassador to help us call for human rights and give a child a lifeline. The fake vaccines have been uncovered, poisoned milk powder overflows. Save the children,” one said.Another said: “Mr. Ambassador, tell Mr. Trump, liberate China. We don’t want our children and grandchildren to be persecuted by their vaccines.”Chinese premier Li Keqiang condemned the sale of the faulty vaccines: “We will resolutely crack down on illegal and criminal acts that endanger the safety of people’s lives, resolutely punish lawbreakers according to the law, and resolutely and severely criticise dereliction of duty in supervision,” Li said.It is unclear how many children received Changsheng vaccines. Parents are required to follow a vaccine schedule for their children.Chinese state media reported that 250,000 doses of the DPT vaccine in question had been sold to the province of Shandong. The company recalled 186 doses that were still in stock at the regional disease centre. Changsheng said other regional disease control agencies have suspended use of some of the company’s other vaccines.The Changsheng case further erodes public trust in Chinese-made drugs, which the government has been trying to promote. In 2016 police in Shandong province found $90 m in vaccines had been improperly stored and sold throughout the country. Last week, a heart drug made by Zhejiang Huaihai Pharmaceutical was recalled after regulators found an impurity in it linked to cancer.“Vaccines directly concern the health of children and are related to life,” state-run Global Times said in an editorial. “Every negative news item in this area will make all of society look at it.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae16128e71e87280ebadb6c38fe598471e23c4f/0_305_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3def798cc6965394ef37ed1ef6d34915","title":"i was tired of covering my face to hide from the mafia italian mp piera aiello","story":"Earlier this year, Piera Aiello became an Italian MP after campaigning with a veil over her face. Having now revealed her identity, she tells how she was forced to marry into the mafiaSipping a cappuccino in a cafe on Sicily’s Palermo docks, a woman is recalling a dramatic exchange with her daughter. A year ago, she explains, the 16-year-old had gone up to the attic of their home and opened a big dusty box that lay in the corner. Her parents had always forbidden her from entering the attic, or opening the box, but now the girl was determined to disobey them. Inside were about 10 packages, each inidually wrapped. They were paintings: landscapes, the sea, olive groves, the deep south. All were signed with the same name: Piera Aiello.Her mother entered the attic. “I painted them,” she said. “They’re beautiful,” her daughter replied. “But Mamma, if these paintings are yours, why are they signed by a different name? Who is Piera Aiello?”With tears in her eyes, her mother asked her daughter to sit down. “I am Piera Aiello,” she said. “It’s time I told you who I really am.”A tall woman with dark eyes and black hair, Aiello smiles and gesticulates wildly as she tells her story. Not far away, three armed police guards survey the surroundings, making sure no one gets too close. “My daughter’s curiosity in that attic was one among the many turning points in my life,” she says. “I told her to listen and I started from the beginning, a thousand miles away from that attic, in Sicily, where it all began.”Aiello was born in Partanna, a small village in western Sicily. Her father was a bricklayer, her mother a tailor. “My parents never let me want for anything. It was the best time of my life, by far. But, as they say, it was just the calm before the storm.”That storm arrived when Aiello was 14 and met a boy named Nicolò Atria. She didn’t know Nicolò was the son of Vito Atria, the local mafia boss. The godfather approved of Nicolò’s relationship with Aiello, not with a blessing but an order: Don Vito had decided that Aiello would marry his son. “Nicolò and I had had an argument, I don’t remember why. Don Vito came to my house. He asked my father if he could speak to me in private. He said: ‘You’re young. Take a few days to think it over. But in any case, you and Nicolò will soon be married. I know you love your family very much.” Aiello understood the veiled threat. “My future father-in-law had warned me that if I didn’t marry his son, he’d kill my mother and father. I couldn’t allow that to happen.”On 9 November 1985, in the tiny baroque church of Madonna delle Grazie in Partanna, Aiello became Nicolò’s wife. She was 18. Neither could have questioned Don Vito’s authority. Nicolò, too, was obliged to follow his father’s will and marry a girl he didn’t love. Back then, in Sicily, it often took much less to get killed a glance toward the wrong person, an unreciprocated greeting, was enough. “Once I saw Don Vito throw his wife in the pool because she had ‘humiliated him’ by throwing on the ground an ice-cream he had offered her. My mother-in-law didn’t know how to swim. Don Vito watched impassive from the poolside as she began to drown. Nicolò saved her from certain death. I’ll let you imagine what could have happened had I decided not to marry his son,” says Aiello.Don Vito was a traditional mafioso, bound to a ruthless code of honour. “I once asked Don Vito if it was true what people said about him around town, that he was the head of the Partanna mafia. He looked at me and laughed. He said he was someone whom ‘people came to when they needed to resolve a problem, like to find a stolen tractor or a job for a son’.”Nine days after Aiello’s wedding, he was murdered in the vineyards around Partanna. The illicit interests of the Sicilian mafia were changing. Heroin was flooding the streets of Italy and the new bosses decided to remove anyone in the older generation who refused to invest in the business. “That same day, in the mortuary in Partanna, in front of his father’s corpse, Nicolò swore that he would avenge his father’s death,” Aiello says. “He swore that he would kill the men who murdered his father.”Aiello spent her days making sweets in a pizzeria and cafe owned by Nicolò. Business was good, because people continued to respect “Don Vito Atria’s son”. “We used to take in a million lire a day,” Aiello recalls. Their life at home was less successful. She did not love Nicolò, who, in turn, beat her. Aiello began taking the pill. Nicolò’s desire to have a male heir weighed heavily on her, but she didn’t want to bear his child.“One day he forced me to see a doctor. When he learned that I had been taking the pill, he beat me for a week straight. Then he raped me.”Two years after Don Vito’s death, Aiello was pregnant. Nicolò hoped for a boy and said that he would name him Vito to honour his father. Aiello hoped against hope that she was not carrying a boy, who might become a boss like his father, or, even worse, like his grandfather.Being pregnant focused Aiello’s sense of rebellion against the criminal and chauvinistic culture in which she was trapped. “During the pregnancy, I decided to take the state exam to become a police officer. When Nicolò found out, he started beating me, as he’d always done. I never gave up. My resistance to every slap, kick or insult was my way of fighting Cosa Nostra.”Aiello never became a police officer. She didn’t pass the exam. But she did give birth to a girl she named Vita, or “Life”.Nicolò cared for his daughter like he had never cared for anyone before. On the rare occasions he cooked, it was for her that he made the best pizzas. The last one was in the shape of a heart. Aiello took it to Vita on the evening of 24 June 1991. “That same night, as soon as I’d entered the kitchen, I heard a scream from the front door. It happened so quickly. The curtains moved suddenly and I saw the shadows of two armed and hooded men.”Nicolò had kept his promise to avenge his father’s death. He had spoken about it with his men. And the mafia decided that he, too, should die. They shot him in the head, the arm and the abdomen, a ferocious volley of bullets from a sawn-off shotgun, the typical weapon used in mafia executions.Aiello tried to disarm the killers, but they grabbed her by the hair and threw her to the ground. When they left, Nicolò was already dead. The coroners removed more than 3lb (1.4kg) of ammunition from his gut.“My face was covered in my husband’s blood. I despised Nicolò, but I felt pity for him. He was just a boy, 27 years old, and they killed him like an animal.”One week after her husband’s murder, Aiello met district attorney Paolo Borsellino, who, with Giovanni Falcone, had recently carried out an investigation against the Sicilian mafia that resulted in hundreds of arrests. A strong friendship developed between Aiello and Borsellino. Aiello called him “Uncle Paolo” and he looked after her. He offered her an armed guard, found her a safe city to hide in, and helped her to leave Sicily. Rita Atria, Nicolò’s sister, went with her.Rita was 16, full of life, strong and sure of herself. Aiello had looked after her since she was a young girl. She knew that Rita’s choice would be even more difficult than her own. After all, she was Don Vito’s daughter. Rita had a blood relation within that mafia family. Her rebellion would have left a scar on the mafia’s code of honour that no vendetta could have set right.“We’d spend our days in police stations. Borsellino would often come and see us. We were afraid. We knew that the bosses were already plotting our deaths.“One day, after yet another interrogation, I ran out of the room in tears. Borsellino came out to hug me. I confessed that I was afraid of dying. He told me: ‘Nothing will happen to you.’ Smiling, he added: ‘I will certainly die before you.’”A few months later, in Palermo, on 19 July 1992, the mafia assassinated Borsellino with a car bomb in Via D’Amelio. Two months earlier, on 23 May, the same fate had struck Falcone, assassinated with 300kg of explosives on the motorway between Punta Raisi airport and Palermo. Today, Palermo International Airport is named after them the 13 November 2006 issue of Time Magazine listed them among the greatest heroes of the past 60 years.Aiello was desperate, Rita even more so. The mafia had killed her father, brother and now Borsellino, the man who had become her sole confidant. One week later, on 26 July 1992, Rita jumped off the seventh floor of an apartment building and killed herself.“I was devastated,” says Aiello. “I felt as if Rita had abandoned me. I felt I had the responsibility to carry on her rebellion, too. Only later did I realise that Rita’s gesture was that of a girl who had lost everything.”Rita’s and Aiello’s testimonies led to the arrest of dozens of mafiosi in the provinces of Agrigento and Trapani. Nicolò’s mother and Don Vito’s widow, Giovanna, never forgave her daughter and one day even set out to destroy her daughter’s tombstone with a hammer. “My mother-in-law hated both of us. She hoped they’d kill us. Our decision to become police informants was dishonourable to her. I never despised her. Both of us had been forced to marry men that we didn’t love. She had been raped by her father and never knew the meaning of true love. She was a victim of the mafia culture she grew up in.”Aiello made a new life for herself in northern Italy. She changed her name to Paola and started working as a babysitter. In her spare time, she painted. After a few years, she fell in love. Up to that moment her life had been conditioned by others the mafia chose her husband, the Italian state her new life. The time had come for her to make her own decisions, but there was one problem: “This man knew nothing about me. One evening, I invited him to dinner, and after our meal I asked him to sit down and listen to me.”Aiello told him about Nicolò, Don Vito, Borsellino and Rita. After, he asked her to marry him and they were wed on 8 August 2000. The priest was Don Ciotti, an anti-mafia activist living under police escort. Her witness was Salvatore Borsellino, Paolo’s brother, and among the guests were magistrates and members of the police force engaged in the struggle against the mafia.Her new husband promised to keep Aiello’s secret even from their two daughters. She worked as a babysitter until they were born, then settled into life as a housewife. Once in a while, the police asked her to give speeches in schools, or at events organised by anti-mafia associations. She would do so anonymously, covering her face. Until that fateful afternoon in the attic.“That evening we all gathered in the living room. A few weeks earlier I had been contacted by politicians from the Five Star Movement, who asked me to run for parliament in the upcoming elections. I wasn’t convinced, but my daughter persuaded me. She said that after everything I had been through, this was an important opportunity to bring my experience to parliament.”Aiello began an electoral campaign but, unlike other candidates, she could not show her face, have her photograph taken, or hold public rallies. She was still under police protection, and the authorities were still responsible for her safety. Because she covered her face with a veil or a scarf, she became known as the “faceless candidate”.In March, Aiello was elected to parliament. Most of her votes came from Trapani, and she “was very happy, because Trapani is the last stronghold of the Sicilian mafia, the kingdom of Matteo Messina Denaro, who is still at large”. They also came from all quarters of society – doctors, lawyers, workers, farmers, young and old.“I chose this party because it was the only one that would allow me to express myself freely,” she says. Under police protection, she had realised that police informants are often abandoned by the state after their information has been used. This will be the focus of her agenda in parliament, she says, a decision that has made her an even greater target for the mafia – making the lives of informants better means encouraging people to rebel. The election was not, however, conclusive, and in the tricky days following, the Five Star Movement had to form a controversial and difficult alliance with the Lega, a xenophobic party led by Matteo Salvini, a controversial senator who is now the minister of the interior. One of his first acts was to close Italian seaports to the Aquarius, a ship carrying 629 rescued migrants. Aiello doesn’t conceal her disapproval of Salvini’s choices: “He should talk less. Italy cannot reject immigrants. We must improve the services made available to them once they arrive.”On 13 June, after her election, and 27 years after she first went into hiding, Aiello decided that she had had enough. “I was tired of covering my face,” she says. “In addition to this, the law allows state witnesses to show their faces once they are elected. Cameras were all around in the parliament anyway. So I said: ‘Why not?’” Her assistant got in touch with the , and she gave this paper the first photograph. She chose the day she first landed in Sicily as an MP. “I wanted it to happen in Sicily,” she says, “where everything began.” Once in front of the camera, “I was really embarassed and timid. But it was like coming back to life. That day, in the attic, when my daughter discovered my paintings, my life changed. I, Piera Aiello, have returned and will no longer hide myself in the attic.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3573087.1532285010!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new figures show extent of class gap in higher education","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents from fee-paying schools are far more likely to attend a handful of top Dublin-based universities, new figures show. Photograph: iStockNew figures show the extent of the “class gap” in higher education with students from fee-paying schools far more likely to attend a handful of top Dublin-based universities.Students from fee-paying schools account for 20-25 per cent of undergraduates at Trinity and UCD.By contrast, they account for less than 1 per cent of students at institutes of technology in Athlone, Galway-Mayo, Tralee, Letterkenny and Waterford. Geography is a clear factor, given the majority of second-level fee paying students are in the south Dublin area. However, the social ide is also stark when enrolment numbers are broken down by students from disadvantaged areas or Deis schools.Disadvantaged students account for 20-30 per cent of undergraduates at institutes of technology in Blanchardstown, Tallaght, Tralee and Letterkenny.The proportion of Deis students at Trinity and UCD, by contrast, is below 5 per cent.The figures are contained in a study by the Higher Education Authority and relate to the 201516 academic year.The social ide in the enrolment patterns to third level are likely to lead to a fresh focus on whether top universities are doing enough to attract students from more disadvantaged areas.For example, the proportion of school-leavers progressing to third level in affluent areas such as Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 is in excess of 95 per cent, while it falls to about 20 per cent in less well-off areas such as Dublin 17.The Government points out that it is funding a range of programmes to boost the numbers of “under-represented groups” at third-level institutions.For example, a three-year national access plan, published by the Higher Education Authority in 2017, aims to increase the number of students with disabilities and mature students who have never been to college at third level by 1,500.Inidual institutions also have targets, as part of funding agreements with the Higher Education Authority, for the proportion of students from disadvantaged or non-traditional backgrounds to enrol in a given year.Institutions such as Trinity and UCD have been exploring different approaches to boosting these numbers.A recent Trinity study, for example, found that secondary students in poorer areas of Dublin were three times more likely to plan to go to college after being assigned a mentor.Other research shows that students from disadvantaged backgrounds face a much bigger challenge in staying in third level once they get there.A recent HEA study found the rates of students who fail to progress beyond the first year of their college course is almost double for students from Deis schools compared to fee-paying schools .While 19 per cent of students from Deis schools failed to progress, this compared to 10 per cent from fee-paying schools.Research indicates that academic performance and financial considerations are some of the key factors which help determine if students progress.The third level institutions with the highest proportions of Deis students included institutes of technology in Letterkenny (28 per cent), Tallaght (23 per cent), Blanchardstown and Tralee (21 per cent) and Waterford (15 per cent)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3573118.1532287642!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary school teachers may be converted for second level roles","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland’s secondary school population is projected to rise until 2024.

Other potential measures include sharing teachers across schools in certain subject areas exploring the potential to train native speakers as language teachers and financial incentives to take up teacher training programmes, which can cost €10,000-15,000.Teachers’ unions insist the teacher supply “crisis” is the result of austerity era pay rates for teachers hired after 2011.However, the department has only accepted that there are “pinch points” in certain areas, such as key subjects and substitute cover at primary level.Steering group members – which include officials from the department, the Teaching Council, nominees of the higher education sector and the school management bodies – have identified “cost of living” challenges as a significant issue for young teachers.In addition, they have focused on the “casualisation” of the profession, with many working part-time hours for long periods.A spokesman for the department said proposals such as converting primary teachers to secondary teachers were being considered as part of the steering group’s work.He said the group was established earlier this year to develop a programme of actions on teacher supply and oversee its implementation.The spokesman said that, in the meantime, more new teachers were being hired than at any other time in the history of the State."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3572966.1532335767!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"false information about dublin bus redesign slated by planner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Dublin Bus network redesign sees the replacement of all existing route numbers with a simplified lettering system. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe US transport planner behind the redesign of the Dublin Bus network has hit back at TDs and union officials for spreading “false information” about the proposed new service.Jarrett Walker, who has redrawn the network for the National Transport Authority, has urged bus users to “beware of rumours” about the changes to routes and read the redesign planswhich are currently open to public submissions. The redesign sees the scrapping of all existing route numbers, and their replacement with a simplified lettering system, along with the creation of new orbital and local “feeder” bus routes.Mr Walker’s comments follow complaints last week at an Oireachtas Transport Committee about the plans.Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said commuters on the outskirts of the capital would be “the real losers” under the plan. “The further you get from the city the greater the loss is,” she said.Independents4Change TD Joan Collins said bus users in working-class areas would have worse services than those living in in Rathmines and Rathgar. Double-decker buses with 99 people on them travelling in or out from the city centre will link up with smaller buses for the orbital routes that will only be able to take 28 passengers, she said.The committee heard from National Bus and Railworkers’ Union general secretary Dermot O’Leary who said the changes would end many direct services to the city centre and damage services to working-class communities. Mr Walker said these comments showed a fundamental misunderstanding of how the new network would operate.“Unfortunately, in the first weeks since the plan was released, we’ve seen lots of false information circulating about it, including in statements put out by some people commenting on the report,” he said.“A big idea is that most services into the city centre would be organised into spines with branches. So for example, the A Spine, going south from the city centre toward Terenure, is made up of buses marked A1, A2, A3, and A4. Any “A” bus will go to Terenure, but after that, A1 continues toward Knocklyon, A2 continues toward Tallaght, and so on. So every bus on every branch still has direct service to the city centre.”The current inner city bus network was “insanely complex”, he said. “Do you want to get from the city centre to Rathgar? Then you need to know you could use the 14, 15, 15a, 15b, 65b, 83, 83a. In the new network, you just remember A, because all the A buses do that, no matter which number is after the letter.”However, there were “trade-offs”, he said. “Some trips require an interchange that do not today, although shorter waiting times mean these trips can be faster than they are now.” The system would create a more efficient network for inner Dublin “while still serving many suburban areas directly”, he said.The plans are available to view at busconnects.ie. “We want everyone’s comments on the plan, but first, make sure you understand it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3573670.1532341675!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"humanity devouring resources faster than it can create them","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEarth Overshoot Day: humanity is on course to exhaust Earth’s annual resources by August 1st  Photograph: GettyHumanity is devouring our planet’s resources in increasingly destructive volumes, according to a new study that reveals we have consumed a year’s worth of carbon, food, water, fibre, land and timber in a record 212 days.As a result, the Earth Overshoot Day – which marks the point at which consumption exceeds the capacity of nature to regenerate – has moved forward two days to August 1st, the earliest date ever recorded.To maintain our current appetite for resources, we would need the equivalent of 1.7 Earths, according to Global Footprint Network, an international research organisation that makes an annual assessment of how far humankind is falling into ecological debt.The overshoot began in the 1970s, when rising populations and increasing average demands pushed consumption beyond a sustainable level. Since then, the day at which humanity has busted its annual planetary budget has moved forward.Thirty years ago, the overshoot was on October 15th. Twenty years ago, September 30th. Ten years ago, August 15th. There was a brief slowdown, but the pace has picked back up in the past two years. On current trends, next year could mark the first time, the planet’s budget is busted in July.While ever greater food production, mineral extraction, forest clearance and fossil-fuel burning bring short-term (and unequally distributed) lifestyle gains, the long-term consequences are increasingly apparent in terms of soil erosion, water shortages and climate disruption.The day of reckoning is moving nearer, according to Mathis Wackernagel, chief executive and co-founder of Global Footprint Network.“Our current economies are running a Ponzi scheme with our planet,” he said. “We are borrowing the Earth’s future resources to operate our economies in the present. Like any Ponzi scheme, this works for some time. But as nations, companies, or households dig themselves deeper and deeper into debt, they eventually fall apart.”The situation is reversible. Research by the group indicates political action is far more effective than inidual choices. It notes, for example, that replacing 50 per cent of meat consumption with a vegetarian diet would push back the overshoot date by five days.Efficiency improvements in building and industry could make a difference of three weeks, and a 50 per cent reduction of the carbon component of the footprint would give an extra three months of breathing space.In the past, economic slowdowns – which tend to reduce energy consumption – have also shifted the ecological budget in a positive direction. The 2007-2008 financial crisis saw the date push back by five days. Recessions in the 1990s and 1980s also lifted some of the pressure, as did the oil shock of the mid 1970s.But the overall trend is of costs increasingly being paid by planetary support systems. Separate scientific studies over the past year has revealed a third of land is now acutely degraded, while tropical forests have become a source rather than a sink of carbon.Scientists have also raised the alarm about increasingly erratic weather, particularly in the Arctic, and worrying declines in populations of bees and other insect pollinators, which are essential for crops.–"},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site   July 19, 2018Department warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tomb   July 21, 2018Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne finds have captured public\u0026rsquos imagination, and raise questions for the State "},{"url":null,"title":"second brexit vote morally justified says john major","story":"  July 22, 2018Brexit secretary says UK could refuse to pay \u0026euro39bn \u0026lsquoorce bill\u0026rsquo without trade deal "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

a £13m property overlooking Hyde Park.Bujak used a company called Foris Fortuna to act as \u0027agent\u0027 in the sale of Princes Gate and net himself and Adrian Dugdale, 46, a total of around £150,000.The former army officer was finally rumbled when the charity\u0027s finance officer noticed one supposed business trip coincided with his honeymoon.Bujak shook his head and sighed in the dock as he was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court.Judge Peter Testar, said: Mr Bujak has an extremely strong personality - I think for the first time in my career, I saw a defendant bullying counsel.The sustained high levels of aggression shown by Mr Bujak were quite extraordinary.Right thinking people will be astonished and appalled to discover what Mr Bujak did in taking advantage as the CEO.Dugdale was spared jail for VAT fraud after Judge Peter Testar described him as a decent man who was led into this by others.Bujak was issued with a company credit card shortly after joining the charity as Chief Executive Officer in 2003.He created false invoices to cover up personal spending on the company credit card, describing hotel bills and Selfridges shopping sprees as conference and PRadvert.Bujak even used the credit card to pay for restoration and framing of the watercolours of warships which he had bought at auction with the very same card.He billed Montessori four times between 2010 and 2013 for various family reunions at The De Vere hotel at Dunston Hall, in Norwich.This hotel was a favourite haunt of the Bujak family,\u0027 said prosecutor Benjamin Douglas-Jones QC.On four occasions between 2010 and 2013 Mr Bujak, through the use of the credit card, paid for various family events that where held there.He one bill for £465 on 2 October 2010 was for a charity conference when it was really for his mother\u0027s 80th birthday party.Several other family reunions costing nearly £2,000 each time were also labelled on bank statements in this way.British tourist \u0026#39dies taking selfie\u0026#39 after falling from cliff whale-watching in AustraliaTheresa May refuses to back Sajid Javid over decision not to block death penalty for Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39Toronto shooting: Two dead and 12 hurt as gunman opens fire in street before being killed in shootoutCelebrity Big Brother 2018: all the rumoured contestants, from Samantha Markle to Noel EdmondsFive arrested as woman with slit throat staggers from Hilton hotel to flag down policeMalta PM and wife cleared over corruption scandal at heart of murdered journalist\u0026#39s claimsSajid Javid tells US: We won\u0026#39t block  death penalty for Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39Plans outlined for 2,000 supersonic jets to link hundreds of cities across the planetFrance introduces upskiting law inspired by stalled British effortsJair Bolsonaro: Hard-Right frontrunner dubbed \u0026#39Trump of the Tropics\u0026#39 formally enters race for Brazil presidencyUK weather: Met Office urges people to \u0026#39stay out of sun\u0026#39 until Friday as heatwave set to reach 34CAmazon warning of \u0026#39civil unrest\u0026#39 after no deal Brexit is absurd, says Jacob Rees-Mogg New malaria treatment paves way for eradicationRecord temperatures in Japan as deadly heatwave continues\u0026#39Snowflake\u0026#39 label is unfair -

Some said they had called police but they took no action against the culprits, many of whom are believed to have posted their footage online.A victim posted on Twitter: “Urgent please: A guy filmed under my skirt in a shopping centre. We called the police. Can you tell me what I can do?”Marion, 29, said a man had tried to film her in the Paris Métro. “He was sitting opposite me and I saw him trying to film under my skirt with his mobile phone. I raised my voice and told him to stop… He did… muttering and staying calmly in his seat.”Women and young people are most likely to say they’ve experienced sexual harassmentHalf of women in France wear trousers on public transport to avoid harassment, according to a survey. Some say they have taken to wearing shorts under their skirts to defend themselves against upskirting.Adèle told Le Parisien newspaper that she had grabbed and broken the phone of a man who filmed her on the Métro and a 17-year-old said she had felt violated after being filmed on an escalator in a shopping centre.Upskirting is already illegal in Belgium but police say few women report it to the police.Olivier Slosse, a Brussels police spokesman, urged more women to report upskirting or voyeurism. “We only get about 20 complaints a year for this kind of voyeurism. It’s important for the victims to come forward because they are the victims of an illegal act, and it’s important for us because these crimes are under-reported and it helps draw our attention to them.” A proposed law to ban upskirting was blocked in the UK by senior Tory MP Sir Christopher Chope.

It is designed to make local services aware that these conditions are being met and for them to take action.Stay out of the sun, the Met Office advice reads. Keep your home as cool as possible – shading windows and shutting them during the day may help.Open them when it is cooler at night. Keep drinking fluids. If there\u0027s anybody you know, for example an older person living on their own, who might be at special risk, make sure they know what to do.Members of the public were also urged to take the usual precautions in the sun, including covering up, wearing sun screen and drinking plenty of water.The ongoing heatwave means nearly all parts of the UK are seeing above average temperatures, but it will be hot or very hot towards the east or south east.During the current heatwave, UK temperatures have been approximately 10C higher than average for this time of year.The Met Office said: On Monday, hot and humid air will lie over the east and south east of England, with cloud and outbreaks of rain across northern England.The cloud and rain will gradually break up and turn showery in the north, with some of these heavy and thundery.South of the rain, long spells of sunshine, will develop with temperatures generally ranging from very warm in West and East Midlands, to hot and humid, locally very hot in east and southeastern areas.Away from northern England, dry and sunny weather should dominate through the week, but interspersed with heavy showers in afternoon and evening periods. Temperatures will be very warm or hot, locally very hot in the east.Thresholds could be breached in places from Monday onwards, with very warm and muggy overnight conditions.Yorkshire and Humber and southwest England will also see temperatures rise through the week, but with cloud and outbreaks of rain affecting the north and west, there is a lower risk of thresholds being reached. There is a chance that Alerts will need to be downgraded andor extended for the end of the week, however confidence is currently low and this will be reviewed through the week.FAQ | Health and heatwavesTemperatures could soar to more than 34C (93.2F) in some parts of the country on Wednesday, beating the 33C (91.4F) recorded at Porthmadog in North Wales on June 28.Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: It does look likely it will be at least 33C at some point this week, most likely on Wednesday or Thursday, in the south east and east, London, Essex, Kent, east Anglia and into Lincolnshire - and that would make it the hottest day we have had so far.Temperatures are likely to be lower elsewhere. Forecasters said there is a chance of hitting 34C or 35C (95F), which could put Britons in line for the hottest day since the mercury hit 34.5C (94.1F) at Heathrow on June 21 last year.The hottest July day on record is 36.7C (98F), which was reached at Heathrow on July 1 2015.The hot weather will lead to thunderstorms and it could all happen on the same day, Mr Burkill added.He said: The heat and humidity means there is a lot of energy in the air and a high risk of intense thunderstorms. Whether or not it will happen is where the uncertainty is.Instead of 23C (73.4F) which could usually be expected in London in July, temperatures could tip 34C (93.2).Scotland, which averages 17C (62.6), could enjoy highs of up to 25C (77F), while Wales could jump to 26C (78.8F) or 27C (80.6F) instead of 19.2C (66.5F).Those in Northern Ireland may be basking in 24C (75.2F) rather than the July average of 18.5C (65.3F).Mr Burkill also said the current run of fine weather looks set to continue.He said: It always seems that when the schools break up that is when we get the bad weather, but in this instance that is not the case.For the latest UK weather news, click here.Please review our commenting policyBritish tourist \u0026#39dies taking selfie\u0026#39 after falling from cliff whale-watching in AustraliaTheresa May refuses to back Sajid Javid over decision not to block death penalty for Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39Toronto shooting: Two dead and 12 hurt as gunman opens fire in street before being killed in shootoutCelebrity Big Brother 2018: all the rumoured contestants, from Samantha Markle to Noel EdmondsFive arrested as woman with slit throat staggers from Hilton hotel to flag down policeMalta PM and wife cleared over corruption scandal at heart of murdered journalist\u0026#39s claimsSajid Javid tells US: We won\u0026#39t block  death penalty for Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39Plans outlined for 2,000 supersonic jets to link hundreds of cities across the planetFrance introduces upskiting law inspired by stalled British effortsJair Bolsonaro: Hard-Right frontrunner dubbed \u0026#39Trump of the Tropics\u0026#39 formally enters race for Brazil presidencyAmazon warning of \u0026#39civil unrest\u0026#39 after no deal Brexit is absurd, says Jacob Rees-Mogg New malaria treatment paves way for eradicationRecord temperatures in Japan as deadly heatwave continues\u0026#39Snowflake\u0026#39 label is unfair - the young are just better at showing feelings, say expertsJames Foley\u0026#39s mother says murdered journalist would not want his killers to face the death penalty Margaret Hodge stands by Jeremy Corbyn anti-Semitism accusation: \u0026#39You are judged by your actions, not your words\u0026#39Three men arrested over acid attack on boy aged 3 in WorcesterComment: We must build more houses – or both the nation and the Tories will suffer the consequencesThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/15/textile-waste-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/15/textile-waste-1.jpg","title":"burberry burns stock designer clothing fashion industry environment","story":"Created with Sketch.Upmarket British label has destroyed £105m of unwanted stock in past five yearsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBurberry burns £28.6m of clothes and cosmetics \u0027to protect its brand\u0027Burberry\u0026nbspdestroyed £28.6m of clothing and cosmetics last year as part of efforts to\u0026nbspprotect its upmarket brand and guard against counterfeiting.The luxury British label incinerated the equivalent of\u0026nbsp81,000 of its signature plaid scarves, according to its latest annual accounts, in a practice said to be rife among fashion houses.Industry insiders\u0026nbspsay high-end brands burn\u0026nbspunwanted stock to prevent their clothes being sold at knockdown prices and worn by the\u0026nbsp“wrong people”.But the fashion houses\u0026nbspsay surplus goods are incinerated to prevent them falling into the hands of counterfeiters.Burberry destroyed more than £90m of products over the last five years, and the amount burnt annually has increased dramatically. In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Ever since the first dino fossils were discovered in the early 19th\u0026nbspcentury, we have been desperate to know as much as we possibly can\u0026nbspabout these remarkable creatures. And as our knowledge grows, so our perceptions change.Imagine that time travel had been invented, and that for a limited time this summer you could journey back 67 million years\u0026nbspto the Late Cretaceous and the Age of the Dinosaurs, to see animals like Triceratops and\u0026nbspTyrannosaurus\u0026nbsproaming free in the landscape around you.Such is the opening premise of Dinosaurs in the Wild, a unique, immersive and\u0026nbspinteractive visitor attraction based at the Greenwich Peninsula, in London, until 2 September. I have been involved as the scientific consultant. Our aim with this experience is to present an absolutely modern, science-based view of dinosaurs and their world – and I’m pleased to say it has won critical praise from the palaeontologists, palaeoartists and other experts who’ve visited so far. However, things are a bit weirder than you might imagine.It’s the look of our dinosaurs, created using the latest photo-real computer generated imagery,\u0026nbspthat most strikes visitors. The creatures are boldly patterned, brightly coloured, often fuzzy, feathery or spiny, and with unusual features that make their fleshy outlines different from their skeletons. These aren’t the dinosaurs your parents or grandparents would have seen in the books or exhibitions of previous generations. Nor are they even the dinosaurs of cinema’s most notable dinosaur-themed outing, 1993’s Jurassic Park, nor of its sequels (including 2015’s Jurassic World and 2018’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom).Indeed, this week marks the 25th anniversary of Jurassic Park’s UK cinema release, and even now it has to be considered a milestone event in cinema. It took CGI, robotics and model-making to a new level, wowing audiences with the innovations and craftmanship of Steven Spielberg’s team, Stan Winston Studio and Industrial Light and Magic.And from the perspective of science education as well, Jurassic Park was a major score. Gone were the solitary, tail-dragging, Godzilla-like monsters of yore. Instead we saw complex, group-living animals that walk and run like birds, keep their tails up off the ground, and are smart enough to ambush humans and negotiate the interiors of buildings.Alamosaurus\u0026nbsp (Dinosaurs in the Wild)In bringing this science-based view of dinosaurs to the silver screen, Spielberg naturally worked with expert consultants. The result was that the view of dinosaurs that emerged among palaeontologists during the late 1960s – a scientific and cultural event known as the Dinosaur Renaissance – found a new audience. So significant and inspirational was Jurassic Park’s scientifically informed view of dinosaurs that many professionals working on dinosaurs and other ancient animals today trace their nascent interest in the subject to the movie.But if Jurassic Park was so on the ball, why are the dinosaurs in the new\u0026nbspDinsosaurs of the Wild attraction so very different? The answer is that much has changed in the past few decades in our scientific understanding of dinosaurs. So much so that 1993 feels like a long time ago, with the result that Jurassic Park’s dinosaurs are now surprisingly dated.Notably, the people behind Jurassic Park opted not to feather their dinosaurs, specifically the bird-like predator Deinonychus (called Velociraptor in the movie). There are two takes on this issue. One is that the scientists of the early 1990s didn’t have sufficient fossil evidence to run with the idea of feathery dinosaurs. After all, a feathered, non-bird dinosaur fossil didn’t show up until 1996 (the term “non-bird dinosaur” is now a necessity given that birds are dinosaurs in the same way that primates are mammals). That fossil is the original specimen of Sinosauropteryx, a small, long-tailed predator that lived in eastern China around 130 million years ago.But a second take is that, although the idea of feathery non-bird dinosaurs was looking really, really likely even in 1992-93 (the skeletons of early birds like Archaeopteryx and near-bird dinosaurs like Deinonychus and Velociraptor are extremely similar), the technological limitations of the time and Spielberg’s argument that a feathery Deinonychus just wouldn’t look scary led Jurassic Park’s creators to play it safe.Two and half decades on and hundreds of feathered dinosaur fossils have now been unearthed from the same region that yielded Sinosauropteryx. These and other fossils found in recent times show that feathers and feathery-like filaments, quills and fuzz were widespread across the large group of bird-like, mostly predatory dinosaurs called coelurosaurs. Among this group are the tyrannosaurs. So – should tyrannosaurs be fuzzy or feathery as well?The 2016 discovery of a giant, fuzz-covered tyrannosaur in China – the nine-metre long Yutyrannus – proves that big tyrannosaurs were indeed, just like their smaller cousins, in which case even the gigantic Tyrannosaurus should be reconstructed with a fuzzy coat. Based on this evidence, the Tyrannosaurus at Dinosaurs in the Wild has feathering across at least some of its upper surface. But this idea has since been contested: some experts argue that skin impressions show how Tyrannosaurus and kin underwent an evolutionary transition back to scaly skin. Argument here continues and more data is needed.Tyrannosaurus fighting an Ankylosaurus (Dinosaurs in the Wild)Dinosaurs were flamboyant, showy creatures. Frills, crests and horns on the head and sails and spines along the back were commonplace. Similar structures in living animals – cattle, deer, beetles and chameleons – are associated with sexual display and with battles that occur during the breeding season. Combine this with the fact that dinosaurs almost definitely had excellent colour vision – an inference based on eyesight in their living relatives – and the Age of Dinosaurs was surely flashy, colourful, even gaudy.Jurassic Park and Jurassic World again opted to be conservative, there being much grey and mud brown but little else. We very much went for the opposite in Dinosaurs in the Wild. Our Triceratops has red striping across its face and enormous bony frill, our tyrannosaurs have bright red faces used in signalling and intimidation, and our feathery Dakotaraptor is patterned in black and white and has a red forehead.Hard evidence for the colours of dinosaurs is rare but does at least exist: microscopic cellular structures termed melanosomes were reported from dinosaur fossils in 2010 and have so far been identified in around eight non-bird dinosaurs. They reveal evidence for colours, patterns and even iridescence on the feathers and skin of select species, and more such discoveries are sure to be forthcoming now that experts know what to look for.New thinking also has it that dinosaurs were not just gaudy and colourful. As explained in the 2012 book All Yesterdays, both the anatomy of living animals and a number of “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns” (thanks, Rumsfeld) render it likely that dinosaurs were sometimes weirder in anatomy than long thought. Air-filled sacs distributed throughout the body and skeleton, enormous bony hollows surrounding the nostrils and evidence for big masses of erectile tissue on the face suggest that some dinosaurs had inflatable or erectile wattles, dewlaps, sacs and other structures. This sounds odd but such structures are present in many modern birds and would be hard or impossible to predict if we only knew these animals from their bones.It’s for this reason that the gigantic, armour-plated Ankylosaurus\u0026nbsp in our vision possesses inflatable facial structures best described as cheek balloons.\u0026nbspSurprising yet plausible features like this may well have been commonplace across the dinosaur world.Finally, what about behaviour? The Jurassic franchise has always made nods to the idea – made scientifically robust during the Dinosaur Renaissance – that dinosaurs of many sorts were more social and behaviourally complex than the solitary brutes of convention.Fossil nests discovered in the 1970s showed that dinosaurs of several sorts nested colonially, that nest-building and nest-care were common, and that at least some species guarded their babies and even provisioned them with food. Baby dinosaurs preserved away from the nest environment are typically found in groups and are sometimes found in association with the remains of an adult.And both tracks and assemblages of skeletons show that many dinosaurs lived in groups, ranging from twos or threes in big predators to tens or hundreds in the case of many plant-eaters. It remains open to debate as to whether Deinonychus and its kin used the coordinated group-hunting portrayed in Jurassic Park, but the door is certainly open for social behaviour of many kinds.One very specific behavioural nugget does separate Jurassic Park from Dinosaurs in the Wild. Our dinosaurs don’t roar like lions. Roaring with a wide-open mouth seems normal to us, because we’re mammals. But dinosaurs aren’t mammals, and if we look at their closest living relatives – crocodylians and big birds like emus and ostriches – we see that loud sounds are made with a closed mouth, the noises emanating from the throat and chest.Dinosaurs in the Wild Dinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildMaybe this is an example of science ruining something that seems awesome and dramatic. Or maybe this is one of those cases where we benefit by having our assumptions corrected by discovery where we learn that nature is sometimes different from that which we might expect.Add all of this together, and science is revealing a colourful, vibrant, complex Age of Dinosaurs quite different from the one imagined back when Jurassic Park was under production. Dinosaurs in the Wild\u0026nbsppresents the scientific state of the art as it stands in 2018. But much remains to be discovered and a scientific attraction constructed decades from now may well look even more remarkable.Dr Darren Naish is a palaeontologist and scientific consultant at Dinosaurs in the Wild.\u0026nbspHaving thrilled time travellers in Birmingham and Manchester, the experience is now established at a custom-built home on London’s Greenwich Peninsula, a short walk from\u0026nbspNorth Greenwich Underground station,\u0026nbspuntil 2 September.

She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But they feared that there was so many smaller galaxies contained within that it would be impossible to learn about any specific one.New computer simulations allowed them to find that while Andromeda had eaten many galaxies, many of the stars found in the halo actually came from one larger shredded galaxy.It was a \u0027eureka\u0027 moment. We realised we could use this information of Andromeda\u0027s outer stellar halo to infer the properties of the largest of these shredded galaxies, said lead author Richard\u0026nbspD\u0027Souza, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan.That galaxy is a long-lost sibling of our own.Astronomers have been studying the Local Group – the Milky Way, Andromeda and their companions – for so long. It was shocking to realize that the Milky Way had a large sibling, and we never knew about it, said co-author Bell, professor of astronomy at the same university.The researchers hope that the discovery can lead to new breakthroughs in understanding how galaxies form and evolve.It also explains some of the strange behaviour in our own universe. It could answer the puzzle of why the\u0026nbspM32\u0026nbspsatellite galaxy near Andromeda has come from – it might be the surviving core of that long-lost sibling, sticking around like the core in a plum.M32 is a weirdo, Bell said. While it looks like a compact example of an old, elliptical galaxy, it actually has lots of young stars. It\u0027s one of the most compact galaxies in the universe. There isn\u0027t another galaxy like it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However Mr Bannon did not indicate how the project would be funded.He said he believed that right-wing populist nationalism is the future of Europe after decades of integration.The Brexit referendum victory in 2016 was followed by the election of Donald Trump in the US and the rise of right-winger Matteo\u0026nbspSalvini to become Italy\u0027s deputy prime minister this year.World news in picturesIsraeli-annexed Golan Heights  shows a smoke plume rising across the border in Quneitra in southwestern Syria, as rebels destroy their arms stocks prior to their departure.

In preparation for the demo, David and our guitarist Neville Wills wrote two to three songs.“We had decided that we would do a couple of guitar instrumentals and one original song. I chose I Never Dreamed as it was the strongest, the other two were a bit weak.1990s (PA)Record company Decca rejected the demo tape, but did give the band an audition later that year,

Britain would find that challenging but in the end we would find a way not just to survive but to thrive economically.”But my real concern is that it would change British public attitudes to Europe for a generation.“It would lead to a fissure in relations which would be highly damaging for that great partnership that we have had for so many years, which has been so important in sustaining the international order.”He continued: “I think that many people in the EU are thinking that they just have to wait long enough and Britain will blink.”\u0026nbspUK news in picturesSecretary of State for Exiting the European Union Dominic Raab on The Andrew Marr ShowGreat Britain\u0027s Tom Bosworth poses after winning the men\u0027s 3000m race walk with a new World Record time at the IAAF Diamond League athletics anniversary games meeting in LondonBritish Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a keynote speech at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast.

Trade unions called the delays “scandalous” and suggested minsters were trying to brush the issue under the carpet.In 2016, ministers announced plans to crack down on exploitative practices by banning or restricting employers taking tips that are given to staff, and making a voluntary code of practice for employers legally binding.It followed The Independent’s Fair Tips, Fair Pay\u0026nbspcampaign, which revealed that a number of large restaurant chains were taking staff tips and using them to top up the wages of workers who were being paid less than the minimum wage.UK news in picturesExiting the European Union Secretary Dominic Raab on The Andrew Marr ShowGreat Britain\u0027s Tom Bosworth poses after winning the men\u0027s 3000m race walk with a new World Record time at the IAAF Diamond League athletics anniversary games meeting in LondonBritish Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a keynote speech at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast.

Britain held a national minute of silence on June 3, one year on from the London Bridge terror attack that killed eight people and injured dozens moreWilliam Buick ridding Masar celebrates crossing the line and winning the Investec Derby race on Derby Day at Epsom DownsDespite many companies\u0026nbsphaving responded to public pressure to\u0026nbspchange\u0026nbsptheir policies, some\u0026nbspcontinue to keep a cut of staff tips for themselves. Others, including Italian chain Strada, take a proportion of tips paid on card as a “handling charge”.Some firms, including Jamie Oliver’s Italian chain, have also been found to charge waiting staff a proportion of the bills paid by the people they serve, which is then distributed to other staff.The official consultation on clamping down on the practices closed on 27 June 2016 but the government is yet to respond to it.Ministers do not appear to have even started work on a response. Asked whether the government\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbspa copy of any\u0026nbspdraft response to the consultation, a Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) official said: “Following a search of our paper and electronic records, I have established that the information you requested is not held by this department.”Pushed on why it has still not published a response to the consultation, a BEIS spokesperson said: “The government is still considering options and will respond in due course.”Announcing the plans in 2016, Sajid Javid, then the business secretary and now the home secretary, said: “We’ve been very clear. As a one nation government we want workers who earn a tip to be able to keep it. That’s why I, like many others, was disappointed by the tipping practices of some of our well-known chains. This has to change.”Ministers were prepared to make legislative changes to protect workers, he added.An earlier government call\u0026nbspfor evidence had found more than 80 per cent of people thought staff should be allowed to keep the tips they earn.Commenting on the lack of government action, Ms Peacock, who recently introduced a Commons bill on protecting workers’ rights, said: “This month marks two years since the government closed its consultation on fair tips. The Tories promised it would lead to action, yet they now admit that they haven’t even started drafting a response.“While ministers drag their feet, workers and customers alike are being ripped off by rogue bosses who are grabbing tips that were intended for staff.She added: “It is appalling that staff, often in precarious employment, are going into another busy summer season without the basic protection they deserve, with workers at TGI Fridays worked to take strike action to demand their share.“Government inaction will only fuel the suspicion that they have quitely abandoned their promises and\u0026nbspwant to let rogue bosses off the hook. Ministers should come clean, and if they’re going to take real action to stop this scandal, they need to get on with it.”Dave Turnbull, regional officer at Unite,\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“It’s scandalous that the government appears to have not even started drafting a response yet.“Every day that passes since its consultation on fair tips closed is another day that allows bad bosses to exploit low paid workers.

Up to 8,000 lions are kept in more than 200 “canned hunting” breeding facilities. But experts believe they are helping to fuel wildlife trafficking by creating demand.Between 2008 and 2015, the South African\u0026nbspDepartment of Environmental Affairs issued permits for the export of more than 5,363 lion skeletons, research has shown. Last year the business brought in an estimated 16m South African rand (£908,000), according to the Captured in Africa Foundation.The new report’s key recommendations include:A zero-export quota on lion and other big-cat body parts for commercial purposes, including from captive sourcesA forensic investigation into the financial affairs of all lion breeders and bone tradersRestricting the keeping and breeding of big catsReviewing and improving animal protection and welfare legislationEnsuring that animal protection, welfare, care and respect are included in law, particularly in relation to permits for the keeping, sale, hunting and exporting of wild animals and body partsHowever, the department has approved an annual quota of 1,500 lion skeletons for export, almost double the previous year’s quota of 800.Linda Tucker‚ founder and head of the Global White Lion Protection Trust‚ wrote a heartfelt letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa‚ appealing to him to reverse the move.“Factory farming lions for killing is not a policy South Africa can defend, neither the old nor the new South Africa,” she wrote.Hunter \u0027gored to death by buffalo\u0027 moments after killing herd memberBig game hunter shot dead as he aimed at lion he wanted to killBig game hunter trampled to death by elephant in Namibia“As I write to you‚ 1,500 of our lions‚ incarcerated under abysmal conditions‚ have been committed to slaughterhouses in the inappropriately named ‘Free State’.“Once vilified for apartheid‚ our country will go down in history for legalising crimes against nature that supersede the wrongs perpetrated by the illegal trade in animal parts.“For our international reputation and true moral compass‚ I call upon you with all my heart to repeal this heinous legacy.”The South African government has justified the trade in bones as a by-product of the hunting industry and claimed the increased quota has been prompted by a growing stockpile.Spokesperson Albi Modise said the quota was based on a research project established by the SA National Bioersity Institute with Oxford University and the University of Kent which said there had been no discernible increase in the poaching of wild lions, although there appeared to be an increase in the poaching of captive-bred lions for body parts.But The Extinction Business\u0026nbspreport said by calculating the weight of consignments, experts believe\u0026nbspexporters are exceeding the export quotas – unchecked by Cites.It stated the industry is de facto fully supported by the state, “despite widespread opposition to the practice which is considered extremely cruel, linked to international criminal networks, a threat to Africa’s \u0026nbspwild animals population and run by a small monopoly \u0026nbspof operators purely for financial gain.Where not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.29 Swimming with dolphinsSome marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.79 Running of the BullsEvery year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further.

The Campaign Against Canned Hunting believes the bone trade is one of several damaging activities involving lions: the others are captive breeding, cub petting, volunteering and lion walks.President of the Born Free Foundation,\u0026nbspWill Travers, said earlier this year: “Unwitting tourists fuel this despicable industry by participating in activities such as petting cubs and walking with lions, while unsuspecting volunteers rear cubs in the mistaken belief they are destined to be released into the wild.“Once adult, many of these animals are moved to canned hunting\u0026nbspfacilities to be shot in enclosures by ‘sport hunters’. Their bones are then sold into an international trade sanctioned by the South African government.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Urban and rural areas are fighting the continuous battle against a scourge of plastic litter. On June 5, 2018 the United Nations mark the World Environment Day which plastic pollution is the main theme this yearElephants are a national icon and an endangered species in India, numbering only around 22,000. They are named as a Schedule 1 animal in the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act –\u0026nbspmeaning those who abuse them can face up to seven years in prison.Yet the fate of around 3,500 captive elephants remains a grey area in India’s laws. Licences to keep them can be obtained from the state’s chief wildlife warden, and in 2016 the Supreme Court observed that the animals could be kept as long as owners are not “unkind to elephants”.Mr Satyanarayan said international tourists and the public in general “need to understand what goes on behind the curtain, the ugly, vicious, evil trade that this whole thing inculcates”.\u0026nbspWoman mauled by lion after entering enclosure to take photographThousands more scientific experiments being carried out on horsesBadger cull exercise cost taxpayers £76,000 for each animal killedCircus elephant falls into audience in GermanyCommercially successful elephant attractions “create a demand that drives more poaching, more brutality, more illegal elephant trafficking and more captive elephants”, he said.“Every person who rides an elephant must know that, for a few minutes of their joy, it’s a life of nightmares for that elephant.”In a statement to The Independent, TripAdvisor said its 2016 policies to improve animal welfare standards in the tourism industry “focused on the experiences sector”, while Jungle Book was classified as accommodation on its website.“We do not have a direct booking relationship with all accommodations on our site, the booking options are often provided by partners, and therefore we are not currently in a position to vet them in the same way,” a spokesperson said.“That said, our commitment doesn’t stop with experiences.\u0026nbspWe are always considering the evolution of this policy, including exploring ways in which TripAdvisor can drive positive change in the tourism accommodation sector too.” Travellers who were unhappy with animal welfare standards at their accommodation should “write a review to warn others”, the spokesperson said.Thomas Cook said the review mentioning its rep was from 18 months ago and that the agency “does not sell that excursion and has not for some time”.A TUI spokesperson said at the time of publication that they would not be able to provide a full statement until they can “investigate this thoroughly with the resort”.The company that operates Jungle Book, Goa Ecotourism Adventures, did not respond to multiple requests for comment by email. A person manning the phones at the resort said they were unable to comment on the elephants’ welfare, and that director Joseph Barreto was out of country. Calls to a man identified as the manager of the hotel went unanswered.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Outside academics were brought in to collect and study the resulting data.In a survey of staff taken late last year, only 54 per cent of respondents said they felt able to manage their work-life balance. After the trial, that number jumped to 78 per cent. Stress levels decreased by around seven per cent, while metrics used to measure team engagement rose by around a fifth.Mr Barnes said employees also became more productive, spending less time on social media or non-work activity. One staff member told the CEO he had stopped looking at emails from his wife about an apartment search during work hours.What happens is you get a motivated, energized, stimulated, loyal work force, said Mr Barnes.

Only the ruling\u0026nbspUnited Russia fraction voted for, with all of the controlled “opposition” parties voting against.\u0026nbspSeveral deputies in the ruling party, hitherto known for demonstrative displays of loyalty, were mysteriously absent from the vote.\u0026nbspThe main provisions of the reform see the pension age increase from 60 for men and 55 for women, to 65 and 63 respectively. Its sponsors say the changes are necessary to bring the law into line with new life expectancy figures. Pension ages were last set in 1936, when pensioners accounted for no more than 2 per cent of the population. \u0026nbsp“Life has changed,”\u0026nbspthe employment\u0026nbspminister\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspTopilin\u0026nbsptold parliamentarians. “We can’t remain in the 1930s.”\u0026nbspThe contentious issue of pension reform has been raised several times in the last two decades, but the government has repeatedly chosen to delay. It presented the bill in\u0026nbspless than auspicious economic times. Most Russians have faced real-terms wage falls since 2014, and the outlook is grim.\u0026nbspMr Putin’s trust ratings have\u0026nbspfallen to the lowest recorded ebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters.Critics have also railed against the way the pensions plan was communicated, announced with no discussion a few hours before kick off during the opening match of the World Cup, between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. Fnance\u0026nbspminister Anton Siluanov has insisted that this was a coincidence, but the public outcry was real.\u0026nbsp“It is a bastardly way to introduce reform,” said the former Kremlin adviser Gleb Pavlovsky in an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station. “The people have a deal with the Kremlin in return for not protesting – and the most important part of that deal is that they are given the chance to survive.”\u0026nbspIn some regions\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspproposed pension ages fall below average life expectancy\u0026nbsp– in Chukotka,\u0026nbspin the country’s far east, the male life expectancy is 60.33, nearly five years below the proposed pension age.\u0026nbspFor many families\u0026nbspthe change will represent a fundamental shift to their way of life. Even according to state pollsters, eight out of\u0026nbsp10 Russians do not agree with the plans. There have already been\u0026nbspprotests against the reform.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the bill, 14 people were arrested at an unsanctioned rally in St Petersburg.\u0026nbspRegardless of whether significant protests follow, the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever,\u0026nbspsays the political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann\u0026nbsp“It is a tectonic shift. Even before the pension reform, people were viewing the state as less and less of a father figure. But the reform strengthens that perception.”In Ms Schulmann\u0027s view, these changes will affect the transfer of power between Vladimir Putin and his anointed successor, a process which may begin as early as 2021.\u0026nbspThe paw of Mr Putin has remained strangely hidden throughout the process. His press secretary,\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov, has distanced the president from the unpopular bill.\u0026nbspReports, on the other\u0026nbsphand, suggested the president approved the plan before its first reading. And all the while, state media have been kept under strict control. They have been told to avoid the word “reform”, to avoid associations with the “chaotic” 1990s, but nonetheless to keep close to a line emphasising the necessity of reform.\u0026nbspThere may not be protests, but the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever\u0026nbspBut the attempt to differentiate a\u0026nbspgood tsar from bad\u0026nbspboyars might not have been altogether successful.On the back of the controversy, trust\u0026nbspin Mr Putin has fallen to\u0026nbspthe lowest recorded\u0026nbspebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters. And perhaps more significantly, the president’s ratings are falling steadily\u0026nbspin line with government popularity. This is the first time this has happened since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\u0026nbspSome now wonder if the president is in danger of losing his Teflon coating.\u0026nbspIt may, of course, have been another coincidence, but on the eve and the day of the vote\u0026nbspthe Russian military released several videos purporting to show the testing of new cutting-edge “Avangard” and “Kinzhal” missiles.

Until four years ago Fatima Abu Shedeg was not only unable to swim but had never been in a pool.\u0026nbspYet despite the challenges she has faced, she spends her days dreaming of stepping onto the starting block at\u0026nbspthe Tokyo 2020 Games as Gaza’s first Olympic swimmer.\u0026nbspIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. She saw her uncle’s legs blown off in the same airstrike that killed her father and destroyed most of their home in Beit Lahia, north Gaza.\u0026nbspLike many children in the tiny enclave, she suffered from post-traumatic stress.\u0026nbspThen Amjed Tantesh, 42, a swimming coach and one-time Olympic hopeful, encouraged her to learn to swim as a way of channelling her depression and anger.\u0026nbsp“A week after my dad passed away Amjed called my mum and offered me and my brother swimming lessons. My dad was killed by shrapnel from an airstrike which ricocheted off the wall and hit his heart. The same airstrike blew off my uncle’s leg. We were all downstairs screaming,” she said sitting by a small pool filled with murky green water in Gaza City.\u0026nbsp“It’s extremely important for me to achieve my dream, the dream of my family, of my coach, to be the first Gazan swimmer to take part in the Olympics,” she added.\u0026nbspFour years later, the fitness and football fanatic\u0026nbspspends her free time training in grubby and sometimes makeshift pools. Gaza is in the 11th year of an Israeli blockade, meaning Fatima cannot even get hold of proper swimming equipment. She is left to swim in a mismatched pair of pyjamas. If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles long.She said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger.\u0026nbsp“I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,”\u0026nbspshe said.\u0026nbspIn June Save the Children\u0026nbspreported that a staggering 95 per cent of children in Gaza had depression, consistent with deep psychological distress. The charity said the constant threat of conflict, the fear of bombs, and the constant insecurity caused by the unstable political situation had created a psychological crisis in the country.\u0026nbspMany fear Gaza is now on the brink of another war with Israel as tensions have reached boiling point.\u0026nbspOn Friday the Israeli army said one of its soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen near the border, the first Israeli military death near Gaza since the 2014 war. The army unleashed a tide of airstrikes that pummelled over 60 military targets in the enclave, in one of the most intense days of violence in four years.By the end of the day, the Gaza health ministry said that at least four Palestinians had been killed. As fires raged through the strip, a shaky truce brokered by Egypt was enforced. On Saturday, the United Nations urged both sides it was “imperative” to step back from the brink of a “devastating conflict”.At the heart of the latest eruption of hostilities is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests near the border fences that the Israeli army has met with force. More than 140 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire since 30 March, when residents of Gaza first marched on the fences demanding right to return to ancestral lands they were forced from during the 1948 war which surrounded the creation of Israel.\u0026nbspSome of the protesters have taken to launching burning kites and balloons attached with explosives at Israel, sparking more than 750 wildfires and scorching 2,600 hectares of land.The Palestinians maintain the protests are peaceful and Israel is firing on them with live ammunition. Israel says their soldiers have been attacked and the wildfires are endangering Israeli citizens.\u0026nbspEarlier this week saw the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza and Israel since the 2014 conflict. Egypt reportedly intervened to stop war breaking out.Amid the escalating conflict, children, like Fatima, have suffered the most.\u0026nbspMr Tantesh said there were few resources or outlets for the youth to deal with trauma, though\u0026nbspswimming had\u0026nbspproven\u0026nbspa cheap alternative.\u0026nbspHe launched his swimming initiative in 1999 and said he has since taught more than\u0026nbsp5,400 children to swim. \u0026nbspBecause he initially\u0026nbsplacked access to pools and so, in the aftermath of the 2014 war, Tantesh built a makeshift sea pool\u0026nbspby using concrete blocks from bombed-out buildings to cordon off an area of the beach in north Gaza, where the water is less polluted.\u0026nbspIn 2015 alone, he taught some 465 children, with most of them receiving free swimming lessons.\u0026nbsp“All of them are war afflicted, they have lost a father, mother, relative or they have had a house destroyed,” he told The Independent.“But our new ambition is to prepare some of those children to qualify for the Olympics. Fatima is by far our best chance, she has developed the fastest and so we hope she will represent Gaza in Tokyo 2020. I have never seen such determination and persistence,” he added.Meet the girl who wants to be Gaza’s first Olympic SwimmerFatima Abu Shedeg, 13, dreams of leaping from the blocks at Tokyo 2020Fatima has survived three wars and until four years ago she was not only unable to swim but had never been in a poolIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead.

Bar one person, a young judoka from Jerusalem who qualified in London’s 2012 Games, they have all competed on a wild card scheme.The Palestinian Olympic Committee chooses its teams from Gaza, the West Bank and Palestinian communities across the world. So Fatima will face stiff competition while she makes do with scant resources.Gaza lacks an Olympic-size swimming pool and the few pools it does have struggle to stay open amid chronic energy shortages. It is also increasingly dangerous to swim in the sea.\u0026nbspGaza’s environment authority said last year that nearly two-thirds of its 25 mile coastline was seriously polluted.\u0026nbspSewage treatment plants cannot function due to the power\u0026nbspshortages. The United Nations said that more than 100 million litres of waste water are pumped into the sea off Gaza every day.With filthy beaches and not enough electricity\u0026nbspto keep pools clean, trying to train a swimming team is near impossible, according to the Olympic Committee in Gaza.\u0026nbspIn a battered office and sat in front of a battery-powered fan, Munther Masalmeh, the committee’s secretary-general, said it would be a “major achievement” for a swimmer in Gaza to reach the Olympics.“There is not a single pool in Gaza that hits international standards. With our infrastructure problems it makes it even harder. It would be a major achievement to have a female swimmer here because of the lack of resources,” he told The Independent.The Israeli blockade also restricts access to sports equipment. Mr Masalmeh claimed even iron goal posts were banned because the Israelis feared\u0026nbspthey could be used to make weapons.“Sports equipment gets stuck in the ports for year and does not reach the athletes. In addition, the Israelis have in the past banned players from leaving Gaza to participate in international tournaments,” he added.Nonetheless, Fatima hopes one day to get permission to leave Gaza and take her place at the Games.“I want to achieve my dream to be picked for the Olympics, so I can travel and compete in the 100m race,” she said, putting on her swimming pyjamas.“I don’t just want to participate, I want to get first place,\u0026nbspso those who picked me are proud.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

And the impossibility of its own airlines avoiding UK airspace. It won’t happen.Varadkar must believe that these grenades he brainlessly lobs into the Brexit negotiations help Brussels. He is not bright enough to realise how absurd and unstatesmanlike he looks.But he let something else very revealing slip too.Varadkar reportedly said that EU leaders have assured him no hard border or customs checks will ever be needed between Ireland and Northern Ireland.That’s under ANY scenario, including a No Deal.Since we will never build a hard border either, why is “avoiding” one still being discussed, let alone a huge sticking point?Answer: It is a ruse, confected by a Brussels desperate to keep us in its grip.Eurocrats yesterday tore apart Theresa May’s Chequers offer. Yes, the same offer already so over-generous it almost collapsed her Government.The Sun has never been more gloomy about the chance of a deal. There is nothing more Mrs May can compromise on.But Brussels is run by deluded bullies who apparently think they cannot lose.Martin Selmayr, the German who is effectively in charge, dislikes Britain and insists any deal must be punitive.The EU, while apparently negotiating with us, is also advising its members how to lure away our job-creating firms.Parliament, and its Remainers, must not be cowed. They must back Britain over Brussels. No Deal wasn’t our choice. But the EU is pushing us into it and telling its members to be prepared.Within eight months we must be fully ready too, economically and politically.THE huge surge in serious crime shames the supposed party of law and order.It is no coincidence murders, rapes, robberies and knife attacks are soaring with police numbers at a 36-year low.For years the Tories considered their necessary cuts to budgets safe enough. The evidence against is now irrefutable.But more cash is not the only answer.Many forces are appallingly led, obsessed with their image, with social media virtue-signalling and investigations driven by political correctness, all while ignoring the basics of keeping the public and their property safe.Home Secretary Sajid Javid must secure more money and reverse this horrific trend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She would have let Charlotte run riot in her bedroom, trying on all her designer clothes and shoes and raiding her make-up bag.It’s so tragic that all of these happy times were not to be. When William saw all of his children come into the world, most especially baby Charlotte, he must have felt the loss of his mother even more keenly.Diana would have been there with her arms full of presents, and not just for the babies. There would have been thoughtful gifts for Kate and lots of hugs and happy tears.You can well picture her ­giving newlywed Harry a cheeky nudge and telling him to “get on with it” so she could have more grandchildren to spoil.I also think that if Diana had still been alive this sad situation between Meghan Markle and her dad would never have been allowed to turn so toxic.Diana would have seen this potential problem looming even before the engagement was announced and nipped it firmly in the bud.She would have insisted and ensured he was invited to the UK and would have dispensed shrewd and invaluable advice on how to deal with all of the hoopla surrounding the wedding. Diana learned the hard way how to deal with the media and palace officials. She was misquoted, manipulated and misunderstood during her time as a royal wife and knew all the pitfalls and how to avoid them.Skittish Meghan would have been soothed and calmed and all of the bad feeling among the Markle family would have surely evaporated.Diana would have advised Meghan’s dad on his wedding suit, helped him with his speech and rehearsed him walking down the aisle.She would have put this rather shy and ordinary man completely at ease.Rather than watching his daughter getting married on TV while cowering in a cheap bed and breakfast in the US, he would have been an integral part of the happiest day of her life.Instead, we have a constant stream of ill-advised interviews given by Thomas where he appears to have been ignored and abandoned and, whether it’s fair or not, Meghan seems increasingly cold-hearted.Photos yesterday of. him celebrating his 74th birthday alone with just a fast food takeaway for company don’t exactly help, whether they were staged again or not.A present, phone call or card from Meghan would have gone a long way to build bridges.It’s all turning a tawdry soap opera meaning commentators such as Sharon Osbourne will keep the pot boiling.Just this week she inferred Thomas has a drink problem and should get clean, ensuring more lurid headlines and bad feeling as he furiously has to deny all of the allegations.No one is coming out of this well and never has Princess Diana been more missed.Harry needs her wise counsel and William knows what an important part she could have played in the lives of his ­children.I know her sons will never really get over her death, but I do hope when William looks into his daughter’s beautiful eyes he is heartened to see a reflection of his mum rather than finding it ­unbearably sad.THE way BBC News treated Cliff Richard was utterly shameful and I’m not in the least surprised it lost its court case.The poor man went through years of hell and became a virtual recluse – and his physical and mental health was profoundly affected.At a time when he should have been enjoying the rewards of a lifetime’s graft, he was enduring sleepless nights and often crying in anguish on the kitchen floor.Many in the media have expressed fear and disquiet that any sort of Cliff’s Law will mean restrictions on newspapers, radio and TV, and this is indeed troubling.But the blame should be pointed firmly at those who thought it was a good idea to send a helicopter to film and report an OTT police raid on an innocent man.Seeing Cliff outside the courtroom this week looking extremely fragile and on the verge of tears was heartbreaking.Clearly the sunny, friendly, optimistic Peter Pan of Pop has gone for good and in his place is a haggard, careworn, wary victim.Before the court case, Cliff told me he doesn’t have photos taken with fans and their children any more.It was painful to see the hurt and mistrust in his eyes.He then revealed this week that his VIP status meant he was allowed to use the secret Wimbledon tunnel under Centre Court and Court No1 to bounce quickly between both venues and view as much tennis as possible.Cliff doesn’t do that any more, and never will, because the tunnel goes past the ball boys’ changing area and he doesn’t want to put himself in a situation where he could potentially be accused of something unspeakable.I really hope that when enough time has passed he can get some of that old “glass half full” spirit back, but he will never be the person he was.And no one else should have to go through such a hideous ordeal when they have done nothing wrong.IF you don’t want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, cry and come out singing Abba songs, we can’t be friends.I thoroughly enjoyed Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again – a rare example of a sequel that is better than the original.The starry cast includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, PIerce Brosnan, Andy Garcia and Colin Firth. But the cherry on the icing on the cheesecake is the legend that is Cher.I was lucky enough to host the world premiere this week in London and had the chance to talk to the cast, who were effusive in their praise of Her Cherness.It was surprising to hear she STILL gets nervous before going on set and she was genuinely bewildered by all the love in the air for her.I thought one elderly gay gentleman was going to explode with happiness when Cher blew him a kiss.It was so endearing – and there is nothing more deliciously camp than Cher stepping out of a helicopter in a blonde wig and sequins before going on to sing Super Trouper. She’s a class act and a throughly lovely woman.WATCHING politicians squabble like ferrets in a sack soon loses its novelty value – and our eyes are now glazing over whenever the dreaded subject of Brexit rears its ugly head.But we should never forget that when we woke up the day after the referendum – to discover a majority had voted to leave the EU – there was NO actual plan.Bupkis. Nada. Zilch. Diddly-squat.There wasn’t even a “to do” list.Instead, all the rats deserted the sinking ship, claiming the dog had eaten their homework or a big boy did it and ran away – leaving the (female) PM to tidy up their reeking mess. Funny that.No matter which way you voted, surely we can all agree on one thing.There was little or no thought put into how to actually implement such a seismic change. Not even a few notes on the back of a fag packet.Now, two years down the line, the whole big, fat mess is farcical and beyond parody.As a nation, we are a laughing stock.Shame on all those careerists and fence-sitters for their arrogance, stupidity and downright mendacity in not having even a half-arsed plan in place.A parcel of rogues, right enough.IF you fancy a right good laugh at some silly, bonkers, hilarious fun and games, tune in to BBC1 today at 5.05pm for another helping of Wedding Day Winners with myself and Rob Beckett.One couple will actually get married at the end of the show and it’s all very lighthearted and joyful.DID Burberry REALLY need to make a bonfire of its overpriced designer swag and burn an eye-watering £28million worth of clothing and cosmetics?In line with other designer labels, the fashion house claims the move was to stop counterfeiters getting their hands on garments and using them to produce fakes.But surely that just doesn’t add up.If criminals want to reproduce any designer clothes or handbags, they can go into any shop and purchase something – or, even simpler, just order it online.Could Burberry not instead have the mother of all sales in aid of Help for Heroes, or for the homeless charity Centrepoint, or any number of deserving causes here and in the Third World?That £28million would have gone a hell of a long way to help those in need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV. Like Mary Beard.”David added that he would only be hired now: “If I had tombstone teeth and rather funny hair and made a lot of noise about that fact.”Oh dear.Where even to start? When you resort to attacking someone’s appearance, you are in trouble.It’s not Mary Beard that has held back his career.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club. All the time.Theresa May has the leadership skills of a damp dishcloth, no authority and no political vision.A strong leader needs a clear mission. You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not asking for more than that. They are still my family and I’d like to see them again.“Growing up we saw them loads and I have so many happy memories of playing at their house, doing Easter egg hunts and playing on quad bikes.“Then suddenly it all stopped and I am on the outside looking in, only seeing them live their lives on Instagram or on the TV.”The teen has been reminiscing about the time he played with Becks and Cruz at Rowneybury House in Hertfordshire.He also remembers the time David bought him a McDonald’s Happy Meal when he was a kid.And despite growing up with Brooklyn, their lives could not be more different as Freddie has just £1.36 in his bank.Freddie’s first job was at Romford Market, where he worked on a noodle stall earning £200 a month.Brooklyn, however, recently took home £100,000 for a photo shoot he did for phone company Huawei.He is forced to ride a mountain bike because he can’t afford driving lessons while his famous cousin drives a £35,000 Land Rover.Freddie last saw Becks, 43, nine years at a Chinese restaurant in Harlow, Essex, and in 2012 he went for a meal at Pizza Express with his cousins and Victoria, 44."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004213215801.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"united utilities hosepipe ban shareholders pay","story":"Despite being under fire for limiting water usage to 7m homes in the north west of England as its reservoirs run dry, the firm will dish out its largest payout in a decade.The company has blamed the lack of rainfall for its dry reservoirs despite being the only firm in England and Wales to impose a hosepipe ban.But it was recently revealed to lose more than 400 million litres of water every day from leaks, and has turned to sniffer dogs to detect pipe faults.Meanwhile, United Utilities boss Steve Mogford earned £2.3m in 2017.Jim McMahon, the Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton, said: “This isn’t just about water leaking out but money which should be used to maintain the water network leaking out as quickly.The first and last responsibility of the water company should be about maintaining the supply, and it has failed.”A spokesman for water regulation authority, Ofwat, said: The decisions some water companies have made on dividends, financial structures and top executive pay have damaged customer trust.Through measures we announced earlier this month, we are strengthening the incentive on companies to improve their performance for customers and cutting the rewards that come from financial engineering.United Utilities was fined £8m for under-performance last year. It said the payouts were in line with retail price inflation and its five-year growth policy.A spokesman said: “We deliver a range of benefits and long-term value for customers, the environment, and shareholders.Between 2015 and 2020 , we are investing over £3.5bn in essential infrastructure.”Thames Water last month announced it would halt bonuses to bosses this year and suspend dividend payments to its shareholders.The ban means customers will not be allowed to use either a hosepipe or sprinkler to water their gardens.They were also told not to fill up paddling pools, or face fines of up to £1,000.A statement added: Please use a watering can instead or, even better, reuse any water from the home such as water from washing up bowls or bath water.We know hosepipe bans can be inconvenient but by taking these steps now we can make sure we have enough water for more essential things like drinking, washing and cooking.The North West is the second region facing a hosepipe ban after Northern Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CAr2.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"newborn baby left hot car tesco newton abbott devon car park","story":"The disturbing footage sparked fury online after an eyewitness heard the baby crying in a supermarket car park.The car was spotted in the car park of Tesco in Newton Abbot on Thursday, when temperatures reached around 26 degrees.A man recording the cries is heard to say the baby is screaming its head off and that it was outrageous and out of order.According to a report on Devon Live supermarket staff issued an urgent shop broadcast when they were informed of the baby in the car by a member of the public.A Tesco spokesman said: A customer told one of our colleagues that a young child had been left on their own in a parked car at our Newton Abbot store.We put out a call in store for the vehicle’s driver, and they returned to their car.Commenting on the incident on social media, one person confirmed it was the grandfather who had left the baby in the car and the parents were now aware of it.Writing online, some said it was horrendous and  disgusting.Meanwhile, the British Red Cross issued a warning urging everyone to take care in the soaring temperatures last month."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000420507531-e1532289114854.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cosplay anime kawaii hyper japan","story":"We pass a killer whale sitting on a stone and a wounded Japanese warrior wiping blood off his Samurai sword.A panther slinks by as twirling princesses twist magic lamps above their crystal-encrusted veils. They pause and gawk at my blue bob, fruity tutu and 7in platforms.It may sound like the set of a fantasy film but I am in fact just one of the 80,000 wig-wearing guests at Hyper Japan Festival in London to celebrate Cosplay — costume role play — and Japanese culture.Youngsters from across the UK are dressed as their favourite characters from anime — a type of animation featuring futuristic heroes in action-led stories — as well as from cartoons, video games and comic books. Even the odd US comic supervillain is wandering round.All have been warned to not wear outfits smaller than a swimsuit as it is a “family event”.One of the first to greet me is Efe Aighorr, 28, a digital director from Canada Water, South East London, who has more than 45,000 followers on Instagram.He is dressed as Golden Jaguar from Marvel’s Black Panther. He says: “I’ve been doing it for two-and-a-half years and love it. I have a serious job so it’s great to morph into a different person and have fun.”But it was not known as Cosplay until 1983, when it was used by film director Nobuyuki Takahashi in Japanese magazine My Anime.The doll-like Kawaii style is common here among young British girls — and is the one I have opted for.As Princess Fairy Kei, I have blue hair, fake eyelashes, pink eyeshadow and am in a pastel dress adorned with cartoon ice creams.Another popular choice is Lolita fashion, a street style inspired by Victorian dolls. Fans include pop stars Gwen Stefani, Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj.All this does not come cheap. I meet impeccably dressed Sade Kaye, 20, a student, from Stratford, East London, who has “blown” £10,000 on her neon-heavy Harajuku street style, which originates from the Tokyo district it is named after.She says: “It’s an expensive addiction. I used to spend £1,000 a month on clothes. At the time I was working in a call centre and taking home around £1,500 a month.“I live at home so saw it as disposable income but just wasted it on outfits. I buy some I don’t even need.”She adds: “I once had an interview at a stationery shop. They were gobsmacked when I rocked up in silver space boots, a mini skirt and crop top.”A job is not the only thing she struggled to get. Sade’s look is stopping her from getting a boyfriend too, as “a lot of guys look and think I’m crazy”. But she admits she would “rather have amazing clothes”.She is in the right place. An entire floor is devoted to exhibitors hawking schoolgirl outfits, maid uniforms and other cute dresses, along with wigs, accessories and make-up. There are also craft shops where designers teach new Cosplayers how to make their own outfits.I run into London street performer Matt Johnson, 35, who is dressed as a Japanese warrior, and later Tabitha Hastie, 27, a software developer from Canada Water.Her outfit, inspired by Mercy from the Overwatch video game, cost £200. She has another which cost £500. She says: “I dread to think how much I’ve spent. But I love the whole experience and feeling part of a community, so it is worth it.”60% are aged between 23 and 3940% of Cosplayers are male£300 the amount most would spend on a costume It is easy to forget that away from Hyper Japan, these are all normal people with normal jobs.Laura Johnston, 26, is a civil servant. But today she is Morrigan, from computer game Dragon Age.She says: “I wear office attire to work but as soon as I’m home I dress only in Cosplay. My fiance doesn’t understand it. He doesn’t know it yet but I’m going to take weapons to our wedding.”Cosplaying for confidence and escapism are common themes.Emma Langley Soryu, 27, a warehouse worker from Birmingham, is dressed as Asuka, from Nineties’ Japanese TV series Neon Genesis Evangelion. She tells me how she is quite shy but “gets to be a different person in my costume”.With the compliments and selfie requests rolling in for me as I walk round, it is easy to see why Cosplaying is so addictive.Saya Elyn, 29, an accountant who has flown from Belgium to be here, says: “It makes me feel special. I like creating costumes and being someone else, as my job is so boring.“It’s a great way to make new friends. Everyone is so supportive and guys really like it, too. I even Crossplay, which means I dress as a man and become one of them.”Upstairs, a fashion show is beginning. A long queue of Cosplayers and Kawaii girls wait backstage, keen to show off their over-the-top costumes.Essex student Shannon Gallagher, 22, Harriet Day, 22, a pharmacy assistant, and Jade Mogford, 23, a waitress, are turning heads in their Arabian princess outfits. Each have tailored theirs to match their favourite anime.Shannon says: “We love dressing up and have hundreds of amazing outfits. We are getting stopped for a lot of pictures today, it’s great people love our outfits so much.”Like others I have spoken to, the three girls are single — a common theme. Perhaps it is because the scene can be hard to understand as an outsider.Kawaii girl Jess Redman, a single 24-year-old customer service worker from Bristol, says: “Sometimes people love it and say you look great and other times people look terrified and run away.”Yet there is a more sinister side to Cosplay. A 15-year-old female guest tells me: “People think they can touch you and lift up your skirt. It can be scary if you’re by yourself.“They see Lolita as a sexual thing but that’s because some people try to turn it into a fetish. Those people aren’t welcome in the community.”But not all the youngsters I spoke to had a problem with Lolita being perceived as sexual.Emma Barnes, 20, a student, started adopting the style when she was 12, as it “made me feel confident and sexy”.She adds: “I was an outcast in school, no one looked at me. But when I’m in my cute Kawaii costume I feel like a million dollars.”I can vouch for the fact that getting all dressed up makes you feel special, but after eight hours my feet are killing me, I am sweating under my wig and my body is aching under the heavy outfit.Now, where are my Primark PJs?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the payments if youre part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £348 if youre single, £464 if youre part of a couple or £812 if you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, even if you stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Payments if your payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has admitted there are problems with the system but is determined to continue with the rollout.A spokesperson from the DWP said: Universal credit is a flexible and responsive benefit and we continue to listen to feedback and make any necessary improvements during the rollout with our test-and-learn approach.We are committed to ensuring people get the help they need and the majority of staff say universal credit gives them greater flexibility to give people the right support.

Jonathan Bryan is on a campaign to change people\u0027s perceptions about disability after he was continually underestimated by the education system. Jonathan, who communicates by moving his eyes, has a message that he wants people to hear -never underestimate us. But, despite his bravery, he has had huge hurdles to overcome in his short life.  Mum Chantal, who has been instrumental in fighting for him to have the opportunities he deserves, said that she was unprepared for the level of discrimination he has face. She said that the discrimination he\u0027s faced has been some of the hardest things to overcome.  Lots of people look at Jonathan and because his body doesn’t work very well, they assume his mind doesn’t too, she said. Jonathan entered the special education system with the label Profound and Multiple Learning Difficulties (PMLD), as a result he was given a largely sensory curriculum (focused on stimulating the senses). Chantal explained: He did lots of different activities at school, but had no formal literacy teaching.  She said that he was acutely aware that people were talking to him differently. Jonathan describes being talked to in “special” a mixture of the voice reserved for a baby mixed with how you talk to a foreigner with little understanding: slow, loud and clear with short sentence, she said. People often assumed that he would not understand if they talked to him normally. When he was seven Chantal decided to keep him at home for a few hours everyday to teach him to read and write. After a year and a half it got to the stage where he was able to say everything he wanted to using an alphabet board.  Jonathan describes “speaking” for the first time saying “I felt like a bird let out of its cage.” His mum said: When recovering from a serious illness a year after starting to spell in 2016, Jonathan said he had been given extra time to be a \u0027voice for the voiceless\u0027, and began campaigning for all children to be given the opportunity to learn to read, write and spell, regardless of their educational label.  Since then he has gone on to set up a charity to challenge educational assumptions and write and publish his memoir, Eye Can Write, ( http://bit.ly/EyeCanWrite ) with his proceeds going to his charity, Teach Us Too ( www.teachustoo.org.uk ).  The strong-willed youngster is keen to share his important message: “Never underestimate us, teach us to read and write.”  He and mum Chantal are working with the Department For International Development to spread that message. She said: Jonathan’s journey has not been an easy one, and as his mother it has often felt a lonely one. But in many countries in the world the stigma that people face is even more acute and there is far less support available.  Chantal and Jonathan are supporting the UK Government’s first-ever Global Disability Summit in London to galvanise the global effort to transform the lives of people with disabilities.  International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said: For too long many people with disabilities in the world’s poorest countries have not been able to fulfil their potential due to stigma or a lack of practical support.

Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to the Brexit Secretary during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening. Tory Dominic Raab is said to have been told the doomsday scenario was part of the warehouse giant\u0027s planning for leaving the EU without a deal. A source revealed the comment to the Times, saying: People seem to feel marginally more positive than when they went in. Let’s hope so, given that one of the people there with a significant supply chain had civil unrest within two weeks in their no-deal planning.”  Questioned by the Mirror, Amazon did not deny the comment was made. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, even if those scenarios are very unlikely. It comes just days after the government stepped up plans for a No Deal Brexit as 12 weeks tick down to Britain needing a deal in October.  Asked if the Amazon boss was right to warn about civic unrest, Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s deputy spokeswoman said: We\u0027ve been clear that we expect to agree a mutually beneficial deal given all the progress we\u0027ve made so far that is by far the most likely outcome. The spokeswoman added: Where is the evidence to suggest that would happen?  Today Theresa May will grapple with her battling Cabinet as she sweeps her top Tories to an away day in Gateshead. In a bid to give ministers a break from Brexit, she will also announce a \u0026pound780m infrastructure investment in the East Coast rail line. But she faces other Brexit doomsday warnings - including that food safety controls could have to be suspended to stop Brits going hungry.  Yesterday pro-EU Tory Dominic Grieve warned No Deal will prompt a state of emergency - as Mr Raab refused to deny Britain plans to stockpile food. Mr Raab, who was made Brexit Secretary just two weeks ago, also refused to deny the M26 motorway could be turned into a lorry park to deal with a blockage at UK ports. Mr Raab insisted Britain was still preparing for No Deal. And a German minister today signalled Brussels will push Britain to make its Brexit plan even softer - risking a revolt by Tory Brexiteers.

Dame Margaret - who faces investigation for branding Mr Corbyn an anti-Semite to his face - insisted many shared that view of the Labour leader. Today her lawyers wrote to Labour\u0027s general secretary, accusing party chiefs of a veiled attempt to silence her and branding the probe into her conduct sloppy, baseless and ill-thought-out. And she warned she\u0027d been branded a Zionist bitch who was under the orders of my paymaster in Israel by trolls ahead of tonight\u0027s showdown. The row began when Labour\u0027s ruling NEC failed to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism.  Jeremy Corbyn insisted party chiefs had accepted almost all of it while Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow solicitor general, said parts of Labour\u0027s approach were much stronger.    But some Labour MPs are expected to back the full IHRA code tonight at the last meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party before their summer break.  Labour MPs Louise Ellman and Ruth Smeeth are expected to move a motion backing the full code, followed by a debate. A vote would only be held on the first day back after the recess in September. Labour officials were refusing to say this morning whether Mr Corbyn would attend tonight\u0027s PLP meeting. Sources including MPs did not expect him to show up. It came as Dame Margaret\u0027s lawyers Mishcon de Reya wrote to Labour\u0027s general secretary Jennie Formby today - blasting the hasty, sloppy, baseless and ill-thought-out investigation into her conduct. Party chiefs wrote to Dame Margaret last week, the day after her outburst, saying she was being probed for an alleged beach of Labour\u0027s Rule 2.1.8 - which says no member should behave in a way that\u0027s grossly detrimental to the party. The party letter warned: You should be aware that any future behaviour of a similar nature to the allegation above could result in further disciplinary action, including the possibility of administrative suspension while the matter is investigated.  But Dame Margaret\u0027s lawyers\u0027 letter, seen by the Mirror, says the exact rule the MP is accused of breaking hasn\u0027t been specified, and threats to suspend her if she repeats it appear to be a veiled attempt to silence her. The letter adds: It is a fundamental breach of natural justice and principles of fairness. You have left our client in the bizarre position whereby possible suspension is hanging over her for future unspecified behaviour. The letter - which sets a deadline of 4pm on Wednesday for a response - also says Dame Margaret vehemently denied swearing at the Labour leader during their confrontation. Labour\u0027s code explicitly endorses the IHRA\u0027s working definition of anti-Semitism and includes a list of behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic copied word-for-word from the international organisation\u0027s own document. But it omits four examples from the IHRA list:   Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel\u0027s existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis.  Labour insisted that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered in the new code. Yet Dame Margaret said Labour\u0027s code meant people can call be a Zionist bitch and not be disciplined.  Today Dame Margaret said by refusing to adopt the IHRA definition in full, Mr Corbyn had put himself in a position where he’s perceived by many to be anti-Semitic.  She compared his claims to be taking action to people who say I’m not a racist but - adding people have to be judged on their actions and not their words. Dame Margaret, who fought and won against the BNP in Barking, compared the swift response to her outburst to how long it had taken to discipline people accused of anti-Semitism in the party. Last night Labour’s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, joined calls for the party to adopt the IHRA definition in full. But she said she doubted Dame Margaret would be rebuked. Baroness Smith said: Jeremy’s not exactly somebody who’s not used to harsh words on that.

Here are some bike-focused ideas to keep everyone busy\u0026nbspShareByHolly Thatcher15:25, 20 JUL 2018Updated10:56, 23 JUL 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShareGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFive seconds after breakfast on the first day of the school holidays, you just know that you\u0027ll hear the words I\u0027m bored from the little ones. So you\u0027ll need to have a few ideas up your sleeve to get through the next six weeks. The best way to keep everyone happy is to get outside as a family and enjoy nature and each other\u0027s company. So we\u0027ve teamed up with Halfords and put together some ideas for summer activities that are centered around bikes. Hop on, we\u0027re going for a ride!  1) Teach little ones to ride   The gift of cycling lasts a lifetime. Early teens will love the freedom a bike offers and smaller children love the time they get to spend with you. Getting them confident on a bike from an early age will enthuse them about cycling. There\u0027s currently up to 30 per cent off bikes and accessories in the Halfords big summer cycling sale, so there\u0027s no time like the present to get started. A balance bike is great for mastering the basics. Little ones can learn braking and balance skills and before you know it they\u0027ll be ready to graduate to a proper bike, without the need for stabilisers.   Halfords has bikes for all ages, but check out the starter bikes like the Apollo Wizzer Balance Bike (\u0026pound50, save \u0026pound5). This bike provides a smooth ride and is easy to control, and has a hand brake so they don\u0027t have to stop with their feet. It also has an adjustable saddle height and pneumatic tyres providing full grip.   2) Parks   There\u0027s nothing like a park in the summer to make you appreciate the beauty of nature. Government statistics suggest that 37 million of us use them each year and the UK has an estimated 27,000 public parks,* so you shouldn\u0027t be short of choice. Parks are also a great location to teach your child to ride a bike, so our first suggestion is that you grab the kids and take a trip to a park near you.  Check out Sustrans’ site for more details about routes through parks. Many have traffic free routes that are suitable for all the family.      3) An even bigger park!  As well as the local parks you\u0027ll find in almost every town, city or village in the UK there are also amazing national parks, 15 in fact, across the UK. England has 10, Scotland two and Wales has three. These areas are spectacular places to visit on a bike and are the perfect place to teach children how to ride. There\u0027s up to 30% off bikes and accessories in the Halfords Big Summer Cycling Sale.   Places like Whinlatter Forest in the Lake District and the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire lend themselves to mountain biking. You can cycle on bridleways (look for the signs, or check online before you set off). Pack a light lunch and the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket, currently half price at \u0026pound10, and you\u0027re ready to picnic anywhere.      4) See something new   There’s lots of amazing sights to see on a bike, so have a look around for either a local spot or something a bit more far-flung. Consider places like Brighton Pavilion, which is built in Indo-Saracenic style, or head to Wales for Lake Vyrnwy\u0027s Gothic revival straining tower (it filters the reservoir water before it is sent on for purification).  If you want to find amazing places in the UK then check out the national tourist sites for England , Wales and Scotland . Match those up with some of the great routes on Sustrans and you\u0027ll have a smashing holiday enjoying scenery from around the UK.    If you don’t already have a bike rack for your car, then the Thule ProRide 591 is a great choice at just \u0026pound85 (save \u0026pound25). And if you\u0027re not sure where you need to drive to, the TomTom GO 5200 will help ensure it\u0027s a hassle free journey. It offers lifetime map updates and has amazing features like Wi-Fi and a built-in SIM and you\u0027ll get free traffic update over the internet too, for the life of the device. It\u0027s just \u0026pound202.49, save \u0026pound97.50.   5) Hit an off road trail   There\u0027s no better way to escape the daily grind than by heading to the country and taking your bike offroad. Lots of areas of woodland have off-road tracks for mountain bikers and they usually offer a variety of distances and are designed for all types of skill levels, so it shouldn’t be too intimidating.  Swinley Forest in Berkshire and Dunkeld Mountain Bike Trails, Scotland along with many, many more places across the UK offer trails for beginners and experts alike. Check Sustrans for ideas, or search online for beginner mountain biking.    There\u0027s no doubt you\u0027ll find off road biking exhilarating, so if you don\u0027t have a mountain bike already then consider the Carrera Sulcata Mountain Bike from Halfords, now just \u0026pound297 (save \u0026pound128).   6) Plan a big trip   Get your kids excited about a big trip somewhere on your bikes. Perhaps something you do as a family holiday during the summer break. But before then it\u0027s worth building up to it with some weekend rides. This will be helpful to learn what everyone\u0027s ability is and plan the routes you take on your big holiday. So start small with some routes around your neighbourhood. Make sure all the bikes are in good condition and that everything on them works as it should.  If you\u0027re unsure, book a Free Bike Check where a Halfords expert will perform 32 point inspection on your bike, giving you complete confidence without having to get your hands dirty. The inspection includes:   Frame, saddle \u0026amp handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables  If they spot anything that needs attention, they can fix it too. Once you\u0027ve got everyone excited it\u0027s time to plan the big adventure. Check out Sustrans for help planning routes and organisations like the Camping and Caravanning Club can help you track down places to stay nearby.  If you\u0027re going to drive to your destination, make sure you get a FREE Halfords Car Check which includes:   Bulb Check Wiper Blades Check Battery Check  Engine oil level check   Air conditioning check  Windscreen Chip Check Plus Free Screenwash Top Up  Book online at halfords or visit a store - there\u0027s no appointment necessary.  7) Cycle and camp  One lovely way to spend a weekend is to locate a campsite near some good cycling routes. Set up camp and each day head off for a new cycling experience. Sustrans has loads of routes in the National cycle Network all across the UK so you won\u0027t struggle to find something to ride along, no matter where you stay.   Once you\u0027ve got a base camp set up you should be able to put together some decent lunches. Take a Halfords 40L Coolbox to keep food cool at the campsite (it runs on mains power, or from a car supply, but check if your campsite has power hookups) - it\u0027s \u0026pound85 (save \u0026pound25).      8) Take your toddler out       One of the nicest things you can do with very small children is to take them for a ride in a bike trailer - like the Halfords Double Child Bike Trailer , currently better than half price at just \u0026pound100 (save \u0026pound120). Don\u0027t worry, they\u0027ll be in safe and secure in tow behind you in this comfortable buggy. Safety and security is increased by the high visibility flag, safety harness, bug screen and rain shield.  Enjoy a relaxed riding experience with your children taking in all the sights and sounds together. They\u0027ll love the downhill parts - and will heckle you in the uphill sections!  Taking a little one out on a bike also means that you can get older kids out at the same time. No need to leave anyone at home, making for a wonderful family day out. Don\u0027t forget helmets for all, also available at Halfords.   9) Do something for charity  "},{"url":null,"title":"couple foster teen just seven","story":"NewsCouple, 22, foster teen just seven years younger than them - and she agrees to play very special role at their weddingSally-Ann and Ryan Jones from Warwickshire were both 22 when they made the huge decision to become foster carers\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByFionnula Hainey22:38, 22 JUL 2018Updated12:55, 23 JUL 2018NewsSally-Ann and Ryan who were both 22 when they took in the 15-year-old (Image: Coventry Live WS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A couple who fostered a teenager just seven years younger than them feel they have found their \u0027calling in life.\u0027   Sally-Ann and Ryan Jones from Warwickshire were both 22 when they made the huge decision to become foster carers.   They felt ready despite being so young and decided to foster before having children of their own, reports Coventry Live.   Sally-Ann, who had previously worked in early education , initially thought she would foster a child under seven, but was delighted to welcome a 15-year-old into her family.  At first, we were a little nervous about what to expect and how the match would work, Sally-Ann said. Would she respect us as carers, would we get the balance between understanding her and parenting right?  Fortunately, other than a few minor challenges expected with parenting a teenager, the placement was very successful and she fitted really well into our family. We found that people would just assume that she was our family member or a friend, which helped when transporting her to social activities with friends and to school, as she preferred to keep her peers from knowing that she was in foster care. One of the most special moments for the young couple was when their foster daughter agreed to be their bridesmaid at their wedding last year. We felt so honoured that she agreed to play such a key role on our special day after only living with us for just a few months, Sally-Ann said. After around two years together, at the age of 17, the girl moved out to live independently, but Sally-Ann and Ryan have had a number of other placements since, all between the ages of seven and 15.

Dr Michael Porter developed sepsis after infection spread from a cut in his hand he got from a nail on a garden gate.  The blood poisoning was spreading through his body fogging his judgment in seeking urgent medical treatment.  But his brother Martin spotted the warning signs and rushed him to hospital.  Dr Porter slipped into a coma and his family feared the worst. But the 45-year-old fought his way back to health and is now raising awareness of what people should do if they suspect someone has sepsis. Dr Porter, a lecturer in molecular genetics, was visiting his family in Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, when he became ill. He said: Two days earlier I had been repairing the lock on my garden gate, when I scratched my hand on a nail. The University of Central Lancashire lecturer added: By the time I arrived in Glasgow I was feeling unwell, but I didn\u0027t know just how ill I really was. I was fevered, exhausted and must have come over slightly confused. All warning signs of sepsis. My armpit was also sore which I now realise was caused by the sepsis killing the muscles in my arm, in a process called necrotising myositis. The sepsis was spreading through my body from the cut and was impacting on my judgment on spotting the symptoms.  His brother Martin, an NHS consultant, took him to hospital and asked the most important question. He got me into a car and rushed me and my wife, Nicola, to Hairmyres Hospital, four miles away, said Dr Porter. “In A\u0026ampE he asked the vital question, ‘Could it be sepsis?\u0027 That triggered a series of tests and treatments. It included immediate intravenous antibiotics to give me any chance of survival. There was no time to lose in trying to stop the runaway train of sepsis which was threatening to kill me. Dr Porter deteriorated so badly he slipped into a coma, which lasted three months. Nicola and the rest of his family were told he probably would not last the night. But he held on, despite having to be resuscitated several times over the next two weeks. Nicola and Martin and Michael\u0027s parents, Linda and Joe, could only watch from his bedside in ICU as his body failed. In a desperate bid to keep his vital organs working, medics hooked him up to artificial respiration and kidney dialysis.  His face and body were almost hidden by the network of wires and tubes keeping him alive. I remember vivid dreams in which I was willing myself to live, he said. I didn\u0027t want to leave my family. I didn\u0027t want to die. I was vaguely aware of what was going on around me but unable to emerge from the coma. I was so ill, my parents were considering arrangements for my funeral. All hope seemed to be lost. Nicola, 35, a university administrator, said: Michael was so ill that some of the nurses could barely make eye contact. Others were advising us that he was most likely going to die. We had only been married three years and I thought I would lose him. When Dr Porter emerged from the coma, he could hardly walk and his weight had fallen from 12 stone to seven. Most of his muscles had faded and he had to learn to walk again with the help of physiotherapists. But he fought his way back to health over a period of nine months. And shortly after, he returned to his university post.

The unnamed Reddit user decided to use the Google Street View mode in Google Maps to walk through the streets when he spotted two ladies near a building. Wanting to get a closer look, he zoomed in and changed the angle at which he was looking at them. But it seems Google\u0027s Street View car captured a lot more than an innocent image of two holidaymakers. Bizarrely, the up-close image appears to show that one of the girls has a third leg. A third limb with toes can be seen sticking out from the shorts of the blonde girl on the right.  Users immediately dubbed the three-legged tourist mutant girl. But all may not be as it seems, with many pointing out the third leg is actually just a glitch on the Google system.

Most water companies have advised customers to conserve water but some firms will introduce or continue with usage restrictions. United Utilities said the measure will be introduced to customers in the North West of England on August 5. The ban comes despite recent rainfall as the heatwave looks set to continue until at least the end of the month. Water services director Martin Padley said: “Reservoir levels are still lower than we would expect at this time of year. “It is not a decision we have taken lightly.”  United Utilities has seven million customers in the North West. It will apply to all residential customers except in Carlisle and the north Eden Valley, where supplies remain reasonable. Bosses hope it will reduce water usage by 5-10%, or 100 million litres per day. A hosepipe ban also remains in place in Northern Ireland despite significant rainfall on Sunday.  Despite 17mm falling in the village of Portglenone, Co. Antrim within a 24-hour period, daily water usage remains more than 60 million litres (11.3%) above what is normally required during the July holidays. NI Water said: Demand on our plants normally drops over the holiday period to around 530m litres a day, but over July 13 and 14 this year our plants were producing approximately 590m litres each day. There was an initial drop in demand after the hosepipe ban was introduced in June. However, with another warm spell on the way the ban will remain in place for the foreseeable future. The temporary ban makes it illegal for people to uses hosepipes or sprinklers. It also means people are not allowed to fill paddling or swimming pools, hose their lawn or clean cars, paths or patios with a hose. However, householders are still allowed to use a watering can to water their plants and a bucket and sponge to wash their cars. Thames Water told The Express said that running a hosepipe for an hour would use, on average, the same amount of water used by a family of four in an entire day. Those who breach the hosepipe ban could face a fine of \u0026pound1,000. In an effort to conserve water, people have been asked to use recycled water from bath tubs or from buckets outside which capture any rainfall in their gardens or to wash their cars. As the heat wave continues, people are also being encouraged to have showers rather than baths.  At the end of June, Southern Water asked customers to make sure their showers last no longer than four minutes. As part of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, utility companies can now limit any or all activities for as long as they think necessary. Other water firms in England and Wales say they have no plans to follow suit. Severn Trent Water, which serves the Midlands and mid-Wales, said reservoirs were in a “healthy position”. South Staffs Water, which supplies a million customers in the Midlands, had “no issues”. Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Bristol Water, Wessex Water, Welsh Water and Thames Water all said reservoir levels were where they should be.

Lindsay Taylor, 33, moved in with her ex after she and her husband suddenly became homeless. When Lindsay and new love, Mike Taylor, 50, suddenly became homeless, her open minded former husband Chris Kelley, 46, suggested they all move in together. Mum-of-four Lindsay describes it as “a very modern family” - and the two men now get on like a house on fire. She met Mike shortly after her daughter Joanna, now two, was born.  Knowing her marriage to Chris was over, Lindsay began divorce proceedings in 2016 but the couple remained on good terms. In July last year, Mike and Lindsay tied the knot in a beach ceremony, when she was pregnant with baby Harrison, now aged five months. Chris looked after their children, Joanna, and Lucas, five, who suffers from a rare immunodeficiency disorder, chronic granulomatous disease or CGD. Lucas’ stepsister Rachel, 17, who Lindsay gave birth to as a teenager, is finishing her final year of high school at home. Lindsay moved back in with her mum and began seeing Mike and soon they decided to move in together. But when they were evicted because the landlord was renting to them illegally, Chris suggested they all move into his five-bed house in Connecticut, USA.  Lindsay said: “We started to look for another place, but Chris made a suggestion that no-one was expecting. “He said: \u0027Why don\u0027t you both move in with me? We can pay one mortgage, one set of bills and keep all the kids together?\u0027. “Chris is very open minded, so for him, this wasn’t a big deal at all – it just made sense.” Moving in with Chris also gave them both the chance to see their children every day. Lindsay added: “We were willing to do anything to keep the flow of our family going. “Mike found it quite hard. He’s more classic and not as ‘go with the flow’. “It took him a while to be comfortable in our blended home.”  The men quickly struck up a friendship and helped each other out with painting and decorating. Mike joked to Chris: I took your wife, the least I could do was paint your kitchen. In October last year, Lucas underwent a bone marrow transplant which it is hoped will regenerate his immune system and cure him of CGD. He needs to live in a semi-sterile environment, and the five-bed home the family share is ideal. Lindsay said: “Lucas is a complex kid that needs a village around him and this is what we’re doing. “It might seem a bit strange that I live with both my ex-husband and my husband, but it’s what we need to do to get through this as a family. “Lucas’ immune system is so fragile right now that we need to limit his exposure to the outside world, and this means as a family we need to do this as well. “We can go to the store and little things like that but we avoid large gatherings and restaurants where we can easily pick up infections and pass them on to Lucas. “It’s a big sacrifice that everyone is making but hopefully it will all be for the best when Lucas gets better.” Cinema manager Chris has taken leave from work to care for Lucas, while Lindsay extended her maternity leave from her job. Mike also took leave from work to dedicate his time to his family, including Destiny Taylor, 20, and Danny Taylor, 19, who live with their grandparents a few doors down. Lindsay explained: “It was during the end of my pregnancy with Joanna that mine and Chris\u0027 marriage began to break down.

Listeriosis symptoms are similar to the flu and can include vomiting, diarrhoea and a high temperature, but some cases can lead to severe complications including meningitis. The 220g coleslaw product - with use-by dates of 20/21/22/23 July - should be returned to the upmarket supermarket chain for a full refund.  Waitrose said no other products are known to be affected by the bug. It warned customers in a notice online and in stores: Waitrose is recalling the product as a precaution due to the potential presence of listeria. The product must not be consumed, but returned to Waitrose for a full refund. We apologise for the inconvenience caused. Waitrose and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) have both issued alerts to warn customers.   The FSA wrote on its website: Waitrose is recalling Crisp \u0026amp Creamy Deli Style Coleslaw Side Salad because listeria has been found in the product. No other Waitrose products are known to be affected. Symptoms caused by this organism can be similar to flu and include high temperature, muscle ache or pain, chills, feeling or being sick and diarrhoea. However, in rare cases, the infection can be more severe, causing serious complications, such as meningitis. Some people are more vulnerable to listeria infections, including those over 65 years of age, pregnant women and their unborn babies, babies less than one month old and people with weakened immune systems.

Genevieve Pascolla was getting some shut eye on the United Airlines flight from London to Chicago when she woke to find the man appearing to pleasure himself under a blanket. Terrified by what was happening, the 26-year-old raised the alarm with the woman sleeping beside her and informed the cabin crew. But what happened next left Genevieve appalled. She claims that after being given a new seat, the crew started making jokes and laughing about her ordeal - suggesting he was carrying out the sex act because of her. And shockingly she says the man was allowed to finish, with a child sitting close by.  Writing on social media, Genevieve said: They then started making jokes about the situation asking \u0027what perfume are you wearing\u0027 and excusing him saying \u0027he’s had a bit of wine\u0027. No one stopped him. He was allowed to finish, with a child sitting closely by. After exiting the plane first to talk to security, the security guard asked me if I’d like an apology from the offender. I immediately rejected the request. Genevieve has since shared a video of the man appearing to carry out the sex act, along with the email she received from United Airlines after she complained about what happened. In the email, sent to her by Lauren Michaels from customer care, it states Genevieve\u0027s request for a refund for the flight on June 4 has been refused and they are unable to offer goodwill compensation. It adds: Again, I apologise for the uncomfortable situation you experienced. I appreciate that you chose United for your travel. We hope your next trip with us will be a more positive experience.  In response Genevieve said: It took United Airlines a month an a half to respond to my complaint. And I received this email today. I am appalled at the lack of action taken in this situation in which as a woman, I was terrified. This man is clearly capable of much more. So women and men out there pick an airline that cares about your safety. Referring to being assaulted on one of your flight as a \u0027uncomfortable experience\u0027 is a bit of an understatement. Your lack of action is disgusting #metoo. Maddie King, a United Airlines spokesperson, told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the inappropriate and offensive conduct like this is exceedingly rare on their aircraft, but we have a protocol to ensure our customers’ safety because it is our top priority.

Or feel sudden and unexplained changes in temperature? Well, we don\u0027t mean to worry you, but according to paranormal investigators this might mean your house is haunted. Sorry. According to new research, six in ten people believe in ghosts and 23 per cent of us think there are spooky goings on in our homes. And it could actually end up costing people a huge amount of money, as more than half of us would be put off buying a property if the previous owner had reported paranormal activity. Experts Barri Ghai, Sandy Lakdar and Chris Fleming will be addressing the issue in a new TV show Help! My House is Haunted.  Ahead of the release, they\u0027ve shared a list of the ten things to look out for if you think your house might be haunted. They are:   Feeling of being watched when alone     Feeling a sudden and inexplicable change in temperature or a sudden static/electrical charge in the air     Household objects mysteriously disappearing and then reappearing in different places     Hearing unexplained whispers, footsteps, thuds or someone calling your name     Seeing shadows or movements out the corner of your eye     Frequent electrical problems such as lights inexplicably turning on or off, or appliances not working or acting up     Feeling of being touched by unseen hands     Unusual smells such as unexplained perfume scents, flowers, cigars, cigarettes, food or even the stench of death and decay     Waking up unexpectedly between 3am and 4am and sensing dread, fear or feeling like you\u0027re being watched    Feeling of grief or sadness in specific rooms or areas of the house  The research, which was carried out by leading statistician Dr Geoff Ellis to mark the release of the new show, found 39 per cent of people have reported seeing a ghost and 67 per cent claim they know someone who has. Bizarrely, 64 per cent of people believe their pets can see ghosts.  They team analysed the sale price of 25 British haunted houses that have been sold in the last 50 years and compared the sale prices to those of similar properties without any supernatural history.    The study revealed that well over half of the respondents (55 per cent) say they\u0027d be put off buying a haunted house, whilst 28 per cent of British property buyers have felt a spooky presence when viewing a house, which has put them off buying.

And for the inquisitive animals, it doesn\u0027t seem like a terrible life either - with plenty of room to run around in the glistening sunshine. The pigs have some famous neighbours in the luxurious Exumas - a stretch of 365 cays and islands in the Bahamas, where A-listers own private islands. They have a steady stream of food from adoring tourists who arrive on their uninhabited island by boat, as well as easy access to the cooling sea. But there are claims that \u0027Pig Island\u0027 is not as sunny as it may seem.  The pigs on Major Big Cay island - which are wild but have become used to human contact - have reportedly been seen sunburnt and covered in cuts. Visitors have claimed that excited tourists pick them up and make them do tricks, with some holidaymakers allegedly even feeding the creatures booze. There are also reports of the animals biting visitors - a sign that could mean they are stressed and upset, according to experts. Over the years, the pigs have become celebrities in their own right thanks to glitzy snaps posted on social media by tourists and stars. How they ended up on the island is a bit of a mystery.  Related video: Bella Thorne plays with the swimming pigs of the Bahamas   Some say they were left by a group of sailors, who planned to come back and cook them and others claim the pigs swam over from a shipwreck nearby. Other \u0027pig islands\u0027 have popped up as people have seen the huge amount of tourism Major Big Cay gets from the creatures. But as the animal\u0027s popularity has grown so too have fears over their treatment, with the pigs reportedly having been fed beer, rum and other alcohol. Last February, the island made headlines around the globe when at least seven pigs were found dead. An official investigation led by the government found in March that they had died due to ingesting sand. Kim Aranha, the President of the Bahamas Humane Society, last year called for the release of a report on the investigation.   Kim told Tribune 242 that local tour operators are respectful of the pigs, but that silly tourists showing up on other boats can cause harm to the animals.  I know there are a lot of silly sailors that go and feed them alcohol to try and get them drunk but that’s not to mistake them with the tour operators based out of Nassau who have treated them with excellent care, she said. Wayde Nixon, one of the owners responsible for the pigs, told the Nassau  that he blamed tourism for the lost pigs. “[Tourism] is blowing out of proportion,” he previously said. “Anybody [can bring] food there …. We have people giving the pigs beer, rum … all kinds of stuff.   Blogger Michelle Cehn said she was horrified at what she saw when she visited the island during her honeymoon recently.  She claimed she found hungry hordes of pigs and ten to 15 little piglets, many with cuts and wounds all over their bodies. I started to worry that all of these pigs were suffering from severe burns from being exposed to the strong Caribbean sunshine day after day, she said. Most of the tourists I saw there were not aware of any safety precautions they should take when interacting with the pigs. And the things I saw them do for the sake of a photo were cringeworthy. It’s amazing there are not already stories circling about serious injuries at Pig Island, but it’s only a matter of time. Michelle\u0027s comments about the alleged mistreatment of the animals have also been echoed on Tripadvisor.  While most reviews are excellent or good, some show the dark side and dangers of interacting with the wild animals. One reviewer claimed: The pigs are very aggressive both in the water, and on the beach. Before you leave the boat, you are told to never turn your back on the pigs (one girl on our boat did, and she got bitten. Broke the skin). They added: I couldn\u0027t get back on the boat to leave fast enough. Another anonymous commenter said: Huge and some aggressive, because they want to eat.  They continued: People were feeding the pigs all sorts of things, hugging the pigs, trying to make them do tricks, and picking up the baby pigs. UK-based livestock manager Claire Elson, who works at a farm in the south east of England, explained why the pigs may be displaying certain behaviours. She told the : If they\u0027re biting they obviously feel in an uncomfortable position. Too much picking up can stress them out, but it\u0027s hard to say with what they\u0027ve been used to. Pigs have been known to be living on beaches so it\u0027s not unusual for them to be in that environment but they tend to have their mud wallows which they use for moisturiser and it protects them from the sun. Any animal could be at risk from getting sunburnt but it depends on their surroundings - they will probably have adapted to their surrounds there.  They\u0027re really intelligent so they will go away from danger - if they\u0027re in a dangerous positions - they wouldn\u0027t go down there. But if people without the knowledge of how to handle them are picking them up that could hurt them and that could stress them out. They will go for you - they have a bark - you don\u0027t normally hear - it takes a lot to upset a pig as they are fairly chilled out creatures. If it\u0027s early in the morning and they are wanting food they\u0027ll be more eager to get to it - they pay no attention to us - that\u0027s the first priority on their mind - it might make them more anxious Addressing claims that people have been seen feeding the pigs alcohol, she said: Well it\u0027s not even good for humans so it definitely isn\u0027t something people should be feeding to pigs. It will upset their stomach and make them ill. People just need to respect that they\u0027re wild animals and their way of life - if people are going to want to get close make sure they do that safely. If (the pig) shows signs that it doesn\u0027t want to be touched, like barking or biting - leave it alone.

Shocking footage shows a pool of urine circling her feet as another shocked traveller says: That is disgusting. You are a grown woman. The incident took place on board a Wizz Air flight from Polish capital Warsaw to London Luton on Saturday when the woman was reportedly not allowed to use the loo. According to reports, the plane was fuelling up and passengers were not allowed to go to the bathroom during the procedure. So the woman was forced to relieve herself in the galley – the compartment where food is prepared.  In the video, the young woman is seen squatting against a wall while speaking with someone on the phone. By her feet are several paper towels and a large pool of urine. With her knickers and leggings pulled down to her knees, she tells the person on the phone: You have to help me before the flight takes off. I am peeing in the aircraft. I asked them (cabin crew) if I could use the toilet, but they said I could not right now. So I am peeing in the galley. Right in front of them.  Unconcerned, the brazen woman continues: The police are coming because it is my fault. All my fault. A young British couple then interrupt the phone chat with the woman saying to her: Are you being serious? That is disgusting. You are a grown woman. But the woman who has just weed all over the floor replies: Yeah, I know. I did ask. The man then adds: So you think it is okay to piss on the floor?  There have been no further updates on what happened to the woman after police arrived. Many social media users expressed their shock after the video was shared on a \u0027Passenger Shaming\u0027 Facebook page yesterday. One said: To top things off, she thought she’d have a casual phone conversation while peeing on the floor? Oh. My. Gosh! (sic) Another commented: Be a grown up and hold it until you reach the terminal! Not sure why they denied her the lav though. (sic).

Even Darren O’Dea has been helping me with my defending and Graham Gartland has helped a lot and every day I’m trying to learn.“If my chance comes I’ll back myself to do the best I can.”Curran came off the bench in the 4-0 win over Stirling last weekend and is hoping to make it appearance No 2 nice and quickly against the Pars on Sunday.He added: “Dunfermline have always been a strong team in the Championship, always competing to get promotion to the Premiership so it will be a good test after they beat Peterhead 3-0 the other night.“There was a great turnout to the Stirling game so, hopefully, we’ll get another good one this weekend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aaeebafbd-480x564.jpg ","title":"betfred cup ties remain vital as dundee united work to get going","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee United, this season’s Betfred Cup looks all but over but don’t trying telling stand-in skipper Stewart Murdoch the final two group fixtures are meaningless.The 28-year-old knows today\u0026#8217s Tannadice clash with Alloa and next week’s trip to Elgin will be vital games as the Tangerines work to make sure they are a force in the coming Championship campaign.And while the ties so far against Arbroath and Ross County have ended in disappointment in terms of results, he believes they provided proof they’re heading in the right direction.“I think the thing is it’s really early doors and the manager will tell you we are still building, that’s maybe why we haven’t had the results we wanted,” he said.“We are still basically in a pre-season phase, so, for us, Tuesday was a really good competitive game up at County and gave us an opportunity to see exactly where we are right now.“It was another 90 minutes for the lads together and to help get to know each other. When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"blether was there a non scot in celtics 1966 1967 european cup line ups","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning himself only as “Celtic Bhoy”, he opened: “Much has been, quite rightly, made of Celtic only deploying home-grown footballers when they won the European Cup in season 1966-67.“It’s a legendary fact that team manager Jock Stein’s team were all born within 20-odd miles of Celtic Park.“I would like to go one further, though.“During Celtic’s nine-in-a-row title run from 1966 to 1974, I don’t think they fielded a non-Scottish player in any of their line-ups.“There may have been the odd one, but I can’t think of even one.”Neither can I, but if anyone can offer any input, then get in touch.*Coincidentally, two queries regarding former local junior football trophies came in within a day of each other.Brian Smith, from Coupar Angus, remembers family members talking about a Jamieson Trophy, and asked for details.The Jamieson Cup was contested by Perthshire and Angus junior clubs from 1959 through to 1968.It probably ceased to be played for due to reorganisation of the leagues into a Midland body around that time.Winners of the trophy were Alyth United (4), Forfar Celtic, Brechin Matrix and Forfar East End.Perth reader Mel Fraser put forward a trophy called the Sinagoga Cup and also asked for information.The only info I could trace on this particular piece of silverware is that Denbeath Star won it in season 1934-35.Other than that, it has to again be put out to BwB readers for additional info.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba laszlo urging dundee united to speed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo wants Dundee United to speed up when their Betfred Cup campaign continues at home to Alloa today.Despite a draw and a penalty shoot-out loss against Arbroath and a narrow defeat at Ross County in the two group ties so far, Csaba has been pleased with the signs coming from his rebuilt Tangerines.The next step forward he wants to see, though, is quicker use of the ball leading to more chances being created.“If I watch the team, Matej Rakovan, Adam Barton, Christoph Rabitsch, Callum Booth and others, they are really good football players,” he said.“They keep the ball well and have some good ideas, but we have to do more in the offence.“You can’t just control the game, you also have to go and finish, bring more danger in front of the opponent’s goal, be quicker.“I told them that for the second half at Ross County, ‘OK we are comfortable with the ball but we have to bring more danger’.”Fraser Aird will be in the squad after he sat out the County trip.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b115ff16ffe4.jpg ","title":"dundee childminder praised after short notice inspection","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA local childminder has been given a positive report by national care inspectors, who said parents were “very happy” with her standards of care.Childcare worker Jane McGinlay was visited by the Care Inspectorate at short notice last month.Inspectors spoke to her and children she was caring for that day and took feedback from parents via questionnaires as part of the assessment.They gave Ms McGinlay scores of “very good” across the board – the second-highest rating.Key among the factors that influenced inspectors were Ms McGinlay’s initial conversations with parents to understand each child’s needs and the preparation of healthy lunches and snacks.A report published following the visit said: “The children were observed to be extremely confident, relaxed and ‘at home’ with the childminder.“It was clear there was a very strong relationship between the children and the childminder which had grown over the years of attending the service.”No formal requirements or informal recommendations were issued.Jane, from Whitfield, said she was “really chuffed” with the findings in the report, adding: “I do this part-time now and we’ve just moved home and downsized, so I was really pleased the inspectors said there was still enough room for the kids to play in.“It’s such a rewarding job and I love it.

I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

a proper dens park send off says dundee ace cammy kerr","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee favourite Cammy Kerr has called on the club’s supporters to give Alan Gilzean the send off the Dens legend deserves this weekend.The Dark Blues take on Dunfermline this Sunday in the first home game since Gilzean passed away at the age of 79.The club legend’s funeral takes place tomorrow and Sunday’s clash promises to be one full of emotion for everyone associated with Dundee.A special matchday programme will be available while there will be a minute’s silence and black armbands worn by the players but Kerr expects a bumper home crowd to give Gilzean a roaring send-off.The 22-year-old said: “It’s a terrible thing to happen.“Sadly, I never got to see him play or have the privilege of meeting him but what a figure to have played at this football club.“To know you are at the same football club as some of the greatest footballers have played at is fantastic.“I’d like to send my regards and best wishes to his family at this time, obviously a tough time.“In terms of the game, I think it will be emotional and, hopefully, the crowd turn out for a very special player for this football club.“I’ve read a few of things in the papers about the player he was and I actually remember watching the thing on TV at White Hart Lane when they closed the old stadium.“I knew he was a good player but I didn’t know how big he was for Tottenham.“When they said ‘The Original King of White Hart Lane, Alan Gilzean’ it just shows the regard he was held in down there.“Naming a lounge after him doesn’t do him justice because he was, obviously, a great talent.”Being a fan himself, Kerr knows the kind of supporters Dundee have and the loyalty they show their team – something he experienced in a very noisy welcome and send-off at last week’s friendly against Farense in Portugal.“We could hear them when we got off the bus in Albufeira but you can’t see how many there were,” Kerr added.“At the end I got a few photos and things and they were singing away.“The best bit was when we were leaving and they were all banging on the bus – it was great!“You see European games and all the fans waiting on the buses so it felt like that, it felt great.“For the fans to go across there just shows the loyalty that they’ll go across to Portugal for a friendly. That’s fantastic to see.“I gave away a pair of my boots and I think someone had them on running about the streets about 10 minutes later!”Allan Johnston’s Pars side will be looking to spoil Dundee’s return to the newly-named Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park by putting themselves into pole position in Betfred Cup Group D.And Kerr knows the Dark Blues will have to be right on their game to see off a Dunfermline side that swept past Peterhead in midweek.He added: “The game is on the TV as well which is good and the pitch is coming on really well, too. The groundsmen do a great job to give us a good pitch.“It’s always good to come out and have a game on the TV, it’s exciting, but Dunfermline are a side that will definitely try to push this year.“They’ve made some really important signings throughout their side and they’ll be a really tough test, so we’ll have to be firing on all cylinders.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b520462da7b4-e1532336302544.jpg ","title":"host of edinburgh fringe stars coming to dundee for month of live comedy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA host of stars from the Edinburgh Fringe are to descend on Dundee for a month of live comedy.The Icebreaker comedy club is gearing up to welcome some of the top acts from the world’s biggest arts festival throughout August.Among those set to appear include comics who have made appearances in Doctor Who and the Late Show with David Letterman.And the mini-Fringe has been backed by a city councillor who says Dundee could become Scotland’s answer to Chicago.The man behind The Icebreaker, Luis Alcada, has spent the last 18 months building the city’s comedy scene.Monthly open mic spots at The Braes on Perth Road have now been followed by successful Saturday night shows at Henry’s Coffee House in City Square.The Blackness funnyman said: “We’re going to be doing a kind of pick of the Fringe series throughout August which we’re really looking forward to.“We’re finishing a website and a few sketches for The Social on BBC Scotland so there’s quite a lot going on.“So far we’ve got Jamie Diglossia, Gareth Waugh and Matt Hoss who does vegan comedy events down south.“We’ve also got Bethany Black who was in Doctor Who and Al Lubel who was on the David Letterman show a few years ago, so it’s really exciting.“The idea is to go around and pick some shows that I like that will fit in with a Dundee crowd and either book them for one of our Saturday night shows or in one-off shows the last week in August.”Lynne Short, Dundee City Council’s convener of city development, added: “What the guys at the Icebreaker are doing is absolutely fantastic.“I’ve always been in favour of bringing some kind of permanent comedy club to Dundee.“Where better to find a classical comedy night than in a coffee shop in our civic square on a Saturday night?“I’m told the only problem with Dundee acts is keeping them within the five-minute time frame.“The only way to get a night-time economy is to go and support our night-time businesses.“I’d encourage anyone to go along and give them their backing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kharl madianga set to make first dundee start","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith midfielder Glen Kamara expected to be missing for Dundee this weekend, Kharl Madianga is expected to get his first chance from the start against Dunfermline.The Dark Blues host the Pars in Betfred Cup Group D on Sunday with Finnish international Kamara a big doubt after a training-ground clash left him with a protective boot on his foot.The club are hoping the damage is minimal and the use of the boot is purely a precaution.However, it’s unlikely he’ll be risked for the weekend game with Allan Johnston’s side.That means French midfielder Madianga is in line for a first competitive start since signing for the club over the summer.The former French U/17 international joined the club from Bulgarian side Lokomotiv GO – the same side Sofien Moussa was signed from.He made his competitive debut for the Dark Blues last weekend in the 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion, coming off the bench for fellow-new boy Elton Ngwatala.And manager Neil McCann said after that game Madianga was one Dundee fans should look forward to seeing in action.“Kharl came on and showed glimpses as well, he’s a fantastic player so in the midfield I think we have some real exciting talent in there,” the Dens gaffer said.Also missing at the moment for Dundee is winger Roarie Deacon.He’s continuing his recovery from ankle surgery and is expected to be out for a while yet.Club skipper Darren O’Dea missed the win at Stirling last week, and two friendlies in Portugal the previous week, with a groin problem.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b5204cf7b82c.jpg ","title":"local bands to perform in annual music festival next month","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDD8 Music’s annual Live in the Den festival will be held at The Den in Kirriemuir.The event takes place on Saturday August 11 from noon-6pm.This year’s live performances from local bands will include SAZ, Sonnet 65, Emerald Sunday, Houdini Said No and headliners Blackhawk Rally Band.Also playing will be DD8 Music’s very own “DD8 Music Allstars”, a group of aspiring young musicians who regularly take part in free weekly youth sessions.

The council is rolling out more Eurobins but we don’t have the resources to empty them.“People are continuing to load black bags beside the bins and the binmen are having to go along and try to keep it all clean.“It’s tidy at the Waterfront but the further you go into town the more you see rubbish lying around.”West End Liberal Democrat councillor Fraser Macpherson, who has repeatedly opposed street cleaning cuts, said the figures were “very concerning”.He said: “While we all appreciate the financial pressures facing the council, it is clear street cleaning has borne a larger and unfair share of revenue cuts and the bottom line is there are now too few staff and too much pressure on the staff that are left.“The staff left do a very good job but there must be sufficient resources to achieve a high quality service.”Mr Macpherson added he had received more complaints about street cleaning than any other issue for the first time in 17 years as a councillor.“SNP councillors have to act and resource street cleaning sufficiently so we are not just Scotland’s sunniest city but again become Scotland’s cleanest city too,” he added.Councillors approved further cuts earlier this year, with neighbourhood services convener Kevin Cordell using his casting vote to continue the restructuring programme.A council report in April cited projects such as the Pride In Your City campaign – which promotes responsible citizenship towards dog fouling and litter-picking – as examples of successful streamlining.A Dundee City Council spokesman declined to comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f0793923bf-771x564.jpg ","title":"stirling albion or celtic its all the same to dundee new boy jean mendy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn his very short time at Dundee, Senegalese striker Jean Mendy has already shown he can get fans off their seats at Dens Park this season.And he plans to continue doing that – as well as getting goals – whether he’s playing against Stirling Albion or Celtic, it’s all the same to him.He told the Tele: “I don’t know the teams at the moment!“For me, playing Stirling is like playing against Celtic, it’s the same for me – I just play my game, it doesn’t matter, and try to win every game.”The 28-year-old was delighted to start his career in dark blue with a goal after he knocked in a good strike from the edge of area as his new team began the season with a morale-boosting 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion.“It was good and we won of course – it’s very important to start winning,” Mendy added.“It was a little bit hot, I think, on the pitch on Saturday, we could feel it.“The performance was good, can be better you know, it was the first game but it was good to get the confidence with this game.“It was great for the team to score a lot of goals and we have shown we have people who can score.“I was pleased to get the goal, I got the chance and I put it in.“It was perfect for me to start with a goal and good for my confidence so I’m very happy to start like this.”Mendy joined the club from Belgian top-flight side Lokeren where he struggled to make an impact.That was after piling in the goals in the Norwegian lower leagues.Back in 2012, he banged in 27 goals in 25 league games for Elverum in the third tier before 27 in 52 in the next tier for Kristiansund. A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We

house values","story":"Residents in a remote Inverness-shire glen are challenging a power giant over a massive electricity substation that is expanding towards their homes.The 12 or so residents at Auchterawe near Fort Augustus fear their idyllic homes\u0026rsquo value has been slashed and the peaceful area blighted as the Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) substation expands to become one of the biggest around.\"From a tiny substation it is going to become an industrial site,\" said Steve Lanning who is leading the fight for compensation from SSE.\"For years SSE has been developing the small substation into what promises to become a huge facility. It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me. The other residents are my friends and we are all in the same boat.\"A spokeswoman from SSE said: \"Our proposal has been developed in close consultation with the local community and other stakeholders based on a range of economic, environmental and technical considerations.\u0026nbsp\"As a responsible developer, we have listened carefully to the feedback during consultation, and to minimise the visual impact of the extension, we are proposing a gas-insulated switchgear solution, which significantly reduces the footprint of the site.\"We have also purchased additional land to allow for enhanced screening and bunding to further mitigate the visual impact.\"We remain committed to working constructively with the local community.\"She added that there have been two public consultations, and SSE also facilitate a dedicated community\u0026nbspliaison group in the area where senior management and project teams are on hand to engage directly with residents to address any concerns raised.A detailed planning application has been lodged and a council planning decision is expected in September.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Our decision will take into account all relevant matters including the potential impact of the development on third parties.\"It is not the responsibility however of local government to provide compensation to third parties who may consider they have been impacted upon by developments as a result of a planning decision.\"Monday 23 Jul 2018 1:35

School of Highland Dance and travelled to the ScotDance Canada Championships Series in Calgary, Alberta recently, where she took on fellow dancers from all over the world.Clearly not fazed by the competition she was ultimately named Open Canadian Champion for her age group.The competition was her fifth championship event and she won all three categories she entered \u0026ndash Highland competition, Premiership National Championship and Open Highland Championship.This latest victory followed on from a runner-up spot at the SDTA Central Scotland Championshps earlier this year, an impressive placing that was itself followed by her first Open Championship title secured at the UK Alliance Championships in Edinburgh, in which she saw off 33 other top competitors.Her younger sister Grace (9) also competed in the Canadian event, in the intermediate section, and came home with five medals.Provost Helen Carmichael had met both girls before they set off across the Atlantic and was delighted to welcome them back to Inverness Town House this week.\"Lily is an excellent example of what our young people can achieve with commitment and sheer endeavour,\" she said.\"While I congratulate Lily on her personal achievements I also commend the role that she is playing through her participation in international Highland dance competitions as a young ambassador for Inverness

took place at the start of the championship series.\"The girls acted as ambassadors for Inverness, exchanging pins between dancers of many different nationalities.\"Lily\u0027 mother Yvonne said: \"A

is located across from the end and beginning of the Great Glen Way and, as such, we have a large number of visitors - walkers and cyclists.\"The beer garden that we have is small and we are limited in how many cycles we can accommodate. The only other place for them is on the footpath. This can cause restricted use of the path for pedestrians and customers.\"Our plans for the area are to tidy it up and improve the landscaping, insert some tables and benches and a secure area for housing bicycles.\"The plot, she added, would be serviced by the Castle Tavern\u0027 CCTV and be maintained to a high standard.There are also possible longer-term plans to install a charging point for electric bikes.\"The use of this land would be mainly seasonal as we do not intend to put any building on it and it would be used primarily for visitors who currently cycle or walk the Great Glen Way,\" she said.Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister said she thought it was a \"wonderful\" idea for tourists and residents alike.\"It will be perfect for when the weather is nice and people want to sit outside for their meals,\" she said.\"The Castle Tavern is always very busy, especially their outside area.\"Cllr McAllister wants to encourage more restaurants and bars to utilise outdoor areas as long as they are able to ensure that people with disabilities are not impacted.\"In Inverness our streets can be quite narrow, so it has to be done properly,\" she said.Glad to hear that the move by the Castle Tavern could benefit cyclists, she added: \"The more bikes on the roads in Inverness the better the quality of air for everyone.\"Monday 23 Jul 2018 1:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116631.jpg","title":"Inverness street closures ahead of Highland Games","story":"THE Inverness Highland Games take place on Saturday at Bught Park.The programme, however, will start on Friday with the Inverness Gala evening including the Inverness Wheelbarrow Grand Prix, organised by Inverness Culloden Rotary Club, and performances in the High Street by the City of Inverness Pipe Band, the Elizabeth Fraser School of Highland Dancing and the Inverness branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Association.There will also be a parade across Ness Bridge to the Northern Meeting Park at 7pm where the Highlands\u0027 Strongest Man and Strongest Woman Championships organised by the Forge Gym will take place.As part of these events a number of city centre streets will be closed between 6.50pm and 7.25pm on Friday evening.Closures planned are as follows:1.

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Monday 23 Jul 2018 1:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Monday 23 Jul 2018 1:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

It’s very 50/50.”He added: “From what Aberdeen showed in that game, I think they’ve got all the chances in the world. It’s very possible.“Anything is possible in football.“It’ll be a tough game, for both sides.”Burnley have far more resources at their disposal than the Dons as a result of being in the cash-flooded Premier League.Last season, the Clarets received almost £120 million in television payments for coming seventh compared with the Reds’ £2.3m for finishing second in the Scottish Premiership.The winner in the game Burke played in was scored by Chris Wood – a £15 million signing for Dyche’s team.But Burke thinks Aberdeen starting their pre-season earlier than the Turf Moor outfit, a result of the Scottish top flight returning earlier, could swing things in the Dons’ favour.He said: “Starting their training earlier can maybe give them that extra boost and they’ll maybe be fitter and have had a bit more time.“That could be a big opportunity.”Burke himself is looking to get more playing time under new boss Darren Moore in the Championship this season, having once been touted as Scotland’s answer to Welsh superstar Gareth Bale.The Kirkcaldy native has played five times for Scotland and was at the Toulon Tournament in France as the national team’s Under-21s finished fourth this summer.Burke said: “For me it’s all about getting games under my belt and that’s all I want to do.“I just want to play football and there’s nothing more I want.“Hopefully this season can be my season, as you would say, and I can enjoy myself and get myself back to where I was.“\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"winners of aberdeen v burnley clash to face turkeys istanbul basaksehir","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen will go head to head with Burnley in the Europa League for the right to face Turkish side  İstanbul Başakşehir in the third qualifying round.The winners of the Dons v Burnley second qualifying round clash will play the side that finished third in the Turkish Super League in the next round.The third qualifying round draw was made today at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon Switzerland.Aberdeen play Premier League Burnley in the second qualifying round first leg at Pittodrie on Thursday with the return at Turf Moor the following week.The winners of the Aberdeen \u0026#8211 Burnley clash were seeded and initially drawn in Group One.Teams they could have drawn were:Tobol Kostanay (KAZ) v Pyunik (ARM)\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"bid to help find owner of swan which turned up at north east country estate","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff at Haddo House and Country Park are seeking the owner of a swan in their care.The bird, who they have named Ruby, appeared at the Aberdeenshire National Trust property last week.Staff noticed how tame she was and suspected she was hand-reared.They contacted the North East Wildlife and Animal Rescue Centre for a medical check, at which point it was discovered the swan was underweight and suffering from an infection.An appeal for information has been posted on Haddo’s Facebook’s page.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.0\u0027  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))Ruby UpdateWe\u0026#039ve now reached over 11,000 people \u0026#8211 you guys are amazing!

And when asked about value for money, 84% of Aberdonians though ticket prices were too costly – compared to a national average of 58%.However, the firm previously said it was “surprised” by the results, which it said were out of line with the regular independent survey carried out by Transport Focus, which has generally shown satis-faction rates in the high 80% region.The changes come into effect on August 5.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"call for rethink as guide dog struggles in pedestrian zone","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA “pedestrian priority” zone in Aberdeen city centre has raised concerns among the blind community about the need for a safe crossing to be created.Work on the £3.2 million Broad Street project is finally due to finish on August 1 after several delays.The pedestrian priority zone will be open to buses, bicycles and pedestrians. The road and pavement will be built at the same level in a bid to provide a safer and more attractive street environment.However, Mary Rasmussen, chairwoman of Guide Dogs Aberdeen, visited the Upperkirkgate junction and Broad Street for a “walkabout” last week with members of the council and the Disability Equity Partnerships (DEP).She said: “With several cars speeding on the roundabout and Broad Street not yet fully open, it was impossible for me and my guide dog Vince to get safely across the road.“In pedestrian priority zones, the cars are meant to stop for pedestrians, and the council members did say they would educate drivers to do this.“But when two sighted members of the group tried walking slowly across the junction waving arms at drivers, they did not slow down and showed no desire to give way to pedestrians.“Marischal College is the seat of our local government and blind and partially sighted people shouldn’t be put off going there out of fear.”Mrs Rasmussen is now calling for a controlled crossing to be put in place at the Upperkirkgate, allowing for easy access to Broad Street.She will also return to the area for another walkabout, when the Broad Street development officially opens on August 1.Liberal Democrat councillor Steve Delaney said: “This walkabout once again goes to show the inherent dangers posed to people with sight, hearing and mobility impairment as they try to access Marischal College and Marischal Square.“I remain very worried indeed that the public are being put at danger.“It’s not just the use of buses in Broad Street.“I also have concerns about the lack of a pedestrian crossing on Upperkirkgate, which is open to all forms of transport.“All it needs to make this safe is a signalised crossing point, but that has been omitted in the interests of aesthetic appearance.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners joy as preferred option for north east junction chimes with her own","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA campaigner who has battled for 14 years for a flyover at a notorious north-east junction has expressed joy after a preferred option was revealed.Transport Scotland’s proposals for the £24 million A90/A937 junction at Laurencekirk have gone on display for members of the community.The preferred flyover option replacing the existing junction south of Laurencekirk has been chosen by Transport Scotland.The A937 carries over the A90 on a new bridge with a roundabout either side of the bridge.A link road would provide replacement access to Johnston Lodge and Johnston Mains from the eastern roundabout.The centre and north junctions at Laurencekirk from the A90 would remain open.Three options had been put on display last year for members of the community to have their say on.Campaigners have been calling for a flyover at the A90/A937 road for nearly 15 years.Jill Fotheringham from Laurencekirk, who spearheaded the campaign, got involved in 2004 after a number of deaths on the route.The florist, who has a shop in Montrose, was one of the first in line to see the plans for the route having been outside the Dickson Hall since 10.50am.The 53-year-old said: “After a family came into my shop to get flowers after their young boy died I didn’t want to see another death and I was angry.“So, my thoughts were to get a petition together with a few hundred signatures and hand it in and see what would happen.“I had no idea at the time how big this would become.“I’ve been at this since I was in my thirties.“However, seeing the plans today and to know that the flyover is happening is fantastic.“I’m happy to see it finally coming and mad that it has taken so long.“When I saw the preferred option I was delighted as it is the option that I wanted to happen. It is in the right location.”Exhibition documents said the preferred option has the least impact on the environment, would reduce delays and was the cheapest of the three possibilities.It was announced in January 2016 the road upgrade would be part of £504m of investments allocated to the north-east to improve infrastructure and attract jobs.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: “Having put a number of options for the planned improvements at Laurencekirk on display last year and considered the feedback following the public exhibition, we are now able to let the public see and comment on the preferred option that has been identified for this much-needed upgrade.“The plans on display will help reduce accidents and delays by preventing traffic turning or crossing at the busy A90 junction to the south of the town.“This will be achieved by grade-separating it which will also improve safety and accessibility for all active travel users.“I would encourage as many people as possible to attend the exhibitions to see the preferred option or view the material online and give us their views.“All comments we receive will be considered as we develop the preferred option in greater detail and look to publish draft orders for the scheme in 2019.”Aberdeenshire Lord Provost Bill Howatson, who represents the Mearns, said: “I think this is long overdue and we have been waiting for this for some time, but this is a positive step forward.“It still has to go through due process but with all going well and all boxes being ticked work could start in 2020 or 2021.”Councillor Jeff Hutchison, who represents the Mearns ward, said: “There is still a small consultation to go but I am happy with the junction that has come forward and the residents also seem happy. It is a horrendous junction and this is a step in the right direction and allows the town to move on and plan its future.”Fellow ward councillor Leigh Wilson said: “After speaking to members of the public they appear to be happy with the preferred option.“This is a positive move for Laurencekirk.”Mearns councillor George Carr said: “It will be welcomed by the community.

We need to dust ourselves down, because if we play like that on Wednesday we could get a hiding and we need to make sure that doesn’t happen obviously.”One positive for Peterhead was veteran striker Derek Lyle coming on for McAllister to make his debut after injury.Lyle looked lively and fellow new boy Paddy Boyle could come in for Wednesday, with Mick Dunlop set for a possible debut in the next week.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shire skipper venske returns to play his part in victory in the capital","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeenshire bounced back to form in Edinburgh where an inspired Chris Venske returned from injury to help his side home in a low-scoring game against Eastern Premier strugglers Stewarts Melville.After losing the toss, captain Venske scored a century and claimed three wickets.He showed the way after being asked to bat, hitting 113 of his side’s 189 before helping to bowl out the home side for 174.Venske’s three wickets for 33 were vital in the narrow win, while overseas amateur Callum Mackaness weighed in with three for 26.Venske played down his own part and said: ”It was great to be back, but our young team demonstrated their desire to win, and got their just deserts.“Callum bowled well as did new boy Nathan Elliott.“We can build on this win and go on to claim a top-half place in the division.”Stoneywood-Dyce kept up the pressure on Strathmore Union leaders Falkland, easing to a 25-run win at Broughty Ferry where captain Liam Lindsay made it four wins out of four since he has been standing in for the injured Jack Mitchell.The South African led from the front with a superb 66 before going on to take three 2nd Forfarshire wickets for 27.He said: ”Once again this was a team performance.“Opener Stuart Lister scored 48, Josh Newton was 47 not out and veteran George Ninan took three for 29.“We are still on track for promotion.”Mannofield made it three wins for Aberdeen sides in Perth where Justin Haddon had another field day, scoring an unbeaten 64 of his team’s 240 for four.He was supported by a solid knock of 59 from Grant Jamieson and an equally impressive innings of 51 from Fraser Proud, helping his side overhaul the Doo’cot total of 237.The only city team in the National Leagues to lose were Gordonians who fell an agonising nine runs short of the 182 set by Dundee High.Captain Aman Arora was the home stand-out, taking two wickets and hitting 34 runs.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"locke to sit and think about decision to turn pro and its back to job in cafe as italys molinari claims title","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStonehaven amateur Sam Locke insists he won’t rush into the decision on whether to turn professional after winning the Silver Medal at Carnoustie.Locke, 19, only made it into the field through final qualifying at the Renaissance Club but ended up as the 147th Open’s last Scot standing.He was also the only amateur who made it to the weekend, and a 78 on the final day saw him finish nine over.It was Francesco Molinari who became the first Italian player to win a major title after one of the most dramatic final rounds in the history of the championship – carding a nerveless closing 69 to finish eight under par, two clear of Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy, Kevin Kisner and Xander Schauffele.But Locke has also been centre of attention at the famous course with questions about when he’ll turn pro coming from all quartersHe said: “I’m going to have to sit and have a think about it.“I’ve just thoroughly enjoyed being here, learning a lot and soaking it all in. But we’ll see. We’ll need to have a think and make a proper decision.”The Paul Lawrie foundation player confirmed he’ll consult Aberdeen’s 1999 Open champion and his own family, including teaching pro dad Andrew, before making up his mind.He added: “With my family and Paul and the foundation, we’ll all sit down and have a chat because we need to make the right decision, whatever that may be.“But, yeah, to have him (Lawrie) there, he’s been and done everything.“So he’ll obviously have some great advice and put me on the right path.”Locke reiterated he might try to make next year’s Walker Cup team first.But one thing’s for sure – tomorrow he’ll be clocking in for a shift at the Paul Lawrie Golf Centre café, where he works part-time.He said he believed as soon as he qualified for the Championship the Silver Medal was something he could win.Locke joins a pantheon of famous medal winners, not least two contenders from yesterday, Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods.This is something he said gives him a lot of confidence, but he remains focused on improving his game.He added: “Hopefully, if I can just keep working hard and doing what I’m doing, there’s no reason why I can’t become a big name. But, yeah, it’s a great feeling.”His maiden major experience hasn’t quite sunk in, and who can blame him?Locke and his family sat down for a chat with five-time Open winner Tom Watson – who’d asked to speak to the young north-east player and gave him advice on the mental side of golf.He said: “One of the things Tom said was how he dealt with things when he was nervous. It’s a different approach to how I’ve heard it before.“It was nice to learn that. He said he deals with it more physically, slowing his walks down, instead of thinking of it mentally.“He kind of thought of it in a different way. So it was great to obviously meet him and pick his brains and learn from him.“He’s obviously a great of the game, and hopefully I can follow in his footsteps.”After his final round, Locke, who was planning to show his fellow Stonehaven members – marshals on the 17th hole this week – his prize in the near future, thanked the Open crowds for their support.He said: “The crowd have been brilliant with me.“I’ve had a lot of support, more than I was expecting, which was really nice.“I think that maybe came with being the only Scot left, especially the last few days.“It was brilliant walking down 18 today, although I had a poor back nine. You’ll never forget an experience like that.”Molinari, who had two wins and two second places in his previous five starts this season, was playing alongside a rejuvenated Tiger Woods.The Italian followed 13 straight pars with a birdie on the 14th and finished a brilliant round in fitting style with another from just three feet on the 18th.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery. It shows Jim\u0026#8217s mother with two girls and appears to have been sent to him after his move to America. Part of the handwriting on the back is obscured but reads: \u0026#8216Hannan\u0026#8217s daughter, mom and myself taken last summer.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Mom\u0026#8217 would refer to Jim\u0026#8217s mum, \u0026#8216myself\u0026#8217 the teenage girl whose age meant she could not be the daughter of Wilhelmina or the sister of Jim. Who was she and was she part of the story which caused Jim to cut himself off from his Scottish roots?If you have any information which could help solve this mystery please email the Argyllshire Advertiser editorial team at editor@argyllshireadvertiser\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"delighted scott reclaims toss title","story":"\t\tJoanne SimmsUpdated: 23/07/18, 12:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowScott Rider is once again World Caber Champion, after he had to toss for it at Inveraray Games on Tuesday.The former Commonwealth Games shot-putter and Olympic four-man bobsleigh team member won in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Judges at Winterton Park declared it was too close to call between the Englishman and Peter Bouma from Holland and it was down to a single toss of the caber each to decide the honour.The field of 10 was whittled down to a final five which also included Jamie Gunn, from Falkirk Lukasz Wenta, East Kilbride and Stuart Anderson, Lochearnhead.The event is sponsored by The George Hotel, Inveraray.

Council bosses have sized up the task, fearing the iconic structure has reached the end of the line. Large parts of Ayr railway station are closed to the public as safety teams comb the site. But the Post has learned that even a short-term salvage mission will cost more than \u0026pound300,000. Senior councillors have been briefed to expect a hefty hit to the wallet. South Ayrshire bosses will bid to retrieve whatever they spend from the hotel’s absentee Malaysian owner. But a senior adminsitration source said: “We have to face the reality of the situation. “The cost of refurbishing the hotel would be well in excess of \u0026pound10m, so that’s a non-starter. “I think that knocking it down is quickly becoming our only option.” That prospect is likely to face a strong challenge from groups such as Historic Scotland. And political tensions could further complicate the picture.  It comes as the hotel’s safety cordon was extended to take in part of the road over the railway. Teams are inspecting the condition of the building’s gable end amid concerns it could collapse on to people and cars below. Trains continue to run as normal, but access for commuters has now become fraught with difficulty. And worried rail chiefs are now said to be hatching contingency plans, should Ayr become become a no-go zone. But council bosses this week refused to confirm whether an official briefing on demolition had taken place. In a statement, they said: “Work to fully assess the condition of the former Station Hotel is continuing on site. “However, a decision on any future action will be dependent on the findings of the ongoing works and surveys.” But the council’s opposition group claim they are being kept in the dark over developments. Tory boss, Martin Dowey, said the public need to be kept informed. “I’m surprised this figure appears to be being quoted by members of the administration,” he added. “The SNP’s claim of inclusion and transparency is just one more empty promise. “The public need to be kept informed about the hotel and the council’s plans for its future, if that does indeed involve demolition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHistoric ScotlandScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12945474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_110718WINDOW_01JPG.jpg","title":"ayr window cleaner keith mckissock","story":"NewsAyr window cleaner Keith McKissock says South Ayrshire Council parking wardens are \"stopping\" him from workingFurious Keith McKissock claims he is being \"stopped\" from going about his business in Ayr town centre.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson10:49, 19 JUL 2018NewsKeith has won support from customers and some councillors (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA popular window cleaner claims council bosses are blocking his bid to work. Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Hair and Make-up was styled and created by Forever Diamonds, Prestwick Catherine added: “Hair and make up and all things beauty were done by my cousin Sean Diamond’s salon. His team worked very hard to give us exactly what we wanted. “We can not thank all our suppliers enough - but to the venue Gailes Hotel, the effort the staff put in down to every detail and ensuring everything ran on time and smoothly . “Also, our Venue dresser John at LG Wedding and events he made everything look so magical and sparkly, this guy is a miracle worker. “As I work in the industry and have met many brides over time, it was such a strange feeling having the day being about me and having my very own photobooth and marryoke that my boss Marc from Foxy Photobooth provided. “All my guests loved it and the marryoke video ‘She is a belter’ has hit 5k views.” For more photos of Catherine and Jamie\u0027s wedding, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Prestwick Airport were delighted that the UK Space Agency (UKSA) continued to support their plans to be one of the UK’s three horizontal space launch sites. This follows the Space Agency’s announcement that Sutherland will be the UK’s first vertical spaceport, a significant step for the UK space industry. Prestwick bosses believe they are by far the most suitable spot for horizontal space launch in the UK in terms of location, capability and the thriving satellite manufacturing industry that exists on their doorstep. An independent assessment said most of the anticipated infrastructure required for space launch capability is already in place at the site, meaning that they could move speedily to achieve a licence once the legislation is defined. Airport bosses say the development of a spaceport at Prestwick is a real opportunity for the Scottish and Ayrshire economies. The spaceport project is an integral part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal and supporters say it would attract new investment to the aerospace cluster located around the airport, safeguarding existing jobs and creating many new ones. Stewart Adams, chief executive of Glasgow Prestwick Airport, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support we have from South Ayrshire Council and look forward to our continued collaboration with them and our other partners as we look to successfully deliver on our joint vision, a vision that places Glasgow Prestwick Spaceport as a centre of excellence for the space and aerospace industries. “We will be having further discussions with all our stakeholders to review our strategy and how to take our plans forward in light of the additional funding available. “We will also be talking to potential customers and launch partners willing to support operations at Prestwick.” South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Prestwick is still the most advanced site currently in the running for the UK’s first horizontal space launch and we’ll seek to use the development fund to cement our position. “Our focus will continue to be on supporting our partners to ensure Prestwick can deliver the significant levels of jobs and investment that we know can be realised.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, said: “The case for Prestwick hosting this facility is a strong one, including the availability of a 2,987m runway and many aerospace businesses already on site with and land to accommodate more.” And MP Bill Grant added: “I am delighted that Sutherland in North East Scotland has been selected for the UKs first vertical take-off Spaceport facility and equally important is the fact that Glasgow Prestwick is still in the running for a Spaceport licence for horizontal take off facilities.” The commercial space sector is worth an estimated \u0026pound3.8billion to the UK economy over the next 10 years.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12953553.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Craig-Ferguson-Promotes-American-On-Purpose.jpg","title":"talk show host holds giant","story":"NewsTalk show host holds giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansionAnd the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:23, 20 JUL 2018NewsStill Game stars Isa, Jane McCarry, and Tam, Mark Cox (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFamed American talk show host Craig Ferguson has staged a giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansion. And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"true-blue-mollie-honoured-on-her-99th-birthday","story":"PEEBLESSHIRE\u0027S longest-serving political campaigner has celebrated her 99th birthday this week.\nAnd Mollie McIntosh, who is also an active of her Walkerburn community, was sent a card and flowers by the Secretary of State for Scotland.\nMollie, who was awarded an MBE for services to her community in 2009 and was named Tweeddale Citizen of the Year the year before, has never allowed age to stop he working for both Tweeddale and her beloved Conservative party.\nBorn and bred in Walkerburn, she became an active member of the Conservatives when she was just 18 years old.\nPaying tribute on her birthday this week was MP David Mundell.\nThe Secretary of State for Scotland said: \"I enjoy saying to Mollie that she is one of our most active \u0027Young Conservatives\u0027 and she still volunteers her services to her local branch at every opportunity.\n\"She\u0027s a remarkable lady who has never missed an election in her adult life, both as a party volunteer and a voter.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

Mrs Cavers is principal guidance teacher with Moray house and Mr Gellaitry is principal guidance teacher at Grange house.  The pair were honoured at a celebratory lunch in the school which was attended by colleagues.  In his speech, headteacher Colin Gerrie thanked both for their \u0026ldquolong and committed service to the school and wished them every happiness in their retirement.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

A tribute on the Edinburgh RC website stated: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh RC would like to mark the life of former club member Ben Forsyth which sadly ended on July 1.  \u0026ldquoHe was a stalwart member of the youth section until he joined the Spokes race team in 2014.  \u0026ldquoThe pinnacle of his cycling achievements was winning the British youth circuit race championship in 2013 on the promenade at Blackpool in an ERC jersey.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.

Her attempt to remain in the EU regulatory environment by adopting a \u0026ldquocommon rule book \u0026ndash in other words, agreeing to replicate all the terms of our current membership while not actually being a member of the EU \u0026ndash pleased no one. It was condemned as \u0026ldquovassalage by Boris Johnson in his resignation speech, and a \u0026ldquonational humiliation even by pro-Europeans like the former Labour EU Commissioner, Lord Mandelson. The trade bills scraped through parliament last week on the back of a handful of rebel Labour MPs and the indolence of the current and former Liberal Democrat leaders who failed to show for a crucial vote on Monday.

The Scottish Government hasn\u0027t commented on the no deal preparations, but it, too, will have to think the unthinkable.

Now, when people talk of a no-deal Brexit they usually mean something like Britain \u0026ldquoreverting to World Trade Organisation terms, or a Canada-style free trade agreement. Wrong. No deal means no deal \u0026ndash it means no trade agreement, no two-year transition period in which things remain largely as they do today. No rights to travel in Europe for work or leisure without a visa, no common standards for medicines, nuclear material or air safety. Everyone will do their best to prevent relations with Europe breaking down completely, and people being hurt \u0026ndash but accidents can happen.  A no deal would be Britain\u0026rsquos biggest economic dislocation since the Second World War.

Brexiteers seem to believe that everything will just continue as it does now, and that all those multilateral agreements Britain has entered into over the last 40 years will somehow still apply even as we leave the EU.  Right wing economists like Professor Patrick Minford insist that Britain will be so efficient, freed from Brussels red tape, and so low cost, that we we\u0026rsquoll still be able to flood their markets with our cheap goods and services.

He said: \"We will be in a state of emergency \u0026ndash basic services we take for granted might not be available.\"  It comes as Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab appeared to confirm reports the Government is planning to stockpile food in anticipation of talks breaking down.  He accused the EU of \"irresponsibly\" ramping up pressure in withdrawal negotiations, and confirmed preparations are underway for a no deal outcome.  Official analysis previously warned Scotland\u0026rsquos economy would suffer a \u0026pound12.7 billion a year blow if no deal was struck.  Experts have also raised fears over spiralling food costs, huge queues at the Port of Dover, tens of thousands of job losses and disruption in the supply of medicines.  Kirsty Hughes, director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations, branded the increasingly fraught rhetoric around the possibility of no deal \u0026ldquocompletely insane.  But she said she was still optimistic an agreement will be struck, adding: \u0026ldquoI think no deal is getting more likely, but equally, I don\u0026rsquot think either side want it.  Speaking to the BBC, Mr Raab indicated he was still trying to persuade all members of the Cabinet that Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers compromise agreement was \u0026ldquothe best plan to get the best deal.  He insisted a deal with the EU can be reached by October, but signalled Britain could withhold its \u0026pound39 billion divorce bill if it did not get a trade deal in return.  Chancellor Philip Hammond previously said it would be \u0026ldquoinconceivable to walk away from such an obligation.  Mr Raab also rejected comments from Brussels suggesting a no deal scenario would mean there would be no specific arrangements in place for UK citizens living on the continent, or for EU migrants in Britain after withdrawal.  He told the Andrew Marr Show said: \"Well, I think that\u0027s a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side.  \"We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure.\"  Asked about reports the Government is preparing to stockpile food, Mr Raab at first denied it, but then added: \u0026ldquoThat kind of selective snippet that makes it into the media I think is \u0026ndash to the extent that the public pay attention to it \u0026ndash I think is unhelpful.\"  He insisted it would be \u0026ldquofrankly irrational for the EU to pursue the \u0026ldquoworst case scenario of a no deal outcome.  Former Tory education secretary Nicky Morgan, a leading Remainer, said she believed a majority in Westminster and on the Conservative benches would not accept leaving the EU without an agreement in place.  Meanwhile, former Brexit secretary David Davis urged the Prime Minister to \"reset\" her negotiating strategy and start again.  UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Tory Government appeared to be prioritising \u0026ldquostepping up preparations for a no deal instead of concentrating on negotiations.  He said: \"I just get the feeling that the tail is wagging the dog in the Conservative Party and those that want no deal seem to be ruling the roost and they are pushing for that.\"  The SNP warned a no deal Brexit would betray the interests of ordinary people.  It comes as a parliamentary report said EU citizens granted \"settled status\" to stay in the UK after Brexit should be given physical residency cards to prove their rights, not forced to rely on online checks.  The Commons\u0026rsquo Exiting the EU Committee said Home Office plans to offer EU nationals a digital code to prove their status risked causing confusion, and could even result in people losing access to housing and jobs."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-the-answer-on-brexit-look-to-the-ideals-of-margaret-thatcher","story":"  Of course, one of the reasons Mr Rees-Mogg and his type are relaxed about a no-deal Brexit is that wealthy MPs are not the ones likely to suffer the economic consequences. But it\u0026rsquos also because a no-deal scenario would guarantee leaving the single market. Membership of the single market means accepting what the Brexiters can\u0026rsquot stomach \u0026ndash the free movement of people \u0026ndash whereas a no-deal removes the risk altogether of Theresa May compromising on the issue. Therefore, they are prepared to jump, and take us with them.  On the whole, the MPs who are the most keen to jump off the cliff and experience the sadomasochistic joys of an extreme Brexit are from the most right-wing, free-market end of the Conservative Party \u0026ndash MPs like Mr Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson, and Michael Gove (although for the moment Mr Gove is still backing the Prime Minister). In another age, these are the kind of men who would\u0026rsquove been called Thatcherites (and been proud of the label) for their love of capitalistic freedom and hatred of regulation \u0026ndash indeed, on the whole, you will find that the most Brexity Brexiters are the most Thatcherite Thatcherites.  But what would Prime Minister Thatcher have made of their antics? Perhaps she would have approved \u0026ndash after all, Mrs Thatcher is the PM who warned of the European superstate, the woman who said \u0026ldquono, no, no to Brussels, and the leader who, once out of office, became a figurehead for anti-European sentiment, perhaps even the Britannia who spawned the Brexit phenomenon in the first place. Mrs Thatcher still gets the blame for most things (and in Scotland for almost everything) so Brexit is just another thing to add to the list.  There\u0026rsquos also no doubt that the longer Mrs Thatcher was out of office the more Eurosceptic she became and, in her later years, she favoured renegotiating the UK\u0026rsquos membership of the EU to exempt us from increasing federalisation and, to her, that meant threatening to leave if necessary. In her last book, Statecraft, published in 2002, she wrote that \u0026ldquoit should be made clear right at the start that in order to secure our objectives, we would be prepared, if it became necessary, unilaterally to withdraw from EU membership.  However, I wonder if that accepted view of Mrs Thatcher\u0026rsquos stance on Europe gets it quite right and whether we shouldn\u0026rsquot instead take a much closer look at her legacy and beliefs because I\u0026rsquom not sure she would approve of where we are, or what we\u0026rsquore doing. More than that: I think her ideals can explain how we got here and a possible way forward.  For a start, Mrs Thatcher wouldn\u0026rsquot have got us into this mess in the first place. She was certainly keen to fight the EU for a different type of union \u0026ndash and proved she was good at it when she negotiated a rebate on the British contribution to the EU budget in 1984. But, unlike David Cameron, she would never have countenanced a vote on leaving the EU because she agreed with Clement Attlee that referendums are a device of dictators and demagogues.  The cache of papers concerning Mrs Thatcher\u0026rsquos famous Bruges Speech, released in the last few days, have also underlined an important point about her attitude to the EU. That speech in 1988 is often seen as a diatribe against Europe and, in some ways, the starting point of Brexit, but in fact it\u0026rsquos quite the opposite. It was a speech that calmly \u0026ndash and accurately I think \u0026ndash diagnosed the problem many British people have with the EU (even Remainers), but more importantly it came to a different conclusion to the Brexiters.  On the problem that many British people have with the EU, Mrs Thatcher was really clear-sighted. She said one of her guiding principles was that willing co-operation between sovereign states was the best way to build a successful organisation and that to try to suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the centre of Europe was damaging. Working more closely together, she said, did not require decisions to be taken by an appointed bureaucracy.  Many British people instinctively agree with this, even many of those who voted Remain. On page eight of The Herald today, you can read my interview with the historian Sir Antony Beevor and he neatly summed up the situation. The EU was established as a bulwark against nationalism, he said, but there is also a paradox at work, which is that the more Europe centralises its power, the more it creates the very nationalism that it\u0026rsquos trying to get rid of. It\u0026rsquos why Sir Antony describes himself as a Eurosceptic who voted Remain.  It\u0026rsquos this concern about centralisation that Mrs Thatcher captured so well in her Bruges speech, whereas on the economics of Europe, she came to a conclusion that the Brexiters will not like one little bit. The aim of the creation of the European single market, she said, was to make the continent open to enterprise and that meant no barriers to trade. \u0026ldquoWe want to make it easier for goods to pass through frontiers, she said, adding: \u0026ldquoOf course, we must make it easier for people to travel throughout the Community. In other words: free movement of goods, free movement of people, the single market.  In retrospect, why would anyone expect anything different from a champion of the free market like Mrs Thatcher? \u0026ldquoBritain does not dream of some cosy, isolated existence on the fringes \u0026ndash our destiny is in Europe, as part of the Community she said, and she said it because staying in the single market makes trade easier and the British economy stronger. Obviously, 30 years on from the speech, Remainers can see that \u0026ndash they know it. But surely even some Leavers \u0026ndash and especially those who admire Margaret Thatcher \u0026ndash can see it too."},{"url":null,"title":"snps-independence-blueprint-would-have-seen-spending-slashed-by-60bn-report-claims","story":"  These Islands, a pro-UK think tank, insisted the party\u0026rsquos Growth Commission actually strengthened the economic case for Scotland remaining in the union.  Its findings have drawn support from a range of leading economists including Glasgow University professors Ronald MacDonald and Jim Gallagher, Strathclyde\u0026rsquos Professor Brian Ashcroft and Brian Quinn, the former acting deputy governor of the Bank of England.  Opposition politicians insisted the report was \u0026ldquodamning, but the SNP said unionists were \"clearly rattled\" by the boost the blueprint had given to the independence cause.  The SNP\u0026rsquos Growth Commission report, which was led by former MSP Andrew Wilson and published earlier this year, claimed living standards in Scotland could \"equal the best small countries in the world\" within a generation of independence.  Its key recommendations included cutting the country\u0027s deficit and keeping the pound for at least a decade.  But These Islands insisted the Commission had \u0026ldquosingularly failed to make a coherent economic case for independence in fact their work helps highlight the economic benefits of Scotland remaining part of the UK.  It accused the report of tacitly accepting the current austerity policies of the UK Government which it claims to reject.  And it argued that if the Commission\u0026rsquos model for deficit reduction had been applied over the last decade, Scotland would have spent around \u0026pound60 billion less. In 2016/17, public spending would have been \u0026pound8bn lower.  It said the Commission itself had accepted that keeping the pound \"for a possibly extended transition period\" would be damaging to Scotland\u0026rsquos financial services sector, while its report avoided discussing how or when an independent Scotland might qualify for EU membership.  Kevin Hague, chairman of These Islands and the author of the new paper, said it showed \u0026ldquothe SNP\u0027s Growth Commission report is objectively more optimistic than the 2014 White Paper, not more realistic as has been widely claimed.  He added: \"In fact the Growth Commission\u0027s report contains highly misleading analysis, fails to address the key economic questions and \u0026ndash we presume unintentionally \u0026ndash actually strengthens the economic case for Scotland remaining in the UK.\"  His report claims the Commission\u0026rsquos recommendations would be likely to lead to austerity far greater than anything Scotland has recently experienced, or is forecast to experience within the UK.  Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said the analysis showed the SNP \u0026ldquois now making even wilder claims about secession than Alex Salmond did prior to the referendum.  He added: \u0026ldquoQuite simply, they are making it up as they go along.  \u0026ldquoAs everyone apart from the SNP acknowledges, independence would mean cuts on a scale never seen in Scotland \u0026ndash damaging every hospital, school and public service in the country.\"  Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said it was now \u0026ldquoabundantly clear that the SNP\u0026rsquos plans for an independent Scotland would result in austerity cuts that not even [former Tory Chancellor] George Osborne would have dared to implement.  She added: \u0026ldquoIf these proposals were put into practice Scotland\u0026rsquos already under pressure public services would be devastated, with spending slashed on the NHS, schools, and on other vital areas.  But an SNP spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoIf the Growth Commission\u0026rsquos approach had been followed over the last decade, the \u0026pound2.6bn of cuts to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos budget by Westminster would have been completely reversed, with the prospect of additional public spending beyond that.  \u0026ldquoThe commission has kick-started a serious and welcome debate over Scotland\u0027s future, and unionists are clearly rattled by the boost it has given to the independence case, with last month\u0026rsquos Scottish Social Attitudes survey showing that the numbers who view independence as positive for Scotland\u0026rsquos economy now outnumber those who believe otherwise.\""},{"url":null,"title":"demo-tape-features-future-rock-star-david-bowies-first-ever-recording","story":"  Young David Jones had taken up playing the saxophone in a bid to emulate his musical hero, jazz legend John Coltrane. And as he left Bromley Technical High School, the young man who would eventually became a global musical legend had already informed his parents that he planned to become a pop star \u0026ndash prompting his mother to find him a job as an electrician\u0026rsquos mate.  Jones \u0026ndash later, of course, far better known as David Bowie \u0026ndash had already had a taste of performing Shadows numbers with his band, The Konrads, at the school PTA fete, and even cut a demo disc which was promptly ignored by record company chiefs.  What happened later is, of course, musical history. David Bowie\u0026rsquos brief spell as tenor saxophonist and backing vocalist with little-known group The Konrads would be rapidly overtaken by his launch into mega-stardom, while the band\u0026rsquos single recording with the young \u0026ldquothin white duke was destined to be long forgotten.  That is, until now. For David\u0026rsquos Bowie\u0026rsquos first known studio recording has now emerged, 55 years later.  The 1963 recording, which was rejected by Decca Records \u0026ndash infamously, the same record company which turned down The Beatles in favour of The Tremeloes \u0026ndash has suddenly re-emerged after being found discarded in a bread basket.  The demo tape features a youthful 16-year-old Bowie performing I Never Dreamed, which he co-wrote with other members of the band.  The tape, which is expected to fetch \u0026pound10,000 at auction, is part of a trove of memorabilia to be sold by The Konrads\u0026rsquo former drummer David Hadfield, who also managed the band.  He found it tucked in a bread basket that once belonged to his grandfather, stashed in the loft of his garage.  Bowie was originally the band\u0026rsquos saxophonist, however, it was decided that he should sing lead vocals for the tape.  Hadfield said: \u0026ldquoDavid had no inclination to become a singer at this point, his heart and mind were focused on becoming a world-class saxophone player.  \u0026ldquoOur agent, Eric Easton, who also managed the Rolling Stones, asked us to do a demo so he could try and get us an audition at Decca.  \u0026ldquoSo, in early 1963 I booked into RG Jones\u0026rsquo small studio in Morden. In preparation for the demo, David and our guitarist Neville Wills wrote two to three songs. We had decided that we would do a couple of guitar instrumentals and one original song.  \u0026ldquoI chose I Never Dreamed as it was the strongest, the other two were a bit weak.  \u0026ldquoI also decided that David was the best person to sing it and give the right interpretation. So this became the very first recording of David Jones (Bowie) singing 55 years ago.  \u0026ldquoThere is no other recording of the demo featuring David as lead in existence, he adds. \u0026ldquoDecca initially turned us down, but when they gave us an audition later that year, vocalist Roger Ferris was the lead voice and David sang backing harmonies.  Despite the young Bowie\u0026rsquos unique voice and charismatic presence, the group was rejected by Decca and the tape of Bowie singing I Never Dreamed was never released.  Bowie quit the band in the following months, apparently dissatisfied with their choice of pop-style material. While they continued and eventually peaked as a support act for the Rolling Stones, Bowie went on to perform with a succession of other bands until finally finding success six years later with Space Oddity.  Modern digital technology means today\u0026rsquos fledgling stars\u0026rsquo early recordings are unlikely to end up stashed in someone\u0026rsquos loft.  However, recording in the past meant consigning music to master tapes, some of which had a habit of being wiped for new material, or the metal tabs cut up and sold for waste. Even tapes which by today\u0026rsquos standards would be considered \u0026ldquogold dust were destroyed by record companies looking for more storage space or simply lost in fires or thrown out.

The report, to be presented to the UN\u0027s Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women on Monday, makes 27 recommendations for improvements.  It highlights the \"disproportionate\" impact of UK welfare reforms, particularly on disabled, black and minority ethnic women and lone mothers.  SHRC wants Scottish ministers to ensure the problems experienced by women are addressed or mitigated in the development of the new social security system for Scotland.  The report points out that only 26% of public bodies are headed by women, with the gender pay gap reaching nearly 15% when the overall hourly wages of men and women are compared, putting Scotland second from the bottom of the 45 EU member states.  Access to mental health services is also highlighted as a concern, with young women more than twice as likely to be depressed as men.  With those on low incomes, disabled or from black and minority ethnic communities particularly affected, SHRC calls for equal access to services for all women.  The report praises progress made in tackling violence against women, including the recent Domestic Abuse Act, but said further concerted action is needed, particularly in relation to misogynistic bullying and sexual harassment.  It also highlights uncertainty about the implications of Brexit for the protection of human rights and women\u0027s rights, and backs a ban on smacking children.  Commission chair Judith Robertson said: \"Recent campaigns like #metoo have exposed the reality of just how many women experience day-to-day violations of their rights to safety, security and justice.  \"At the same time, women continue to be under-represented in public life, and to bear the brunt of austerity policies, with women from black and minority ethnic communities, disabled women and women on low incomes often experiencing a double or triple-whammy of disadvantage.  \"While the Scottish Government is to be commended for many of its actions to progress gender equality, our latest report to the UN shows that it must now go further, faster, to ensure that all women in Scotland are able to enjoy all of their rights - economic, social, civil and political - on the same terms as their male counterparts.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We welcome that the Scottish Human Rights Commission recognises the significant progress in women\u0027s equality made in Scotland in recent years, including passing the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act, expanding our commitment to free early learning and childcare and establishing an Advisory Council on Women and Girls.  \"We are determined to go further, which is why we are continuing to pursue measures to improve women\u0027s opportunities in the labour market, ensure women are properly represented in decision-making positions, and tackle all forms of violence against women and girls. And we continue to lead by example, with the Scottish Government having one of very few gender-balanced cabinets anywhere in the world.  \"It is deeply worrying that the UK Government\u0027s welfare cuts are having a disproportionate effect on women and hard-pressed families. This year we will invest more than \u0026pound125 million on welfare mitigation and measures to help protect those on low incomes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-200-pipe-bands-to-compete-in-world-championships","story":"  The World Pipe Band Championships are to be held on August 17-18.

For the first time, onshore wind farms on remote islands such as Shetland and Orkney will also be able to compete in the auctions, ministers announced.  The move could deliver up to an additional two gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind per year in the 2020s, to bring total capacity up to 30GW by 2030 from current levels of 7GW in operation, and 7GW in construction or with contracts.

Ben Wallace, the Security Minister, is to face an Urgent Question put down in the Commons by Labour\u0026rsquos Shadow Home Secretary, Diane Abbott.  Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, are said to have been members of the brutal four-man cell of Islamic State executioners in Syria and Iraq, responsible for killing a series of high-profile Western captives.  Along with Mohammed Emwazi - the killer nicknamed Jihadi John - and Aine Davis, Kotey and Elsheikh are thought to have been part of a group nicknamed The Beatles because of their British accents.  Kotey and Elsheikh, who are understood to have been stripped of their UK citizenship, were captured in January, sparking a row over whether or not they should be returned to Britain for trial or face justice in another jurisdiction.  In the leaked letter, obtained by the Daily , Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, told Jeff Sessions, the US Attorney General, that the UK did \"not currently intend to request, nor actively encourage\", their transfer to Britain.  Promising support for the US, Mr Javid said Scotland Yard\u0027s counter-terrorism command had been \"engaged extensively\" on the case with the FBI, with the investigation running for more than four years \"during which time they have engaged with 14 other countries and compiled over 600 witness statements\".  Signalling that the UK was prepared to drop assurances relating to the death penalty, Mr Javid said: \"All assistance and material will be provided on the condition that it may only be used for the purpose sought in that request, namely a federal criminal investigation or prosecution.  \"Furthermore, I am of the view that there are strong reasons for not requiring a death penalty assurance in this specific case, so no such assurances will be sought.\"  But Mr Javid went on to add: \"As you are aware, it is the long-held position of the UK to seek death penalty assurances, and our decision in this case does not reflect a change in our policy on assistance in US death penalty cases generally, nor the UK Government\u0027s stance on the global abolition of the death penalty.\"  The Home Secretary also said US courts were better placed to handle \"foreign fighter\" cases because of the risk of legal challenge in the UK.  No 10 made clear it was the Government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquolong-standing policy to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances and it was a matter or principle.  Asked if the Prime Minister had been aware of Mr Javid\u0026rsquos letter to Mr Sessions, her deputy spokeswoman replied: \u0026ldquoThe decision was taken by the Home Secretary and the former Foreign Secretary following the advice of lawyers and officials and the PM was made aware.  She declined to say when Mrs May was made aware but pointed out how there was a date on the leaked letter.  Asked if the PM had approved it, the spokeswoman repeated that Mrs May had been \u0026ldquomade aware, stressing: \u0026ldquoIt is everyone\u0026rsquos aim to ensure these men face justice through a criminal prosecution\u0026hellipWe are continuing to engage with the US Government on this issue\u0026hellipWe want to make sure they face justice in the most appropriate jurisdiction, which maximises the chance of a successful prosecution and we continue to talk to the US Government about it.  She stressed everyone in Government agreed with this position.  Asked if she could explain how the Government\u0026rsquos official position on opposing the death penalty tallied with the contents of the Secretary of State\u0026rsquos letter, the spokeswoman said she was in a difficult position because the letter was leaked and usual Government policy is not to comment on leaks.  But the spokeswoman claimed there was \u0026ldquono contradiction because the UK Government opposed the death penalty and she stressed judicial decisions had not yet been taken.  For Labour Shami Chakrabarti, said Mr Javid appeared to \u0026ldquohave secretly and unilaterally abandoned Britain\u0026rsquos opposition to the death penalty.  She went on: \u0026ldquoBy doing so he is not just playing with the lives of these particular terrorists but those of other Britons - including potentially innocent ones - all over the world.  The Shadow Attorney General added: \u0026ldquoJust as we should be persuading countries like the US and Iran to drop the death penalty, Sajid Javid appears to be encouraging this grave human rights abuse.  Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats stressed that the crimes committed by Kotey and Elsheikh were heinous but that the use of the death penalty was wrong no matter what the crimes involved were.  \u0026ldquoBy refusing to stand up to Donald Trump\u0027s administration on this issue, Sajid Javid has abdicated his responsibility to uphold fundamental human rights. He has undermined the UK\u0027s efforts to end the use of the death penalty around the world.  \u0026ldquoWe will only ever see an end to terrorism by sticking to our morals and principles. If the Conservative Government once again dances to the tune of a dangerous US President, it will do nothing but fan the flames of terror, added the London MP.  Human rights campaigners Amnesty International UK also condemned Mr Javid\u0027s decision not to demand an assurance from the US that the death penalty would not be imposed on the two alleged members of the \"Beatles\" group of jihadis.  Allan Hogarth, its spokesman, said: \"This is a deeply worrying development. The Home Secretary must unequivocally insist that Britain\u0027s long-standing position on the death penalty has not changed and seek cast iron assurances from the US that it will not be used.  \"While the alleged crimes of Alexanda Kotey and Shafee Elsheikh are appalling, the UK\u0027s principled opposition to the cruelty of the death penalty isn\u0027t something it should compromise.  He added: \"A failure to seek assurances on this case seriously jeopardises the UK\u0027s position as a strong advocate for the abolition of the death penalty and its work encouraging others to abolish the cruel, inhuman and degrading practice.\"  Emwazi, who was killed in a US air strike in 2015, appeared in a number of videos in which captives, including British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, were killed.  Davis was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organisation and jailed for seven-and-a-half years at a court in Silivri, Turkey, in May 2017.  Mr Foley\u0027s mother, Diane, said she was opposed to the death penalty. \u0026ldquoI am very against that. That would just make them martyrs in their twisted ideology,\" she told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.  \"I would like them held accountable by being sent to prison for the rest of their lives.\"  Lord Carlile, the former reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Mr Javid\u0027s letter was \"extraordinary\".  \"It is a dramatic change of policy by a minister, secretly, without any discussion in Parliament. It flies in the face of what has been said repeatedly and recently by the Home Office - including when Theresa May was home secretary - and very recently by the highly-respected Security Minister Ben Wallace,\" he told Today.  \"Britain has always said that it will pass information and intelligence, in appropriate cases, provided there is no death penalty. That is a decades-old policy and it is not for the Home Secretary to change that policy,\" he added.  The Home Office refused to comment on the leaked document.  But a spokesman said: \"We continue to engage with the US Government on this issue, as we do on a range of national security issues and in the context of our joint determination to tackle international terrorism and combat violent extremism.  \"The UK Government\u0027s position on Guantanamo Bay is that the detention facility should close,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"expansion for young entrepreneur joss","story":"        A young entrepreneur has announced an expansion of his holistic crystals business with a move to a new location twice the size of the previous premises.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Monday 23 Jul 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Monday 23 Jul 2018 1:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me. You don\u0026rsquot know the last time they talk to someone. That\u0026rsquos the nitty gritty of it.\"Smile and say hello, and help them if they need it. I gave an old lady a hand with her shopping trolley earlier, and when she came back out she bought a magazine off me.\"I love selling the magazine, it\u0026rsquos my job. I don\u0026rsquot get benefits, this is my only source of income, and I travel up on the bus here from Inverness every day to do it. I\u0026rsquom always on my pitch. I love it, I\u0026rsquoll moan and groan when it\u0026rsquos snowing but apart from that it\u0026rsquos great.\"My customers are amazing, I\u0026rsquom well looked after and I have good banter with them. I feel like a part of the community here. People bring me stuff all the time \u0026ndash recently I was given a bag of clothes \u0026ndash not all of them fitted me, so I took the rest to a charity shop so they could use them. And recently one of my customers bought me lunch.\"The staff at Tesco always ask how I\u0026rsquom doing \u0026ndash I get on really well with Steve, the manager, he tells me I\u0026rsquom good with the punters. I want to thank the people of Dingwall for all they\u0026rsquove done for me.\"The enthusiastic Celtic fan describes The Big Issue as \"a solid force in my life\".Monday 23 Jul 2018 1:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Monday 23 Jul 2018 1:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible. This includes not only our objects in storage, but also the wealth of archive and library material we hold, which document the history of Gairloch parish. This funding will maximise our storage space, protect our collection for the future and enrich our visitors\u0026rsquo experiences.\"Museums Galleries Scotland is the National Development Body for museums and galleries in Scotland and offers strategic development support to the sector. This round of funding saw over \u0026pound550,000 awarded to 15 different projects in 14 museums across Scotland.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaMonday 23 Jul 2018 1:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771842.1532286669!/image/image.jpg","title":"andrew blick history shows how may could form grand coalition","story":"        Conservative MP Anna Soubry recently floated a idea that to some might seem radical: establish some kind of all-party \u0026#8220national unity government\u0026#8221 to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But what are the prospects for such a project, what form might it take, and what would be the political implications?                To help answer these questions, it is useful to consider some historical precedents. On occasions over the last century or so, at moments of national crisis, politicians of the main parties at Westminster have come together to form governments intended specifically to address the threat.            There are three particular examples that stand out. In World War I, a coalition formed first under Herbert Henry Asquith in 1915 and then David Lloyd George in 1916. Then, in 1931, faced with a sterling crisis, the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald collapsed and was replaced by a national government under his leadership. And in 1940, Winston Churchill came to power during World War II as head of a newly formed coalition.            Based on these examples and other aspects of the constitution, a number of observations about the current prospects are possible. First, the most important principle for the formation and maintenance of any government is that it possesses the confidence of the House of Commons (though that need not entail winning every single vote). The House of Commons can, if determined enough, bring about the establishment of a coalition government. And so long as such a government possesses that confidence, it can continue to function.Alternatively – and perhaps more likely – rather than the House of Commons taking a direct initiative, a deal between senior politicians could command that confidence. A national unity government against a no-deal Brexit, then, is plausible in as far as a majority of MPs appear to be opposed to exit without a deal coming about. Indeed, such an administration, if it were backed by all of the “anti-no-deal” MPs, could well enjoy an absolute majority in the House of Commons, unlike the current Conservative government, which is in a Commons minority and reliant on support from the Democratic Unionist Party.READ MORE: Joyce McMillan: New political alliance vital to stop Brexit disasterThe formation of a national unity coalition may also involve an existing prime minister ending one government and forming a new one (as, for instance, MacDonald did in 1931). Alternatively, it may entail a change of prime minister (as when Churchill first came to the premiership in 1940). In other words, this coalition, if it came about, could be led by Theresa May or by someone else. That person might come from the party providing the most MPs (like Churchill in 1940) but need not do so (Lloyd George from 1916 MacDonald from 1931). They could be a party leader (Asquith in 1916) but might not (Churchill in 1940). Much would depend on the circumstances of the time and the personalities involved: who was willing to serve under whom, whether a suitable leader other than the premier was judged to have emerged whether the existing prime minister was regarded as tainted and if so was willing to step down quietly, and so on.Then there is the more problematic aspect: party. The reason a national unity government is being discussed at all is that, though a majority of MPs appear to be opposed to a no-deal Brexit, they are spread across different parties. However strongly they feel about avoiding what they see as a disastrous outcome, they are influenced by other factors as well. The prospects for the formation of any coalition inevitably turn on relations within and between different parties.            Under the adversarial political system of the UK, and given a parliamentary voting system that can often lead to single-party governments, there is a greater resistance to this kind of collaboration than in many other European systems. In the period since 1945, there has been only one full coalition, that of 2010-2015, and it did not include the Labour party so doesn’t qualify as a national unity government.When they have come into being, national unity coalitions have sometimes been associated with serious party political splits, such as that which occurred in 1916 when Lloyd George supplanted his Liberal colleague Asquith as prime minister, or in 1931 when MacDonald opted to form a National government, breaking with Labour.READ MORE: Leader comment: ‘Sensible Party’ must take control of BrexitThe coalescence of the “anti-no-deal” MPs behind a national unity government, either at the request of May or as part of her replacement with a different prime minister, would seem to involve some kind of fissure in at least one of the Conservative and Labour parties. While much would depend on the precise circumstances that triggered such an event, is seems likely that a sizeable proportion of Conservative MPs would oppose the initiative. It’s also unlikely that the present Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would be the figure around whom pro-European Conservative (or indeed Labour) MPs could rally.            A government intended to achieve unity for the UK would therefore involve disunity for both the main parties (though smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats might potentially be able to join with less difficulty, though their recent experience of coalitions might be discouraging). The historical portents are again worth considering here. The Liberal Party was severely divided by the coalitions of World War I, after which it ceased to be one of the two main political parties. Labour was seriously damaged by the split of 1931 created by the formation of the MacDonald National government. Indeed, it took participation in the Churchill coalition from 1940 for it to return to office.The lesson for today would seem to be that national unity governments are difficult to create. And when they do come together, the party political consequences can be divisive, extensive, and lasting. However, if an issue becomes pressing enough, even these considerations can be put to one side.• Dr Andrew Blick is a lecturer in politics and contemporary history at King’s College London.

Take former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, for example. Having backed the Leave campaign in 2016 because he calculated that would maximise the chances of him one day becoming prime minister, Johnson now sits on the back benches, from where he may pontificate about how to solve a crisis for which he is in great part responsible. Last week, days after his resignation from Theresa May’s cabinet, Johnson could be heard to complain that “a needless fog of self-doubt” had descended on the process of departure from the EU.            To those already duped by Johnson, this was stirring, statesmanlike stuff.            It was nothing of the sort. Rather, Johnson’s resignation statement to the House of Commons was stuffed with meaningless platitudes which refused to acknowledge that the EU has every right to negotiate as it sees fit. It boiled down \u2028to a rather Trumpish “make Britain \u2028great again”, with neither detail nor \u2028logic playing any kind of part in achieving this.Throughout the referendum campaign and in the two years since, the Brexiteers’ response to legitimate questions about how exactly departure from the EU might be painlessly achieved has been to fall back on platitudes about confidence, as if somehow “self-belief” will protect sterling and prevent job losses.In Johnson’s cynically constructed fantasy world, if we walk meekly into a lion’s den, we should expect to be mauled to death. But if we hold our heads up and instruct the lion that we’re here to take back control of the den then the beast will roll over in defeat. Oh, and if that doesn’t work and the lion does eat you, well that’s the fault of all those people who told you not to go into its den in the first place. Having failed in the two years since he and Nigel Farage and sundry snake-oil salesmen won the referendum to come up with anything approaching a workable version of Brexit, Johnson took the coward’s way out. He did not resign because of principle (a concept entirely alien to the man), he resigned because he had no idea how to make that victory look like anything other than a spectacular act of national self-harm.May is not, even her fiercest critics would surely concede, a politician in the mould of Johnson. Charged with leading the UK out of the EU, she has to come up with ideas more substantial than “just be confident”. She has to engage with the real world – a real world in which the UK has no cards to play during Brexit negotiations with the EU.            Yet May has begun to show worryingly Johnson-esque tendencies.A call from the Prime Minister for the EU to “evolve” its position on Brexit, for example, is pure Johnson.Support for May’s white paper on Brexit – the document that provided rats such as Johnson and Brexit secretary David Davis with the excuse they required to flee the ship they helped sink – would require huge compromise (or evolution) from the EU which would have to be willing to allow the UK to retain the benefits of a trade deal while absolving us of any responsibility to honour the free movement of people or to recognise the jurisdiction of the European Court.Little wonder, then, that the EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has signalled his… let us diplomatically describe them as “concerns” over the document.            According to Barnier, the Prime Minister’s plan for a future trade relationship could weaken the single market and create burdens for business. The white paper, he said, opened the way to a “constructive discussion” but it had to be “workable”.Those labouring under the misapprehension that the EU is in the business of ensuring the UK gets precisely what it wants (whatever that is) will seize on that word “constructive”. They would do better to pay attention to his warning about the things being “workable”.In the febrile atmosphere created by cabinet infighting over Brexit, the fact that the white paper represents nothing more than a series of aspirations is frequently ignored. The arrogant assumption that the EU is obliged to take seriously proposals that would undermine the integrity of the institution might comfort true believers in the Eurosceptic mission but, meanwhile, back on Planet Earth, the reality of a no-deal Brexit looms ever closer.Johnson once said that when it came to Brexit, he was pro cake and pro eating it. A pithy little soundbite, to be sure, but one that assumed the UK could force the EU to make compromises in our favour.It is time, surely, for us to get real about what exactly we can expect from the EU by way of a Brexit deal. And what we can expect is nothing.            Yes, the EU might be willing to give a little here or there but it will only do so when such concessions are in its interests.The European Union will, inevitably, be weakened by the United Kingdom’s departure. This will be welcomed by Russian President Vladimir Putin along with various nasty little blood and soil nationalists around the word. And that, among other reasons, means the EU will want to do all it can to discourage other member states from leaving.It simply makes no sense for the EU to send a message that says a nation may walk away from the shared responsibilities of membership and then pick and choose what parts of the relationship it wishes to maintain.Countless analogies about divorce or golf club membership have been made in pursuit of driving home this point in recent months yet the ludicrous idea that the UK has cards to play persists.Barnier had said nothing to encourage the belief that the UK can strike a deal on Brexit. Rather, his remarks should remind us that our European partners have more important things to worry about than playing along with the fantasies of right-wing ideologues who insist cake may be both had and eaten."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772508.1532335042!/image/image.jpg","title":"key steps to move from start up to scale up firm","story":"        It has been over two years since the UK made the historic decision to leave the European Union, and the date for our formal exit is fast approaching. On 29 March 2019 \u0026#8211 at 11pm, to be precise \u0026#8211 the country will depart the EU.                 Details of the actual withdrawal process have continued to cause debate, but the \u2028UK government has been looking at how the country can take advantage of the opportunities Brexit may offer, \u2028particularly when it comes to our\u2028 expanding community of start-ups and scale-ups.             It’s true that new businesses have been rapidly springing up across the country – between 2012 and 2017 there were 3.5 million start-ups launched. This is impressive, and the UK government has improved access to finance, encouraging international opportunities for exports, and promoting tech skilled migration.             Collectively, these reforms represent a move to ensure UK SMEs will flourish post-Brexit. However, there exists a fundamental challenge for young companies – transitioning from a start-up into fully-fledged SME. The figures are startling – of all the companies established in the UK in 2013, only a little over half were still in existence by 2017. The challenge, therefore, is not so much encouraging the launch of start-ups, but ensuring they can effectively pass the three-year milestone and become a scale-up.So with that being said, what do entrepreneurs need to keep in mind during the formative stages of their business?Incremental steps You don’t have to look far to find a success story about a UK company that has, for example, raised millions of pounds worth of investment or is preparing to launch overseas. While this can be a strong source of inspiration, it can also compel entrepreneurs to set company milestones that are simply unattainable. No business model is perfect, which is why different elements of a start-up’s service or product needs to be tried, tested and refined in accordance with the demands of the market. This is known as pivoting, and as per the evolution of the business model, targets must also remain realistic.            Ultimately, growth needs to be measured through regular and achievable targets, helping to reduce the risks and costs involved in a decision should it fail to deliver the desired results. At these critical early stages, it is important to minimise risk and not expose the business to any unnecessary challenges. Take advantage of incubator and accelerator programmesThe time, money and stress involved in getting a business off the ground can take a huge toll on an entrepreneur. As a result, feelings of isolation and loneliness can be all too common and it is important that any business leader develop a proper understanding of the instruments available to support their growth. Thankfully, the UK boasts an extensive network of incubator and accelerator programmes offering guidance and mentorship, not to mention a fantastic forum to connect with like-minded entrepreneurs. When it comes to incubator programmes in particular, early-stage companies can form valuable connections with investors who are not only interested in investing, but also serving on the board to help with the strategic guidance of the business.             Take advantage of existing technologyDigital innovation is rapidly changing the way in which consumers and businesses interact, and now, demands and expectations for products that have an effective tech component are high. A survey of 2,000 UK adults by Studio Graphene recently found that half of consumers will leave a business’ website in just 30 seconds if it’s ugly or hard to navigate. Moreover, 24 per cent of the respondents said that in the past five years they had switched loyalty to a firm whose technology delivers a better customer experience.Having a strong business concept is one thing, but ensuring it is accessible and meets the demands of the market requires equal attention – a start-up must constantly strive to improve its offering. This doesn’t have to be an expensive venture and useful technologies are now highly accessible. Rather than always looking to create new solutions from scratch, many successful start-ups harness existing technologies. This will save a company time and money, helping to complement the resources already invested by a start-up in its own proposition.             The UK’s entrepreneurial future looks bright, and with local companies now at the forefront of disruption across established and emerging sectors, there is a need to ensure more entrepreneurs can transform their start-up into a scaling and profitable entity. Following these pieces of advice will help business leaders avoid common pitfalls that damage a start-up’s chances of success in turn this puts them in a stronger position as the UK heads for Brexit and beyond.

The emergency responders are set to start a full trial of the service next month following a pilot scheme and could cover all appropriate afternoon unscheduled house calls in the city by April next year.            Deploying paramedics to carry out house calls is one of a dozen proposals in the Edinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership’s Primary Care Improvement Plan, which has been sent to the Scottish Government for approval.            At least two GP practices in Edinburgh are already using paramedics for some house calls. House calls are not routinely counted or reported by health officials and can vary widely per practice. It is estimated about 500 house calls are made each weekday across Edinburgh.The new Scotland GP contract, which came into force in April, included reducing GP workload through the expansion of the “primary care multidisciplinary team”. Judith Proctor, chief officer of Edinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership, said: “The partnership’s Primary Care Improvement Plan ... is an ambitious redesign of primary care services.“We see this as the next stage in improving primary care for everyone.            “New models of home visiting for those people unable to get to a primary care centre include appropriately trained and supported paramedics undertaking initial triage in a model fully supported by doctors based back at the practice. “This enables us to visit people at home, as well as supports GPs seeing patients in the practice.”GP practices in Edinburgh have been under increased pressure since 2014. Around 20 of the city’s 72 GP practices have needed “additional support and attention” in order to provide services to registered patients. More than 40 practices in Edinburgh have restrictions on their patient lists.The primary care plan claims “a series of once-stable independent GP practices are no longer able to function without additional support”.            In order to carry out house calls, around 15 paramedics in Edinburgh have undertaken additional specialist training. Another 15 will undergo the skills programme by the end of this year.“Some house calls relate to lack of transport. Providing that would also maximise cost-effectiveness.”The Scottish Ambulance Service welcomed the move, following the successful pilot scheme, as did GP leaders, who believe the idea could help ease doctors’ workload.Dr Andrew Buist, deputy chairman of the BMA’s Scottish GP committee, said: “The new GP contract in Scotland aims to reduce workload pressures and re-establish general practice as an attractive career choice.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772399.1532289565!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch brexit puts our fruit farmers in a jam","story":"        Sharp fall in number of east European berry pickers since EU vote threatens bumper crop, writes Lesley Riddoch                Why are the problems facing Scotland’s soft fruit industry causing national unease? Last week MPs toured strawberry and raspberry farms in Perthshire and members of Common Weal and local Yes groups pondered online whether summer holidays should be ditched to save this year’s crop. Would such selfless gestures save the day? It’s uncertain.            The problems facing Scotland’s soft fruit growers are big, urgent and complex – they are also deeply symbolic. As an unwilling Scotland is forced to contemplate the food shortages that will accompany a hard Brexit, here we are watching perfectly good food being left to rot. That’s depressing at the best of times – symbolic of Scotland’s helplessness as we face an unwanted and damaging Brexit in less than nine months.            And deeply ironic too. Right now, hot weather has produced a bumper and slightly early soft fruit harvest, but Brexit has produced a collapse in the number of east European pickers willing to come to Scotland. A study carried out for the Scottish Government estimated 9,000 seasonal agricultural workers were employed here in 2017 – most on fruit farms. This was 20 per cent fewer than the industry needed, but there was worse to come. The survey found that 60 per cent of these workers were uncertain about returning to Scotland this year.Since then opinion among east Europeans has hardened. Rumours of a hostile environment in England have created uncertainty about conditions in Scotland too and this has combined with a tangible fall in the value of sterling against the currencies of neighbouring countries, which are easier to reach. Meanwhile improving east European economies can offer better-paid professional employment to their graduates than the manual labour that used to take them here. Apparently, many Polish fruit farms now employ Indian migrants to harvest crops. Times are changing.The result in Scotland has been pretty tragic. About 20 tonnes of strawbs and rasps were left to rot last week alone in Perthshire – Scotland’s soft fruit heartland. It’s an emotional issue – for politicians, would-be consumers and stressed-out growers.After all, Scots still generally have to be forced to eat vegetables. But no one needs encouragement to scoff strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and brambles by the punnet. Soft fruit and honey must be the only sweet things in Scotland that are also healthy foods. So the idea of abandoning truckloads of ripe berries is disturbing. So folk are asking why Scots aren’t capable of picking our own berries, as past generations used to do around Tayside and Angus, where travellers and Dundonians worked in the berry fields of Blairgowrie to create extra income, outdoor-oriented summertime communities and rich musical and storytelling traditions.             Can we revive those traditions in time? Probably not.First, there’s the scale and urgency of the task. William Houstoun of Angus Growers estimates 4,000 berry pickers are needed right now but there are only 1,400 \u2028unemployed and able-bodied folk in the area.Second, there’s a stack of deterrents in the benefits system. Growers report that unemployed Scots consider full-time picking jobs until they figure out that working more than 16 hours a week means losing benefits and winding up worse off. Universal credit adds to the problem. According to Citizens Advice Scotland, universal credit claimants must be available to look for work unless they are working more than 35 hours a week at the national minimum wage, in which case their universal credit claim will probably be closed. A neat wee Catch-22. And of course, anyone restarting a universal credit claim must endure a month at least without any cash to live on. Mr Houstoun says: “Many of our east European pickers came for three or four months over a period of four years to finance particular projects like going to university or building a house.” Sadly, our benefits system militates against Scots having such peripatetic and seasonal employment patterns.             A third problem is the skilled and specialist nature of the job. Picking and packing soft fruit without bruising them is a delicate task – made more so by the current spell of hot weather, which means picking starts at 4:30am to stop berries going mushy by the time they reach supermarket shelves. Supermarket deals provide a steady demand but mean low prices and high standards. Legislation to stop modern slavery and human trafficking can leave farmers worried about taking teams of workers to other farms lest they appear to be acting as gangmasters. Wage levels are a bone of contention. Berry pickers are paid on a piecework basis – if they don’t pick enough to earn Scottish Agricultural Wages Board rates the farmer has to make up the difference – so unskilled workers generally leave after a few days. Good pickers earn more than £10 an hour when the conditions are right. But growers insist this represents a fourfold increase in pay since the mid-1990s despite berry prices remaining static.Finally, school leavers want summer jobs to boost their CVs. They want Duke of Edinburgh awards or internships to help them stand out in the university application process. There’s a perception that manual work, including berry-picking, doesn’t demonstrate ambition or professional intent. And it’s illegal to employ youngsters below the age of 16.   So what does the future hold?            The next problem starts in autumn when crops ripen. East European berry pickers used to stay on for the apple and vegetable harvests but that may not happen this year. Ploughing in vegetables would be more maddening for farmers because harvesting costs are relatively low compared with the big cost of harvesting berries.  So some very tough decisions must soon be taken. The biggest worry for fruit farmers is a no-deal Brexit, which could mean no direct flights to Britain after March 2019, no incoming pickers and therefore no point planting soft fruit in Scotland. Imported Spanish strawberries could become the norm and Scotland’s traditional berry fields could switch to crops which can be mechanically harvested. This sour prospect might perhaps be averted if the UK government yields to industry demands and replaces the scrapped Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme, extending it to cover all European citizens. The other options are more difficult. Britain could quit the path to Brexit or Scotland could quit a Brexiting UK. If there is an easier solution, I’m sure Scotland’s soft fruit farmers are waiting to hear it."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772623.1532343676!/image/image.jpg","title":"uk s offshore wind output to double as government backs industry","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

It still sells well and is the most widely read text in the United States on any aspect of Scottish history.                 The book is part of his Highland trilogy, Fire And Sword, which also includes Culloden (1961) and Glencoe (1966). In the foreword to Glencoe, Prebble revealed his objective: “I have written this book because its story is, in a sense, a beginning to what I have already written about Culloden and the clearances – the destruction of the Highland people and their way of life.”            John Prebble (1915–2001) was born in England but emigrated, aged six, to Canada with his parents, later returning to the UK as a young boy of 12. It is suggested that early friendships among members of the Scottish emigrant communities in Canada first stimulated his interest in Highland history. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain as an adult but left after the end of the Second World War. However, Prebble never lost his hostility to the human impact of market capitalism or sympathy for its victims.            Many scholars have rubbished The Highland Clearances as a work of faction, or a fusion of fact and fiction, rather than a serious history. Predictably the book rarely features in the prescribed reading lists of Scottish universities, except perhaps as an exemplar of partisan historical interpretation. I recall a colleague once setting students the essay question: “Prebble’s The Highland Clearances is not good history but it is a good novel. Discuss.”But most readers seem not to care about the ferocious criticisms which the volume has sometimes attracted from members of the academy it continues to sell well long after his death. For the general public, Prebble tells a compelling story in very readable prose presented as a dramatic saga of betrayal, loss, tragedy and forced exile of the Highland clans from their native glens which in his interpretation remain empty to this day as silent memorials of man’s inhumanity to man.The author makes his own position perfectly clear from the outset: “This is the story of how the Highlanders were deserted and then betrayed. It concerns itself with people, how sheep were preferred to them, and how bayonet, truncheon and fire were used to drive them from their homes.” The book is an accessible and fluent read, in part because the author does not even try to come to grips with any of the many challenging complexities of Highland history. Those in the dock are always the former chieftains of the clans, by the later 18th century transformed into commercial landlords, whose greed, Prebble insists, led them to sacrifice their erstwhile clansmen for filthy lucre. At root, indeed, the volume is concerned with a classic struggle between the forces of good (the defenceless people of the Highlands) and evil (the brutal landlords and their callous lackeys, the notorious factors – estate managers – of ill fame). Prebble’s perspective on clearances had been fashioned by almost a century of earlier polemic, political and fictional writing which stretched back into the Victorian era. Most of the documentation in the book relies on these earlier works with little evidence of original research by the author. Almost all of this passionate oeuvre was produced at the height of Victorian controversies about clearances between the 1840s and the 1880s. It was deeply sympathetic to the people who had been displaced, strongly supportive of the vital need for land reform and bitterly hostile to what was seen as oppressive and brutal landlordism.            It was significant too that The Highland Clearances achieved bestseller status in Scotland during the late 1960s and 1970s, when the country first began to experience the early stages of deindustrialisation and rising levels of unemployment as the postwar boom petered out and the old imperial connections which had sustained the great heavy industries faded into the past. As the country started to move politically to the left, the history of the evictions became a symbol for the emerging tragedy of an economy in decline, the social impact of deindustrialisation sometimes being described as a modern clearance.This was also the time when Scottish nationalism finally achieved some electoral purchase with Winnie Ewing’s famous victory in the Hamilton by-election of 1967. Nationalism, clearances and victimhood soon became intimately linked by some polemicists, a tendency which has continued to the present day through the proliferation of social media. The contentions were that the historic tragedy of the Gaels had taken place during the Union and sometimes also, against all the evidence, that English landowners and sheep farmers were mainly responsible for the draconian acts of eviction.Prebble himself never claimed to be a historian and always referred to himself as a historical writer. He seems to have been taken aback by the storm of criticism generated in some circles by his book, especially by the intervention of the late Professor Gordon Donaldson, a former Historiographer Royal,who bitterly denounced Prebble’s work on the Highlands as “complete rubbish”.Some thought the furore simply reflected jealousy on the part of an academic establishment whose works might be scholarly and rigorous but could never hope to achieve a fraction of Prebble’s sales. It is also fair to say that he had tackled an important and controversial subject which most historians up until that time had studiously ignored or consciously avoided. But scholars were also right to be concerned that a book which some of them believed to be riven by bias and distortion, as well as being under-researched and devoid of much critical perspective, was widely accepted by the public as the authentic chronicle of clearance.             There is indeed still much to be said about this controversial and emotive subject. In my new book The Scottish Clearances, which will be published later this year, I return to the saga of the dispossession of peasant communities, not just in the Highlands but throughout Scotland between 1600 to 1900. Based on four decades of research, writing, teaching and reflection I see it as my most ambitious and challenging project to date.Sir Tom Devine is Sir William Fraser Professor Emeritus of Scottish History and Palaeography in the University of EdinburghThe Scottish Clearances: A History Of The Dispossessed 1600-1900 will be published by Allen Lane: The Penguin Press on 4 October at £25.00"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations.

Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

She has been a tower of strength since her diagnosis and during her time in America and we are so very proud of her.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866187.jpg--.jpg?1531813044000\n","title":"kittens get new home after being found by passer by","story":"  \nFOUR kittens have been rehomed after they were dumped at the side of the road in Portglenone.\n  \nThe black and white kittens were found in a box behind a hedge by good samaritan, Darren McFetridge.\n  \nDarren had been out on Thursday evening (July 5) walking his dogs around 7pm in Portglenone Forest.\n  \nHe went into the forest with his two dogs and around half an hour later when he was returning to his car he saw two of the kittens wandering around the road.\n  \nSpeaking to the , Darren said he immediately started looking for more kittens.\n  \nOn closer inspection he found two more kittens in a box behind the hedge.\n  \nThe cardboard box they were in seemed fresh as if it hadn\u0027t been there that long, Darren explained.\n  \n\n  \nDumped\n  \n\n  \nI think whoever dumped the kittens has possibly done it in the time that I was in the forest because I would have noticed them on my way in.\n  \nI think it is really sad that people will do this to poor, defenceless animals. \n  \nIt would have taken the person five minutes to bring them to a vets and they would have been rehomed without a shadow of a doubt.\n  \nDespite the kittens being left at the spot on the Gortgole Road they appeared to have been unharmed and \u0027perfectly healthy\u0027.\n  \nDarren waited on a friend to come and meet him where he found the kittens so they could transport them to Parklands Vets.\n  \n\n  \nRehomed\n  \n\n  \nThe vets confirmed to the Ballymena  that all four kittens were rehomed by the following morning.\n  \nA staff member at the vets said: All the kittens were perfectly healthy and they have now gone to a good home.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866293.jpg--.jpg?1531813307000\n","title":"ballymena nursery gets a gold star report","story":"  \n BALLYMENA Nursery School has received a glowing report by the Education and Training Inspectorate (Eti).\n  \nThe report gave the nursery school the highest award for overall effectiveness with “a high level of capacity for sustained improvement”.\n  \nIt follows an inspection of the nurserys at Trostan Avenue, Ballymena which was carried out on April 26.\n  \nIn the report the inspectors commented that the nursery school leadership “understand fully the changing needs of the children and wider community”.\n  \nJust last year the nursery school celebrated its 50th anniversary with a community party.\n  \nAs it sits on the site where Ballymena Castle once stood, the celebrations involved a “castle theme” with knights, princesses, court jesters, balloon modelling and face painting.\n  \nThe inspectors also commented that parent\u0027s written comments “praised the staff\u0027s dedicated professionalism and care in meeting the children\u0027s individual needs” and highlighted the nursery\u0027s positive reputation within and contribution to the community.\n  \nThe staff comments “endorsed the supportive and productive working relationships at all levels and the caring and positive strategic leadership of the principal”.\n  \nThe inspectors reported that both indoors and outdoors, the staff provide a “stimulating, richly resourced and well organised learning environment the wide range of authentic and natural resources and displays are easily accessed by the children to progress their self-reliance and to promote their active interest”.\n  \nThe inspectors also commented: “The children\u0027s personal, social and emotional development is a key strength.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"}]
