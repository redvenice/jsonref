It’s a strong start from the Canadian, who returns two blistering first serves to get to 0-30. Medvedev makes his opponent miss to get back to 15-30 but hits long and Auger Aliassime has two break points. Medvedev wins the first quite brilliantly but the No 9 seed gives him the second one with a stiff forehand that lands wide. Deuce. A huge smash brings up match point and then Medvedev roars with delight as Auger-Aliassime hits long. The No 2 seed survives after going two sets down. Incredible resilience against a hugely talented opponent.  There’s some brave tennis from Auger-Aliassime, here. He could easily sit back and try not to make mistakes but he goes after his shots and adds to the spectacle. A ill-thought drop shot allows Medvedev to get back into the game at 30-30 and then he outlasts the Russian with sumptuous hitting from deep at the back of the court to bring up game point at 40-30. He looks gassed after that last point, though, and can’t recover a stinging Medvedev forehand. Deuce. He serve-volleys to stave off the imminent threat of a Medvedev match-point but finds the net when he could put the game away. After a couple of bruising points, he finally gets there. Medvedev will have to serve for the match. The Canadian does still have something left. He forces Medvedev to thrash a forehand long at 40-30 and gets a chance at deuce. The Russian feels the pressure, double-faulting to give Auger-Aliassime a break point. But the No 9 seed has no answer to a brilliant flat, wide serve from Medvedev. Another fine save. Some incredible defensive play when the Canadian was dominating the rally keeps Medvedev in it at deuce. He hangs in there and will make Auger-Aliassime serve to stay in the match. Auger-Aliassime has struggled in the longer rallies and he does here again as his more experienced opponent takes the first point thanks to his better on-court craft. He still has that big first serve, though, and he uses it to great effect to get back to 15-15 and then he follows it up and dominates the next point from the net to get back in front at 30-15. Medvedev is superior in the next rally after jumping in on a second serve and then he hangs in there to force deuce. The Canadian still has enough in the tank to hold his serve but after another battling game has he got enough fuel left to attack Medvedev’s serve and break back?The Canadian’s ankle is wrapped up nice and tight and we’re back under way at exactly midnight in Melbourne. It’s a rapid hold to love. Medvedev must fancy getting some sleep. It’s way past his bedtime. Auger-Aliassime is struggling. He has a little wobble mid-game, finding the net with a weak backhand to allow Medvedev back into it at 30-15. The Canadian finds a big serve. 40-15. And then the Russian shows great craft as he wins a lengthy rally to recover to 40-30. Then the Canadian balloons a forehand towards Tasmania and we’re at deuce. Oh dear. He has enough in the tank to battle to game point and take it, though. An important hold. And then he calls for the trainer to get some more strapping applied to his ankle so we’ll have a little delay.I’m no psychologist but I’d be feeling a bit crushed if I was Felix Auger-Aliassime. He’s played amazingly well today but is heading for defeat unless he breaks the Russian again. The youngster is barely in this game, with Medvedev racing through the gears to hold to 15.  What’s this? A rare double fault from Auger-Aliassime! 0-15. A big first serve gets him level at 15-15 very quickly though … but then he tries to be too cute at the net and jabs a backhand volley into the net. Medvedev hangs in there in the next point and waits for the Canadian to err with a wild forehand. 15-40 and two break points! Oh dear. A second double fault from Auger-Aliassime gives Medvedev a crucial – potentially match-winning – break. It’s a tricky service game for the Russian. He struggles to get control in points and is very quickly facing two break points. He saves the first … and Auger-Aliassime tries but fails to dispatch a second serve to allow his opponent to get back to deuce. The Canadian is kicking himself after that but focuses his game again. Medvedev, meanwhile, misses an easy volley at the net to give the Canadian another break point. He saves this one with a huge first serve and then keeps his nerves in check to hold. Newcastle should consider signing Medvedev. He’s a great defender. Surely you have to fancy Medvedev now. Momentum is a powerful thing in sport, but the Canadian has won three of his four five-setters. Medvedev has won just two of the nine he has played in his career. It’s a comfortable hold for the Canadian here. He lands his first serve three times in a row and whips an incredible backhand winner down the line to bring up game point at 40-0. Another first serve and the game is his. The No 2 seed is full of beans now. Everything appears to be hitting the sweet spot until he double faults at 40-0. Maybe he’s feeling it too much because he fires a forehand long and then cedes ground to his opponent, with a weak return. Deuce! But then Medvedev wins an outrageous point – a volley that requires lightning quick reactions – and follows it up with an ace to take this incredible match to a fifth and final set.  Medvedev hangs in there on the first point and waits for Auger-Aliassime to get impatient and force a forehand long. 0-15. But then it is he who overjuices a forehand. 15-15. The 9th seed shows great craft as he pulls Medvedev around court before smashing home a volley winner to get his nose in front again. But Medvedev shows gumption again, getting back to 30-30 and then producing a lovely whipped backhand to bring up deuce. Auger-Aliassime errs again as he booms a forehand long to give Medvedev a break point. And the Russian takes it, showing great resilience and making the Canadian chase the point and hit wide. Medvedev will serve for the second set.It’s not an ideal start for the Russian, as he misses with a forehand to give the Canadian a chance at 0-15. But he sticks in there and a fine forehand down the line gets the score back to 30-15. “Ooooh!” The tension in the crowd is palpable after Medvedev hits long to give Auger-Aliassime another chance at 30-30. And then he has match point as the Russian double-faults! Is the No 2 seed about to tumble out? Not a chance! He booms down three big serves and roars with relief after a huge hold. Auger-Aliassime thrashes a tired forehand long to give his opponent a 0-15 lead but it’s soon 15-15 after a big first serve sets up a smash into empty court. Another error by the Canadian – a mishit into the net – gives Medvedev a sniff at 30-30. Auger-Aliassime hits wide wildly with a forehand and gives the Russian a break point. Is he feeling the strain? The first serve to bring up deuce suggests not. And another two thunderous serves take him a game away from the match. What a great show of character. Over to you Daniil. Medvedev tries to take the initiative by coming to the net but a weak backhand volley allows Auger-Aliassime to fire at the Russian’s body and take the first point. But, as in the previous game, this only enlivens the server. Medvedev holds to 15. Are we heading for another tie-break? Thanks John. After dropping the opening point, the Canadian gathers himself and blasts through to hold to 15. On we go. Medvedev showing signs of a malfunction? He’s lost a little of his verve but then holds to 15. They are racing through this set. Auger-Aliassime serves with venom to go to 40-0, and then serves to love. Backhand return winner, a rare one, starts off the Medvedev service game and then comes a double fault, his sixth. A big serve and then an overhead levels it at 30-30. Then the hold is on, and a big noise goes up from him. The Auger-Aliassime serve and forehand is still working, but Medvedev is playing better if still finding it hard to break his opponent. The last Russian break came way back in the first set, and he can’t do it this time, sitting down and complaining about something or other. Medvedev misses a winner down the line, feels a long time since that happened. He’s looking far better than before, that’s for sure. But Auger-Aliassime’s service return for 40-30 is brutal, only for Medvedev to hold and issue his own roar. This feels like a whole new ball-game, and Medvedev’s eye is in, as he goes to 30-30 on his opponent’s serve. He almost pulls off the impossible in a thundering rally but ends up losing it. Auger-Aliassime roars as he holds. Auger-Aliassime makes an early error, hitting the ball out for 0-1. Then misses his first serve, only for Medvedev to overdo his baseline shot for 1-1. Then a slip from Auger-Aliassime and it’s 1-2, a mini break. There’s some rain falling, and the umpire demands the roof is closed. Medvedev is only too happy to go and sit down to wait it out while the roof goes on, and the court is mopped. A tie-breaker it is. We arrive at 15-15, then a fine return from miles back from Medvedev opens the door at 15-30. An overhead levels it at 30-30. Then a timely serve that Medvedev spinnakers into the stand. Then the same is true of the next point. Medvedev wins a close-quarters rally to get to 30-0, then it goes to 30-30 with the Russian being given a chasing around the court. Then a service return takes it to 40-30, and a hold on first service. Auger-Aliassime must serve to take it to a tie-break.An unpromising beginning with a double fault is followed by the use of that forehand to win. Then that fails the Canadian to go to 15-30. Serve volleying then takes it to 30-30. Then he gets lucky with a net cord to drill a winner with Medvedev scrabbling. Then bullies home to save and hold. Now the pressure is back on Medvedev.  Medvedev continues to whinge at the ball kids. It’s their fault. And it goes to 0-30, the chance is on. But a good serve takes us to 15-30. And then it’s 30-30, the gap closed for now. And then Auger-Aliassime’s errors let back in Medvedev, who can get back into this with a break in the next. Medvedev is chatting to his coach as he makes a mess of a slight opening at 0-15. The coach, it seems, must take the blame. A huge smash from his opponent takes it to 30-15. Then some unlikely delicacy takes it to 40-15. The hold is duly completed. It’s a battle of the Medvedev serve and the Auger-Aliassime forehand that will decide this set, and the match. The Canadian messes up another drop, giving his opponent a chance to save, and we career towards the moment of truth. Medvedev can’t get through that serve but Auger-Aliassime makes a mess of a drop shot on game point. Still, he has two more, and a serve at 40-15 takes the cake. The first point is a classic, and one where Medvedev gets to show off the pace around the court that was supposed to be his ticket to the semis. His speed wins it, a serve wins the second but then comes 30-15. Auger-Aliassime overdoes a return on second serve as it goes to 40-15. Medvedev holds once more.  Big, big serving to go 30-15, right on the line. Then 40-15, again taking the full 25 seconds to unleash his bow. And on second serve, he lands the service hold. A steepled smash for 15-15 is followed by on overcooked forehand from Auger-Aliassime but 30-30 comes around too after a Medvedev miss. Then an amazing return sets up a break point. Medvedev goes for broke on his first serve and misses, but saves with a forehand winner. And then holds serve. A relief but all is not well in Club Med. A second-serve saver takes Auger-Aliassime to 15-15 as he looks far more nervous, and is slowing down his delivery. Still, he goes to 30-15 with a cruncher. Then comes another for 40-15 down the line, and the game. Medvedev can’t get through. Medvedev has only fought back from two sets down once before, last year at Wimbledon against Cilic. He’s put off by some squawking seabirds as he rabbits to himself and complains about the quality of the balls. The bad workman is blaming his tools with wobbles aplenty on show. He is taken to deuce. Then Auger-Aliassime misses a slice, only for another Medvedev error, then the Canadian nets for advantage. Medvedev holds but he is unhappy with life.

Photograph: iStockTaoiseach Micheál Martin has described a review into mental health services in south Kerry as shocking, very serious and unacceptable.Mr Martin said there will be a full nationwide audit of compliance with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) operational guidelines by all teams.He said a prescribing audit will also be conducted in each of the 72 Camhs teams nationally and the Government will look at “any further measures required”.The Health Service Executive (HSE) report published on Wednesday morning said hundreds of children received “risky” treatment from a doctor working in mental health in south Kerry and significant harm was caused to 46 of them.The review was into allegations that young people who attended mental health services in south Kerry were prescribed inappropriate medication.The review examined the treatment of more than 1,300 young people who attended the South Kerry Camhs over a four-year period.The risks involved in the treatment by the doctor included sleepiness, dulled feelings, slowed thinking and serious weight gain and distress, according to the review.Mr Martin was responding in the Dáil to Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall during Leaders’ Questions on Wednesday, who asked if there would be a wider inquiry into Camhs services around the country.Mr Martin said the findings demand “a fundamental review” of services, and not just those in south Kerry, and that it was not a “resources issue”.He said the first principle of medicine is to do no harm, but children had been harmed by “a complete failure of clinical performance and oversight and the entire management of the service”.“There was a systemic collapse here in terms of overall clinical governance and in terms of the overall management of the service,” he said.Mr Martin said there was a broader issue around recruitment of qualified personnel generally, “which we know we need to face up to”.Ms Shortall said the review was “shocking and distressing” for all of the families involved and that some children would have been waiting up to two years to access the service.“Instead of helping their children the service actually harmed them,” she said.The Dublin North-West TD said the treatment of the whistleblower involved, a locum consultant psychiatrist who has since resigned from the HSE, raises very serious questions about the treatment of whistleblowers in State agencies.HSE reportThe HSE report said: “This incident is the result a large number of events relating to the care and treatment of children, attending the Team A clinic, by a non-consultant hospital doctor, culminating in unreliable diagnoses, inappropriate prescriptions and poor monitoring of treatment and potential adverse effects. These events exposed many children unnecessarily to the risk of significant harm.”Having reviewed 1,332 files, the authors of the report found no extreme or catastrophic harm was caused to the patients in these files. Not all of the children who the doctor worked with were put at risk of harm, they found.The care and treatment of 13 other children by other doctors was also risky, the review found, and the authors found proof of significant harm to 46 children.This harm included production of breast milk, putting on a lot of weight, being sleepy during the day and raised blood pressure.The junior doctor whose work came under scrutiny did not co-operate with the review. According to the report, another staff member heard the person “was running a private treatment service from their home, sometimes seeing people privately up to midnight, and was also working in a private clinic in another county”.Enumerating the key causal factors behind events, the review said the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) for secondary school children was often made “without the right amount of information from their teachers on how the children were at school”.Checks of observations of unwanted effects of medications “did not happen”, including pulse, blood pressure, and height and weight.“These observations were not regularly checked or not recorded properly. Necessary blood tests were not always done. The doctor was not available for interview.“We believe that the doctor thought they were helping the patients and did not intend to harm the patients they treated.“The exposure of the children to risk and harm by the doctor was because of lack of knowledge about the best way to do things.”The review also identified key contributory factors including the fact there was no clinical lead for the Camhs Area A Team. “This was one of the reasons for failing to provide and keep a high-quality service.”In addition, there was no consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist from 2016 for the Camhs Area A Team.While another consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist agreed to cover the vacant post until it was filled, it was expected that it would only be for a short while.“It took much longer than expected to find someone to fill the vacant position. Not enough attention was paid to the possible risks while this job was vacant.”The consultant psychiatrist supervising the doctor did not see problems that developed throughout 2017 and 2018.ConcernsConcerns about the doctor were first reported in 2018, but no proof was found that these concerns were addressed after being reported.In 2019 concerns about prescribing medication were clear, according to the report, and the supervisor at the time advised changes but did not insist these happened.The doctor worked extra hours and was observed to be very tired at work, but this issue was not addressed.There was no system used to check the prescribing of medications or the quality of service by the doctor’s supervisors, the review stated.In 2020, the doctor was recommended for other jobs even though there were concerns about him. And while a new senior medical manager started in the service, the concerns about the doctor were not handed over to this person.According to the review, the service has not put in place many of the recommendations of the National Camhs Operating Procedure 2015 or the Camhs Operational Guideline 2019.It did not have updated treatment plans that were shared with the patient, their family and the person who referred them to Camhs, nor did it name a key worker in all cases, a team co-ordinator or a practice manager.The Camhs Area A team had a lot more referrals of new patients than other areas across the country, and this had not reduced at the same rate as other services.Some of the referrals that were not accepted were not dealt with quickly and were left awaiting on a decision of acceptance.There was no shared diary, and reception staff did not know who was coming in for appointments. “Staff cannot quickly know who is working on a case. All of this means cases get lost.”Rules on looking after case files were not being followed properly. Staff and doctors were able to take files from the file room without signing them out, against HSE policies on the management of health records.In addition, clinical information was not always recorded in the patient file.The review said there is proof of two referrals and 10 full case records being missing these have been reported in line with data protection rules.While the Camhs has a governance group, this did not check it was working safely and effectively, or talk about the risks of a long-term vacancy.ResponseResponding to the review, the HSE repeated earlier apologies it had made to the 46 young people and their families who suffered serious harm, and to all 240 young people “who did not receive the care they should have”.“Young people and their families are entitled to expect a high standard of care when they attend our services, and the report makes it clear that this did not happen in a large number of cases,” Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer of Cork Kerry Community Healthcare, which has responsibility for HSE mental health services in Kerry, said.“As chief officer of the organisation, I apologise sincerely to the young people and their families for this. I want to reassure the young people and their families that we have taken on board the 35 recommendations in the report, and will implement them as quickly as we can.”The review team was led by an external Camhs consultant, Dr Seán Maskey, from the Maudsley Hospital in London, who travelled to Ireland to carry out this work.The HSE has already apologised to about 250 families for substandard care identified in the review.The review was prompted by concerns expressed by a whistleblower in the health service who alleged substandard treatment of clients of South Kerry Camhs.The HSE initially looked at the files of about 50 young people who attended the service, after which it was decided to carry out a “look-back” review of all files between July 2016 and April 2021.The report was posted to affected families on Tuesday, and a copy has been sent to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly.The HSE is operating an information line for those affected – 1800 742 800 – which is open from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"working from home how quickly is high speed broadband being rolled out across the state","story":"Connecting the residences of 1.1 million people, 54,000 farms and 44,000 businesses in a system that will be seen on virtually every metre of every rural road. Photograph: iStockTJ Malone points to hoops of pristine white cable hanging from telegraph posts as he drives up a narrow boreen near Blessington, Co Wicklow, with grass growing in the middle of the road.The cables are a sign that this sparsely populated rural district will soon be connected to superfast broadband: “It’s a massive task,” says Malone, who is in charge of delivering on the promises made by National Broadband Ireland, the company responsible for the project.“It gets right down into every single village, every single home and any peninsula, including the islands,” says Malone about a project that will eventually cover all the parts the State – 96 per cent of the total landmass, in fact – where subsidies are need to make broadband delivery possible.With State funding of up to €2.6 billion in play, it’s big money. Private investors have pledged €175 million and additional sums if needed that would bring the total to €223 million. So far, the investors have paid in €120 million, including€20 million of it in December.There is no shortage of critics but NBI, whose chairman is Irish-American businessman David McCourt, is confident that it can complete the job under budget.Work has begun on supplying 151,000 homes and businesses. In time, it will rise to cover 554,000 locations – connecting the residences of 1.1 million people, 54,000 farms and 44,000 businesses in a system that will be seen on virtually every metre of every rural road.Fibre-optic cables stretching for 146,000km will go overhead for 89,494km – connecting 1.47 million telegraph poles, and those cables will run underground for 15,057km. And all of this is being done with the promise that the service will be “future-proofed” for 25 years, and capable of being expanded by a quarter.Despite complaints about the pace of the rollout, work is now under way in each of the 26 counties. In Dublin, some of the vast industrial estates at Ballymount on the city’s highly-developed western edges have been included.Strange as it may seem, such locations are not deemed commercially viable by market operators, thus bringing “rural broadband” within the bounds of the M50 motorway around the capital, in sight of the Red Cow roundabout.The delivery of broadband offshore is a different challenge entirely. A symbolic moment looms in coming weeks when the NBI system goes live on in four small Atlantic islands: Collanmore, Co Mayo and the Donegal islands of Eighter, EadarinisInishcoo and Rutland.Rural depopulationIf successful, it will be the spearhead of efforts reverse generations of rural depopulation, as important in the 21st century as rural electrification was in its day, reviving sleepy towns and villages of the countryside.Rural broadband was needed before 2019. But the pandemic has changed the way people think and the rise in demand for working from home requires superfast broadband to make it a reality.“The social and economic development of rural Ireland is integral to the wellbeing of our country as a whole and to our quality of life. Ireland’s economy, heritage and culture is heavily dependent on the contribution of rural areas,” said a Government policy document last year.“The availability of high-speed broadband services in rural communities will have a transformative effect, even in the most remote parts of the country. It will ensure equality of access to online services for people in rural areas.“It will create potential for improved social cohesion and economic growth and will allow people to pursue their careers without the need to relocate, as well as offering the potential to attract new people and businesses to rural locations.”If all of that points to pressure on National Broadband Ireland to get the rollout right, the project has proved contentious. Government approval in 2019 for the came in the face of forceful resistance from the Department of Public Expenditure. The Department opposed it on grounds of cost, affordability, value-for-money and Exchequer risks and it expressed concern that the State will not own the network once it is built.In addition, TDs and Senators are unhappy with coronavirus lockdown delays that left the project six months behind schedule. More recently still, the company and the Government dismissed outright media claims that an investment hedge fund had quietly taken a majority stake in the project, insisting there was no ownership change at all.“Bringing a private company on board to actually build it was the right decision,” insists Peter Hendrick, chief executive of National Broadband Ireland.Asked about criticism that the deal is too favourable to private investors, he points to “clawbacks” that give the Government a share of any savings on construction costs and an upside share of NBI revenues above certain targets.“The protection mechanisms they have in terms of clawbacks will provide all of the comforts that actually there isn’t an unlimited win here for shareholders,” he says.“Because the tender process went on for so long there’s very little ambiguity and every single scenario has been thought of. I would say the biggest winners here are probably all the law firms.”Technical complexityIn chilly Blessington this week, workers were busily installing 571km of cable to connect 5,006 premises in the area that do not already have broadband.Although the expansive lakes nearby and the imposing Wicklow mountains in the distance make for striking scenery, they add to the technical complexity of connecting the hinterland of a bustling country town that is near enough to Dublin to be in the city commuter belt. The number of premises ranks among the largest for connection by NBI in a single area, but Midleton in Co Cork will the biggest.The work now under way in Blessington is but the final part of a project in which everything has to be worked out in advance.“You don’t know until you dig,” says Aidan McWeeney, a national broadband worker who seems to know every single manhole in the Blessington area. “These are areas that haven’t been touched in decades unless there was a damaged cable. So it’s a huge unknown.”The planning includes route maps into inidual homes and schedules for tree-clipping to make way for cables overhead. The need for detailed records means that each tree is photographed, before and after the cuts, meaning NBI has thousands of pictures of trees on file.All told, surveyors examined more than 20,000 Blessington “assets” before any construction work started on the ground. The aim was to set out what exactly needed to be done at each site, quantify the materials required, identify any environmentally or archaeologically sensitive sites and ascertain the wayleaves and consents needed to traverse private and public property.It turns out that numerous homes in the area could not be connected without an agreement with the ESB to run cable along a bridge it owns near Poulaphouca reservoir. “Until we get access there we can’t finish out the 1,000 premises we need to do. Most of work will be done to it and it’s a case of just getting that done,” Malone says.Similar consents were required from CIÉ for 600 rail crossings around the State. Work cannot be done on national roads without the approval of Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the consent of local authorities is needed to work on other roads. That can take up to 12 weeks, eating further into precious time.Then there is the unpredictable. In spite of all the effort to start installing cable in Blessington, someone took a chainsaw to a row of six poles on one roadway. The matter is with the Garda.Progress has also been hampered by procedural “teething” problems. Malone tells how, in the early days of the project, NBI encountered a rejection rate “in the region of 40 per cent” when applying to some local authorities for licences to erect inidual telegraph poles. That “tortuous” system has since been streamlined, but it took practically a year to establish new guidelines to speed the process and boost predictability.“You pick up these learnings in the first year-and-a-half of a project,” he adds, arguing that the tricky groundwork done in the early enables the project to “snowball” as momentum builds later. “We spent two years to get 37,000 premises built and in the next three months we’ll get another 25,000 built.”The aim by the end of this year is to have the build completed at 127,000 premises, with the build commenced on 220,505 premises, and surveys complete for more than 380,000 premises.Making up for lost groundA couple years into the project, NBI is now in a race to make up ground lost during the first lockdown.The closure of hotels and other services interrupted NBI’s ability to carry out physical surveys of remote townlands, or to examine poles and cables. Only then could it be established what remedial work and new network infrastructure was required.The disruption was like heavy snowfall, says Malone, very real, but very quickly forgotten by those demanding faster action: “In the early stages of this we had guys who were travelling all around the country who had to go home at night. Then you had contractors who weren’t mobilised because they couldn’t get even facilities for somebody on the road to go to the loo. It’s as simple as that.”NBI has not been hit with financial penalties for missing targets, thanks to “reliefs” for the impact of communicable diseases. When the contract was drawn up, the fear was that something like foot-and-mouth could occur. Nobody then thought, or knew anything about, a pandemic such as Covid-19.But with coronavirus still not beaten and many broadband contractors absent this month because of omicron close contacts, the upshot of it all is that NBI now finds itself without any time to lose. Still, Hendrick insists the job can still be finished by its original 2026 deadline.After the Government pressed last year to accelerate the project, could the job yet be done by 2025? “We still have a chance,” Hendrick replies. “We’ll get it in on seven years if we’re aiming for something less and our objective is to aim for six.”There’s promotions happening now. So we would see the take-up being considerably higher than where we would have thought it was a couple of years ago.”But there are mountains still to climb. As of January 7th, the grand total of premises using the NBI service was 5,122. That number will have to grow and grow and grow for years to come.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and

targeted covid vaccine in us","story":"‘While . . . boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalisation with Omicron, we recognise the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time.’ Photograph:  Mahmud HamsAFP via Getty Images A clinical trial to test a new version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine specifically designed to target the Covid-19 Omicron variant, which has eluded some of the protection provided by the original two-dose vaccine regimen, has started, the companies said on Tuesday.The companies plan to test the immune response generated by the Omicron-based vaccine both as a three-shot regimen in unvaccinated people and as a booster shot for people who already received two doses of their original vaccine.They are also testing a fourth dose of the current vaccine against a fourth dose of the Omicron-based vaccine in people who received their third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine three to six months earlier.The companies plan to study the safety and tolerability of the shots in the more than 1,400 people who will be enrolled in the trial.“While current research and real-world data show that boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalisation with Omicron, we recognise the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time and to potentially help address Omicron and new variants in the future,” Pfizer’s head of vaccine research and development, Kathrin Jansen, said in a statement.Pfizer has said that a two-dose regimen of the original vaccine may not be sufficient to protect against infection from the Omicron variant, and that protection against hospitalisations and deaths may be waning.Still, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a third dose of an mRNA vaccine such as the PfizerBioNTech vaccine has provided 90 per cent protection against hospitalisation due to Covid-19.Some countries have already started offering additional booster doses, but a recent study from Israel showed that while a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine boosted antibodies, the level was not high enough to prevent infection by the Omicron variant.BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters in November that regulators would not likely require testing of an Omicron-based vaccine on humans because it and Pfizer had already created versions of their established vaccine to target the earlier Alpha and Delta variants, with clinical trials continuing.However, the debate appears to have shifted as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a statement on Friday that international regulators now preferred clinical studies to be carried out before approval of a new vaccine.These studies should show that neutralising antibodies in the blood of participants are superior to those elicited by current vaccines. Another desired feature of an upgraded vaccine would be for it to also protect against other variants of concern, the EMA said.The Omicron variant has replaced the Delta variant as the dominant lineage in many parts of the world and Omicron itself is now splitting into different subforms, one of which, BA2, is causing particular concern. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boris survives mess needs start governing conservative","story":"In the old silent movies, the hero used to extricate himself from his predicament accompanied by the words “with one bound he was free”. The phrase could serve as the political motto of Boris Johnson, dubbed the Great Houdini for confounding previous predictions of his demise.He awoke yesterday morning to find the front pages and TV news broadcasts focusing on a celebration of his birthday during lockdown in apparent breach of the rules. That’s it, said the pundits. All over. Yet by the end of the day, things didn’t look so clear cut.Ms Gray is said to have found prima facie evidence that eight parties breached lockdown regulations, which could result in fines for those involved, possibly even the Prime Minister. Were that to happen it might galvanise Tory MPs into firing off the 54 letters needed to trigger a no-confidence vote.With anger running high with the incessant drip-drip of allegations, Mr Johnson’s best hope of survival is for Tory MPs to shy away from the dislocation that would be caused by a leadership contest. In truth, he is less a Houdini than a Mr Micawber, always confident that something will turn up. Indeed, it already has with the threatened invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Mr Johnson took the chance to make a statesmanlike appearance in the Commons yesterday to call for Western unity in the face of the Kremlin’s aggression.In this he was performing the proper task of the Prime Minister but it allowed him neatly to contrast “Cakegate” with the stark realities of a real crisis. Moreover, when Labour’s Angela Rayner raised the latest revelations in the chamber, a claque of Tory backbenchers had been corralled to support Mr Johnson and emphasise the successful vaccine roll-out, the refusal to enforce tough controls during the omicron surge and the strong diplomatic position the UK has adopted over Ukraine.Perhaps the Prime Minister can see a way out of his plight, charting a path across the political quagmire that would see lesser mortals swallowed in the mud. But there are two questions here – not just can he survive but should he? Many say that his integrity and authority have been shot to pieces by the cavalier culture in Downing Street during lockdown, with staff blithely flouting rules the rest of us followed diligently.His supporters maintain it is ridiculous to topple a Prime Minister over such trivial matters. But that is not the point. Many of us felt the rules were disproportionate, but we obeyed them because they were the law of the land. We did so under protest but observed them none the less, in some cases even when it meant not being able to say farewell to dying relatives. It is hard to forgive insouciance in high places while there was such misery elsewhere. The law is not just for little people, as some in No 10 appeared to believe.However, the fact that there is now a police probe is not of itself a reason to resign. Tony Blair was interviewed twice in 2007 (though not under caution) in connection with the “cash for honours” scandal. At the time, Labour called it a “passing political hoo-ha”, while the Conservatives demanded Blair’s resignation “in the national interest”. Plus ca change...The parallel with Mr Blair is not an auspicious one for Mr Johnson, as the Labour leader left office a few months later to avoid a leadership challenge. Can the Tories engineer something similar, a deal to let Mr Johnson remain in No 10 before standing down later this year or early next? That would require the Prime Minister to agree and he shows no inclination to do so.Then there is the argument that, with war looming in eastern Europe, now is not the time to defenestrate a Prime Minister. In fact, there is a long history of getting rid of leaders in a time of conflict. Lloyd George replaced Asquith in 1916 and Chamberlain was pushed aside by Churchill in 1940. More recently, in November 1990, thousands of British troops had already been deployed to the Gulf when Mrs Thatcher was forced out by a Cabinet putsch.Mr Johnson seemingly retains the support of his top team – or at least no one has resigned as he did from Theresa May’s Cabinet, precipitating the crisis that led to her downfall. But the big question is this: if he manages to slither out of his immediate predicament, to what purpose? The eminent office he occupies does not exist simply to provide a vehicle for his greater glory. He remains Prime Minister under sufferance of his MPs who expect him to lead a government that is both competent and Conservative.More from News39 migrants feared dead as boat capsizes off FloridaUkraine latest news: US, UK considering sending \u0026#39thousands\u0026#39 more troops to Eastern Europe to counter RussiaSue Gray report latest: Boris Johnson refuses to resign as \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 inquiry findings loomBoris Johnson \u0026#39authorised Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animal evacuation from Afghanistan\u0026#39 despite previous denialAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebration‘Drill’ rapper who boasted about trafficking drugs in music videos jailedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"burns night blunder scottish government makes gaelic translation","story":"Her government spends millions of pounds a year promoting Gaelic and has ensured the language is plastered over everything from emergency vehicles to road signs.But Nicola Sturgeon’s administration was left red-faced on Burns Night after publishing an embarrassing translation error as Scots all over the world gathered to celebrate the country’s national bard.An official Scottish government social media account wished Scots all over the world “Oidhche Losgadh Sona”, in what was supposed to be a translation of “Happy Burns Night” on Tuesday, alongside an image of a traditional supper of haggis, neeps and tatties.However, the patriotic tweet, issued to almost 5,000 followers by the nationalist government’s devolved rural affairs department, backfired when it emerged that “Losgadh” was not Robert Burns’ Gaelic surname but the word for a physical injury caused by heat or chemicals.And while some names do have Gaelic translations, this does not apply to Burns, Gaelic language experts confirmed, and speculated that a hapless official had merely typed the greeting into Google Translate before publishing it to the world.Donald Cameron, a Scottish Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands who took his parliamentary oath in Gaelic last May, said: “Whoever was responsible will be sat eating their haggis with a bit of a red face tonight.“It is just as well Burns showed more attention to detail in his works, than this official did in this tweet.”In its most recent budget, the Scottish government committed £25.3 million in taxpayers’ cash to Gaelic learning and a further £3 million to a “Gaelic Capital Fund”. Last year, it published a 48-page Gaelic plan, in which it hailed the language as “an integral part of Scotland’s heritage, national identity and current cultural life”.A devoted Gaelic government agency, Bòrd na Gàidhlig, is based in Inverness and is tasked with overseeing the plan.Among their roles is to advise the Scottish government on “Gaelic issues”.Another of its missions is to “influence national and international events and celebrations… to ensure Gaelic is featured prominently.”However, it appeared that civil servants had failed to consult an expert at the agency, which employs the equivalent of 19 full-time workers. The tweet was swiftly deleted after the error was pointed out by Roger Hutchinson, an author and journalist.He tweeted: “So glad the Scottish government has a salaried Gaelic officer, who trusts Google Translate to know the difference between heat burns (losgadh) and the surname Burns (Burns).”More from NewsUkraine latest news: US, UK considering sending \u0026#39thousands\u0026#39 more troops to Eastern Europe to counter RussiaSue Gray report latest: Boris Johnson refuses to resign as \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 inquiry findings loomBoris Johnson \u0026#39authorised Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animal evacuation from Afghanistan\u0026#39 despite previous denialAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebration‘Drill’ rapper who boasted about trafficking drugs in music videos jailedRoyal Navy being a taxi service for migrants crossing Channel will \u0026#39damage its reputation\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"plan b covid measures finally lifted dont expect end government","story":"Perhaps you’re pleased about the lifting of Plan B Covid restrictions today and aren’t overly concerned about the spread of the mercifully mild Omicron variant. Well, don’t be so hasty. With Russian military forces massing on the Ukrainian border, we might have war in Europe, and from there might even stumble into a third world war. Beset by official inquiries, police investigations, constant leaks, rumours of leadership challenges and no confidence votes, Boris Johnson’s Government has been scrambling to shovel weapons to Ukraine while publicly warning off Moscow. As the viral dystopia of lockdown and public restrictions finally draws to a close, the dystopia of a great-power war with a nuclear-armed state beckons. As if geopolitical tension with Russia were not enough, the British Government seems equally keen to embroil itself in Sino-American rivalry in the Asia-Pacific. Beyond that, there is also the climate crisis to look forward to.One crisis ends, and we roll into another. Before the Covid-19 pandemic and the prospect of war with Russia, there was the global war on terror to chisel away at our civil liberties, empower governments to strip away citizenship, justify the expansion of the security state and mass surveillance, as well as a series of endless wars. As was widely noted at the time when US president George W Bush launched the war on terror, the fight against an abstract noun could never be won, anymore than a highly mutable coronavirus can be fully eliminated. Yet the war on terror went ahead regardless. The Western withdrawal from Kabul happened in August last year – only once the biosecurity state was already firmly entrenched in the US, and over 10 years after the killing of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.The war on terror came less than 10 years after the end of the Cold War. This was another period in which emergency politics had been institutionalised in the form of constant preparedness for war, the  menace of nuclear annihilation, bloated national security states and recurrent red scares to quash dissidents and enforce compliance. Why did rule by permanent emergency last for so long across the second half of the 20th century, and now for over two decades into the twenty-first? Why do the richest, most technologically sophisticated societies in human history seem unable to form legitimate governments on the basis of normalcy?Doubtless part of the answer lies with the bureaucracies and various security agencies that become established under one emergency and then need to perpetuate themselves. As the history of the 20th century shows, emergency laws are also difficult to scrub out once legal precedents are established. There is also the appeal of ersionary foreign policy. The Ukraine crisis is convenient for Boris Johnson’s floundering Government, just as much as the Al Qaeda terror attacks were for President Bush, who won the White House in 2000 on the basis of a Supreme Court decision rather than a popular majority.Fear also has the advantage that it is self-perpetuating. The more the politics of fear disintegrates the possibility of social trust and collective action, the more civil society fragments, the more fearful iniduals become. Emergencies also conveniently undercut the need to articulate political visions of the future. The British lockdown began on March 26 2020, only 55 days after Britain belatedly exited the EU. Instead of ushering in a new era of national freedoms, the same party that had campaigned on the promise of getting Brexit done established a biosecurity state in short order.Yet observing the political opportunism of struggling leaders and self-interested bureaucracies still begs the question – why do we accept the normalisation of emergency as politically legitimate? The appeal of the politics of fear for governments is obvious enough. Identifying its appeal for ordinary citizens is less so. Perhaps the ultimate reason fear works is less that it liberates states to abuse their power, and more that it exonerates us from having to take collective political responsibility for ourselves.Philip Cunliffe is Senior Lecturer in the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Kent.

Obama and Sarkozy were famously caught moaning about Benjamin Netanyahu in 2011. “I cannot stand him. He’s a liar,” muttered Sarkozy. “You’re fed up with him?” retorted Obama, “I have to deal with him every day!” Gordon Brown’s “bigoted woman” gaffe prompted a row that all but destroyed his political career, and who could forget Prince Charles’s comments about Nicholas Witchell on the ski slopes of Klosters? Yet such moments can be as revealing as they are funny – and often as destructive.This week provided another hot mic for the ages. On Monday, President Biden was addressing a meeting held by the White House Competition Council, a group that works, among other things, to help consumers deal with higher prices. A laudable aim, you might say, with US inflation at a four-decade high – itself a compelling topic to reporters. But not, apparently, if you’re Joe Biden.The President had yet again refused to take media questions, so at the end of the session, reporters began yelling them out instead, hoping for an off-the-cuff response. “Do you think inflation is a political liability in the midterms?”, tried Peter Doocy of Fox News. The President responded sarcastically, apparently oblivious to the still-running cameras and microphone.“It’s a great asset, more inflation… What a stupid son of a b----”, he scoffed, half petulant teenager, half pub bore being reluctantly kicked out at closing time.Such moments should be more remarkable than they are, yet Biden has committed so many faux pas that they barely count as “gaffes” these days. Last week, he lashed out at a reporter who pressed him on remarks suggesting that a “minor incursion” by Russia into Ukraine might prompt a lesser comeback from the US than a full-scale invasion. “Why are you waiting on Putin to make the first move, sir?” asked Jacqui Heinrich of Fox News. “What a stupid question”, Biden chuckled.The crumbling of Biden’s once-convivial facade is a particular surprise, marking, as it does, the destruction of one of the President’s few remaining virtues. In his inaugural address, he pledged to heal a bitterly-ided country – vowing to “end this uncivil war which pits reds against blue”, promising “decency, honour, respect, treating people with dignity.” This was the kindly grandfather who would unite a nation with a new brand of grown-up, moderate politics – and restore America’s reputation after the chaos of the Trump years. The last year has certainly disabused voters of that fond vision.Biden’s personal approval ratings are the lowest at this stage of any modern presidency besides Trump’s – and they have plummeted from a greater polling height than his isive predecessor ever managed. First, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan scorched Biden’s “competency” selling-point, then his radical domestic agenda (plus the surging criminality visible in many Democrat-controlled cities) harmed claims of “moderation”. On a host of issues – lockdowns, higher taxes, open borders, law and order – Democrats sit well to the Left of the US public. And now his administration’s testy reactions to criticism are upending the much-vaunted “nice guy” persona, too.White House press secretary Jen Psaki has become famous for her scathing put-downs to reporters’ questions (gushingly nicknamed “Psaki bombs” by fans). Yet witnessing her in action gives an overwhelming sense of sneering condescension that same tendency to shrug off inconvenient questions. She recently laughed off a query about how the Government was preparing for the winter supply chain crunch, by dismissing a crisis affecting everything from medical supplies to food as “the tragedy of the treadmill that’s delayed”. Such a remark isn’t just crass it suggests either an astonishing ignorance about voters’ lives and concerns – or something closer to contempt.Fake news appears to be thriving in the Biden administration, too. Just last week, Psaki name-checked Florida as an example of a state that had “done little” to distribute state funds to keep schools open. This was an odd choice with or without federal help, Florida has remained open for in-person instruction since August 2020, while many Democrat-run areas still cleave to remote teaching. Why, exactly, did Psaki single Florida out? Was it because the state has challenged mask and vaccine mandates, and other draconian rules imposed nationally, or simply that Democrats see its popular governor Ron DeSantis as a threat?The old game – ”imagine what the press would have said if Trump had done X” – may be something of a fish-in-barrel exercise now, but it’s inconceivable that such craven tactics would receive such glancing media treatment.On the rare occasions they are scrutinised, the Biden team usually ducks accountability by citing the hand they were dealt by Trump. Rarely do they take responsibility for their errors, or show any sign of reflecting on how their policy machinery might have led them there. Not being Trump was always Biden’s biggest selling-point, but as his administration lunges from one crisis to another, it appears to be all they have left.More from NewsSue Gray report latest: Boris Johnson refuses to resign as \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 inquiry findings loomBoris Johnson \u0026#39authorised Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animal evacuation from Afghanistan\u0026#39 despite previous denialUkraine latest news: Kyiv mayor mocks Germany\u0026#39s delivery of 5,000 helmets, asking \u0026#39what next, pillows?\u0026#39Australia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebration‘Drill’ rapper who boasted about trafficking drugs in music videos jailedRoyal Navy being a taxi service for migrants crossing Channel will \u0026#39damage its reputation\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"voters tiring labours legalistic boris hunting","story":"For a confident opposition leader who truly believes in what he and his party have to offer, it is obvious how to approach a prime minister hit by crises and scandals: you call for a general election.“Let the people decide” is a battle cry that is hard to argue against and stresses a politician’s respect for democracy and the instincts of the electorate.So it is telling indeed that Keir Starmer has not so far adopted such an approach to the partygate scandal, instead delighting in new twists and turns in the official process of investigation – from the Cabinet Secretary, to Sue Gray, to the politan Police – and continually demanding Tory MPs ditch the PM.Just as when he was one of those relying on the legal establishment to thwart Johnson’s effort to enact the democratic will on Brexit, so Starmer is once again expecting processology to knock-out an opponent Labour has never been able to defeat at the ballot box. Even now he has a handy opinion poll lead, he sticks with the approach of a lawyer rather than a leader.And it isn’t only Starmer who seems obsessed with enacting the removal of Johnson by order of the establishment. So does most of the broadcast media which leads its news bulletins on the latest breathless tales of social gatherings in No10 for day after day, week after week, no matter what else is happening in the world. Again, the atmospherics are reminiscent of the peak of the effort to block Brexit in autumn 2019.Despite the gulps which will have been caused throughout Downing Street by the police starting an investigation into its partying ways, my impression is that the fury towards Boris Johnson is starting to dissipate, at least among conservative-minded people. Tory MPs certainly report a dying away of email volumes about the matter. The conservative thinker Phillip Blond last night tweeted: “Out with 12 Tory MPs tonight across the range of the party – all think Boris will win a confidence vote and hopefully repurpose his Government around a real Red Wall agenda and all feel the alternatives to Boris Johnson are worse.”This is no thanks to the efforts of some of the PM’s supposed allies such as Conor “ambushed by cake” Burns or Crispin Blunt, who decided to turn his guns on the great British public, accusing millions of them of having flouted lockdown laws themselves. Polling by YouGov indicates how wide of the mark this is, with YouGov finding 68 per cent of people never knowingly broke lockdown rules at any point in 2020. No doubt Tory-leaning households, which tend to be older and more law-abiding than average, will feel especially aggrieved by Blunt’s unwarranted accusation. With friends like these, who needs enemies?Johnson has enemies aplenty of course, even on his own side. Ruth Davidson, former Tory leader in Scotland and no admirer of his, tweeted that her partner shared a birthday with the PM and she recalled her own experience of the day of his tea party in No10 as follows: “We marked it in 2020 by inviting one other household to sit outside, socially distanced, in our garden. It didn\u0027t occur to us – literally couldn\u0027t conceive – that we would act outside the rules.”As it happens, a relation of mine has a birthday around the same time and we did similar. And very nice it was in the sunshine of that glorious early summer. But that just serves as a reminder of the first lockdown and the fact that most of us weren’t desperate to meet up in large groups indoors for a spot of partying, but were in fact locking down out of self-interest – to keep ourselves safe from a deadly plague that had descended from out of the proverbial clear blue sky. Johnson and his inner-circle did not have the option of cutting themselves off from workmates, which probably explains why so many of them – Matt Hancock, Chris Whitty, Dominic Cummings and the PM himself – contracted Covid in the first wave, when treatment was by trial and error and the fatality rate was at its highest. Unsurprisingly, it was the larger man among them who got it worst and nearly died.If Boris Johnson did knowingly break his own lockdown laws and is prosecuted for it then of course he will have to go. If the long-awaited Sue Gray report is damning enough of him then there is still a significant chance that Tory MPs will bring him down via a confidence vote. But neither of those prospects now seems very likely to me. Johnson would seem to have an alibi of sorts for all the key lockdown infractions – the say-so of a senior civil servant in the case of the garden party, not being there in respect of the Christmas bash and leaving dos, having a surprise birthday gathering inflicted on him by his no doubt well-intentioned other half on June 19, 2020.Given what his administration was demanding from the rest of us, he deserves a rap on the knuckles and perhaps to be marked down by voters for presiding over a “booze culture” of sorts, with his own ready recourse to the wine bottle in working hours likely to have been taken as a cue by others among the 200 or so folk based in the large office building also known as 10 Downing Street.But to be driven from office over the heads of the voters by Keir Starmer’s monstrous regiment of nit-picking lawyers? I really don’t think so. As Jacob Rees-Mogg was probably trying to suggest in his erroneous pronouncement that a general election would necessarily have to follow any forced removal of Johnson, politicians and the media would do well to remember that in a democracy the most important mandates are given by the people.More from NewsUkraine latest news: US, UK considering sending \u0026#39thousands\u0026#39 more troops to Eastern Europe to counter RussiaSue Gray report latest: Boris Johnson refuses to resign as \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 inquiry findings loomBoris Johnson \u0026#39authorised Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animal evacuation from Afghanistan\u0026#39 despite previous denialAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebration‘Drill’ rapper who boasted about trafficking drugs in music videos jailedRoyal Navy being a taxi service for migrants crossing Channel will \u0026#39damage its reputation\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"radical plan would scrap universal","story":"Radical plan would scrap Universal Credit and guarantee everyone £. a weekThe Commission on Social Security has outlined plans to replace DWP Universal Credit with a Guaranteed Decent Income that would be paid to anyone whose earnings drop below a £. thresholdthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video universal-credit-pension-payment-rates-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:aNxfoA,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

From April the minimum Universal Credit rate will be around £ a week for over-s, with top-ups for those with housing needs, children and disabilities. But the Commission, whose leaders all say they have “lived experience of the benefits system”, say this should be scrapped and replaced by a new system. Central to it would be a ‘Guaranteed Decent Income’ of £. a week for all adults, including multiple adults in the same household. This is similar to a Universal Basic Income, but instead of being paid to all adults rich and poor, would target those whose earnings slip below the £. threshold or who don’t earn at all.  Child benefit would be set at £ a week, more than double the £. for the eldest child now, and Personal Independence Payment for the disabled would range from £. to £.. The plans were drawn up by the Commission, an organisation that looks at radical reform of the benefit system and is funded by inequality campaign group Trust for London.  The plans are not costed but Commission secretary Michael Orton claimed they would be a “post-war”-style investment that paid for itself through savings in other areas and a more healthy and prosperous society. Dr Orton, of the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick University, said: “The pandemic showed that when times were tough it was unpaid carers, supermarket workers and others on low incomes who kept our society going. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The day nursery manager, who is mum to six-year-old Noah, said: I wanted to make sure I was here for my son and that I was fit enough to run around with him. That was why I decided to do something about my weight. I always knew one day I would lose it. I just never knew when. Amy wore a size  at her heaviest and hated seeing her reflection, but was finally shocked into action by her festive photos from Christmas  following months of comfort eating after a relationship ended.Amy, who stands at ft in, had a body mass indexused to gauge a healthy weight, of  - compared to the NHS healthy range of . to . - making her dangerously obese.With the support of her best friend, Lucy, , she joined a diet club online, started exercising in earnest and watched her waistline shrink until she felt like she had a brand new identity. Now wearing a size - with a healthy BMI of ., she said: “My real friends will tell me, aposYou were beautul then and you are beautul now.apos Some people have said, ‘I always knew there was a beautul face in there.’ But I’ve not done this for anyone , I’ve done it for me.  “I’ve always been the ‘Big Girl.’ I wasn’t bullied at school, because I hung out with the popular girls, but when they all had boyfriends I didn’t. “And I always hated PE and having to get changed in front of other people at school. “Throughout my le, when Iaposve looked in the mirror, Iaposve hated what I saw, as I just didn’t love myself. Remembering how she and her brother were fussy eaters and refused to eat vegetables as children, Amy also realises now that her parents splitting up when she was nine accentuated her already unhealthy relationship with food. She said: “My brother and I just ate crisps, potatoes, bread and sweets. “After my parents split up, we lived with my dad and I remember stepping onto the scales in the bathroom for the first time when I was  and being horried because I weighed st. It really hit home, because I knew my dad weighed st, so not that much more than me. ” After leaving school, Amy trained in childcare at college and landed a job at a local nursery, where she worked for  years. Then, seven years ago, she moved to the nursery where she works now, saying: I am very determined. “Once I have made my mind up to do something, then I don’t lose that focus.” And while she spent half of  comfort eating, after splitting up with Noahaposs dad in the May, she soon called on that gutsy determination to tackle her weight problem once and for all. She said: “I’ve always had a big appetite, so I’m not sure whether it was comfort eating or just the fact I didn’t care much about my weight after Noah’s dad left. Whatever the reason, confronted with photos of herself at her  Christmas celebrations, she was shocked into slimming with gusto. Confiding in Lucy, a clothes and shoe shop assistant manager, she said: “We’ve been best friends since we were  and although we were chalk and cheese physically, we really love each other, so I knew she would support me. Too shy to go in person to a slimming club, instead she joined WW online and was soon off to a roaring start.  And Lucy was there boogying alongside her when she started following hour long YouTube dance exercise videos. Amy said: “We both love dancing and when we go out, that’s what we do … we dance, so it was the perfect exercise plan for me to start with.” Each week Amy, who now restricts her calorie intake to , a day, weighs herself on a Sunday, which is also her ‘treat’ day. Preferring savoury to sweet things, she will still forgo all snacksher weight has gone up, so she can get back on track. She said: “I know people are surprised by my determination, because they’ve seen there’s nothing I won’t say no toit means keeping my weight healthy. “As a result, I’ve only gained weight about five times since losing it and I’ve always managed to lose it again. “A pizza is my all-time favourite food, but I will say noI need to. Another thing that happens when you lose this much weight is your digestion changes, so you then have to be careful about what you eat. Luckily, exercising alongside her weight loss has also helped Amy to reduce the apron effect experienced by many people, who have had drastic weight loss and end up with large folds of loose skin. She believes using a weighted hula hoop was key to toning up as the pounds fell away. At first, she ended up with bruises to her hips and thighs when she used it but is now an expert and can keep the hoop circling around her waist for an hour at a time. She said: “I’ve lost .ins from my hips and . ins from my waist - which now measure .in and .in - thanks to working out with the hoop. “When I started this, I couldn’t even run for a bus. Now, I run three times a week on my treadmill at home which is the equivalent of - miles each week. And Iaposm hoping to do a k run for charity.” Not only has her weight loss made her feel physically better, Amy says that psychologically, she feels far more positive. “I can go into any clothes shop and wear anything I want now and when I look in the mirror, I like what I see, she said. “I’ve learned to love myself and although it sometimes still doesn’t feel real, I know that I’ve achieved this. “People tell me I am an inspiration and that makes me so happy I want to cry. But even better, I can now race Noah across the field and run around with him in the park.”Amy’s main advice to her , WW Community followers and people who follow her on Instagram - @ww__ - is to never give up on their own weight loss goals.She said: “If you have a bad day or a bad week or a bad month, just move on and start again. “I’ve had a motto for some time now which is, ‘I can and will. Watch me.apos This, basically, says to anyone that ever doubted what I was capable of, that actually it is and was possible. As for Amyaposs son, Noah, he just has one question for his mum. She said: He asks me, aposWhere’s your tummy gone apos”To learn more about WWaposs PersonalPoints programme visit ww ukAmyaposs Before Diet Breakfast - nothing Lunch - Sausage roll, crisps, chocolate, fizzy drink Dinner- Chicken Kiev and chips Snacks - chocolate and Cadbury yoghurts Amyaposs Diet Now Breakfast - overnight oats, Greek yoghurt and fruit Lunch - sweet chilli chicken and couscous, with fruit salad pudding Dinner - Salmon fillet with vegetables Snacks - fruit, rice cakes, protein yoghurtDo you have a weight loss story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BullyingFitnessWeight loss success stories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As Boris Johnson scraps restrictions to save his own skin, we need to convince everyone to get a Covid jab. And that means hitting them where it hurtsA woman gets a Covid jab in Kent Image: Grant Falvey LNPopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan Get jabbed, or . It sounds harsh – and it is – but the time has come where it’s essential. Because we’re on our own now. Boris Johnson is forcing people to pay for his career with their health and, inevitably, in some cases their lives. To please his right-wingers and try to cling to power he’s dropping most Covid restrictions from tomorrow, to the alarm of the scientic and medical communities.Even isolation after a positive test will apparently be scrapped by March. It’s unlikely this government will bring back restrictions ever again, no matter what. The best thing we can do to protect ourselves is get vaccinated and boosted. Then your chances of catching Covid are reduced, but evenyou do, you’re much less likely be seriously ill, or – crucially for society – to spread it to others.  “If everyone who was offered a vaccine and booster would take it, the pandemic would be effectively over in richer countries,” claries the consistently reliable Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. Getting vaccinated is good for us personally, and for everyone  too. It is the very clear way out. What’s not to love  The Get Boosted campaign was a start, but now it needs to go a stage further. The vaccine hesitant – those who are afraid, because they’ve genuinely fallen for untrue propaganda – need to be persuaded. The ­militant, rabid anti-vaxxers will never be persuaded, so they need to be forced. No excuses. Too many people who happily put meals containing who-knows-what chemicals into their bodies, or those who ingest recreational drugs cut with let’s-not-even-go-there have said they won’t have the jab because they don’t know what’s in it. Unless you’re a food chemist or a drug dealer, no one knows what’s in anything! The vaccine has been tested and proven. Get jabbed, or . French President Emmanuel Macron ’s strategy is to “p*** off” the unvaccinated by making daily le more and more dficult for them. Tres bien, but not far enough. The unvaccinated must become social pariahs. They shouldn’t be allowed into indoor communal spaces like restaurants, cinemas, shops, gigs and – yup, the most bitter of all blows – pubs.Why should those of us who are jabbed and boosted have to risk breathing in their maskless air  If they don’t like it, they know exactly what they can do about it. Perhaps we should even make unvaccinated patients pay for the NHS care they are statistically so much more likely to need after refusing their jabs  Maybe the money should go directly into the pockets of the exhausted doctors and nurses who will have to treat them, seeing as they’ve unnecessarily added to their back-breaking workload. This tough love, cruel-to-be-kind tactic really is our only option now. We’ve tried personal responsibility, arguing and attempting to reason with brainwashed Facebookers. Enough. Get jabbed, or .

Brits are proving keen to head to traditional hotspots like Spain, Italy and Portugal. Mr Heapy said: Before yesterdayaposs announcement demand was already strong, however bookings have jumped by another % when compared with the previous week, demonstrating just how much of a game-changer the removal of all testing is for fully vaccinated holidaymakers.  With international travel starting to look like it did before the pandemic, customers are jumping at the chance to book their flights and holidays. Andrew Flintham, managing director at tour operator Tui, said the announcement was a huge leap forwards in getting travel back to normal. He went on: The relaxation of testing rules has already resulted in an increase in bookings, with customer confidence growing every day in recent weeks. We now look to the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to adopt the same approach. Many families look to go on holiday over the February half-term, so we are delighted these changes will come into effect in time. Going abroad will finally start to feel more normal again and without the added expense of testing.  Mr Flintham said he expects holidays bookings for this summer to be back to pre-pandemic levels.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claimed the change in rules will bring international travel back to the good old days.The Cabinet minister told LBC: You will be able to come to this country, andyouaposve been fully vaccinated, in other words two vaccinations, you will not need to take any tests at all, either before you leave to come here or when you get back here. Of course, no quarantine. In other words, kind of back to the good old days. Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye welcomed the easing of restrictions for people arriving in the UK, but warned many destinations still require travellers to take tests. He told Sky News: We need to get the tests lted at the other end of the journey, because for most countries you might need to go to you will still need testing before youaposre allowed into those countries. So thataposs something weaposll work on. Among the destinations which require arrivals from the UK to take a Covid test, eventhey are fully vaccinated, are Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Morocco, mainland Portugal, Switzerland and the US. The UKaposs most popular foreign holiday destination, Spain, does not require testing, but only fully vaccinated visitors are permitted to enter.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"every covid rule being lifted","story":"Every Covid rule being lted tomorrow as Plan B ends - and restrictions that remainBoris Johnson announced that Plan B Covid rules introduced to combat Omicron will end in England this week.

This means that mandatory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, work-from-home guidance and the need for Covid passes will all be axed, despite rates of Omicron infection still surging across the country. UK will revert to Plan A with a focus on vaccine rollout, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid warning last Wednesday that itaposs not the end of the road eventhe number of cases are falling.This means that the end of Plan B does not mean the end of restrictions altogether. Here are the rules being removed tomorrow and what will remain. What restrictions will be removed when Plan B ends As of Thursday, January , Covid passes for large venues will end. However, Boris Johnson said that venues would have the right to choose on whether or not they want to continue with the policy.Work-from-home guidance ended last week, with people ing to offices almost immediately after it was axed. Similarly, face coverings are no longer a legal requirement in public spaces including transport and shops. Face masks will also no longer be required in classrooms. Though the government no longer mandates wearing masks in any setting, Johnson added urged that people should still think about wearing a mask when in public environments, particularly in crowded or enclosed spaces. Restrictions on visiting care homes will also be eased. But Mr Javid warned that the end of Plan B shouldnapost be seen as the finish line. He urged people to continue taking protective measures including washing hands, ventilating rooms and self-isolatingpositive. Anyone who has yet to receive their Covid vaccines are also being urged to come forward. Which Covid rules will remain   Along with self-isolating for at least five full daysyou get a positive Covid test, the requirement to take lateral flow tests when travelling internationally will remain in place. While legal requirements stay in place for now, Johnson said he hoped to not have to renew self-isolation rules when they expire on March . He added that the aim is to remove the legal requirement for people to isolate after testing positive and replace it with advice and guidance as the virus becomes endemic.  For now, anyone planning to travel abroad need to book and pay for a Covid test before coming back to England - although this will change on February  from amyouaposre double-vaccinated. From now until then the test - either lateral flow or PCR - will have to be taken after you arrive back. If the test comes back positive, you need to self-isolate. Those who arenapost fully vaccinated need to book and pay for day two and day eight tests. You will also have to quarantine at home or the place youaposre staying for  full days. If youaposve been fully vaccinated then you donapost need to isolate for  days unless you test positive on or before day two.Everyone also needs to complete apassenger locator formbefore travelling back to the UK.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusPlan BOmicron iantBoris Johnson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tenants of Dorchester Court, a private estate of around  residents, discovered last week that drinking water to two flats tested had lead levels several times higher than legally allowed.While lead pipework is banned for new developments, some older properties including Dorchester Court have still not replaced them, MyLondon reports.Ben Archard, a leaseholder on the estate, is worried about the health of his two young children. While the lead levels in his flat are below the legal maximum, there is no “safe” minimum for lead in drinking water.  At high levels, lead can build up and cause poisoning, with babies and young children at risk of developmental problems. After learning of the lead piping on the estate several years ago, Mr Archard estimates he’s spent £, on bottled water, going through a five-litre bottle every day. He told MyLondon: “The effects of lead on children can be quite extreme. We’d rather take the hit than risk our childrenaposs health.The tenants’ union requested tests and were refused until we approached the council. “The management company are not interested in improving things unless they’re forced to by Lambeth Council. They don’t give a damn. Lambeth Council is now testing more flats and could compel the estateaposs owner to make urgent changes to the water supply. Mr Archard says he pays around £, a year in service charges to freeholder Manaquel Ltd and estimates the companyaposs additional rental income after tax may be around £m a year.He added: “Where is all the money going  They could have replaced the lead pipes easily with that kind of money coming in.”Dorchester Court resident Estella, who has two children, also relies on bottled water and hit out at the landlordaposs alleged slowness to respond to concerns over lead levels.  Freeholder Manaquel Ltd is owned by the property tycoon Heinrich Feldman, who has featured on the Sunday Timesapos Rich List with a net worth of more than £ million.Residents have previously described him as a rogue landlord after a string of problems on the estate.A Lambeth Council spokesperson said: “Lambeth Council is doing all it can to support residents at Dorchester Court which is a privately-owned estate. “Following complaints raised by tenants and leaseholders about living conditions on the estate, an inspection by the council found traces of lead in the water supplied to two flats. “The council has been liaising with the freeholder, and across agencies including Thames Water, in managing the situation. We have ensured residents have been supplied with safe drinking water, and we have given the occupants advice about how to stay safe while we carry out further testing...There are no plans to take enforcement action at this stage.” MyLondon has seen an email from the management company, Property Partners, confirming the high lead levels in two of the four tested flats. It says: “Please do not drink the water from and of the taps within the flat.We are arranging for drinking water to be delivered to the site…This will be distributed to all flats until the results of the testing are received.” In a statement, Property Partners told MyLondon they planned to replace lead pipes as part of a wider planning application currently with Lambeth Council, which includes building new penthouse flats on the estate. A spokesperson said: The replacement of lead pipes across the estate forms part of a wider planning application which is shortly to be determined by Lambeth. The only way to replace the lead pipes is to have residents vacate their flats as floors and walls will need to be exposed to undertake the works... In the interim Lambeth are testing ious flats across the estate over the next week or two with a view to working with usany short term remedial works are required.It is important to note that four flats have been tested to date, two passed and two failed, one of which was vacant meaning there was standing water in the pipes. We hope this provides some clarity and we would like to reassure you that we are working closely with Lambeth to ensure the safety of all residents. The Dorchester Court Tenantsapos Union is calling for the lead pipework to be replaced without relying on the planning application. In , residents faced hot water outages in the winter and in October that year, emergency services attended a major carbon monoxide leak from temporary boilers.Some residents were taken to hospital in an ambulance for check-ups. Heinrich Feldman has not responded to requests for comment.

City of London Magistrates’ Court heard self-styled “international DJ” Maressa Innerarity, who also goes by the name Carmen London, was not the event’s organiser but arrived with her own sound system. Prosecutor Nathan Paine-Davey said this is enough to charge her with holding or being involved in holding a rave type gathering in England of more than  people indoors. Innerarity admitted the offence on the first day of a trial.The party was held three days before an alleged Downing Street flat party on the same day as Boris Johnson ’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and communications director, Lee Cain, left their roles.The prosecutor said: “This relates to November  and . The defendant has been charged with an offence against the public protection coronavirus restrictions regulations which were in force on November , .“On November , the police were called to Poyser Street as a result of a complaint of noise from a resident in the block of flats. They believed that there was some sort of event going on. When police arrived they met with local officers and they could hear loud music coming from the location and approximately  to  people in the street leading up to the location. A cordon was placed on the street. At that point, police entered the building and stopped the unlicensed music event. It is believed  to  people were in the premises. Itaposs described as a squat - itaposs a warehouse-type building with very low ceilings. The court was shown police body-worn footage of attendees “pouring out” of the venue after officers shut down the event.  Mr Davey-Paine said: She accepted at the scene the music equipment was indeed hers and she was then warned she may well be prosecuted under the regulations. Clearly it was unlikely that that number of people would gather in such a space simply to have a chat. I donapost say the defendant organised it but the presence of her musical equipment and obviously she has been employed as a disc jockey previously. There is no evidence she was in fact operating that equipment. Eric Kawoya, defending, said Innerarity had been asked by two friends named aposGabriel and Jamalaposthey could borrow her sound equipment. He told the court his client did not know the equipment would be used for a party. Mr Kawoya said: She packed them in the car and drove to the venue. She was not told what kind ofwas taking place. When she arrived at the venue at the time the place was empty but as time went by, people started to arrive. She had cause for concern and she asked what was going on and they said to her not to worry. She then stayed around. She was not given any sort of money for this. She couldnapost leave because she was concerned for the safety of the speakers and damage to the speakers.The court heard Innerarity has not worked in two years and is on Universal Credit.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  District Judge Tim Godfrey said: It was a loud gathering to all intents and purposes, a rave was held there. It was sufficiently disturbing to neighbours that police were called. Most signicant of course this was during the national lockdown that began on November . That is a fact of which you were aware as of course was everyone at the event. It is clear from the video footage that people were crowded into a cramped location. It was a blatant breach of the lockdown and coronavirus regulations in force at the time. You said you didnapost appreciate what they would be used for but it was inconceivable that you did not appreciate the gathering was used for some kind of unlawful gathering during the lockdown.It is hard to imagine an event more likely to spread Covid- than the sort of event being held on this occasion.What those attending may have been willing to risk is not only their own health and wellbeing, they risked the health and wellbeing of others who they may be in contact with subsequently and they may be more vulnerable. Those who attended this event were acting in a supremely selfish way. Innerarity, of Tooting, south London, was fined £, and ordered to pay £ prosecution costs and a £ surcharge.

They were messaging on their Microsoft Teams work chat – not text or WhatsApp, as I guess it’s far less likely anyone would find those messages. I grew suspicious because he kept talking about this woman in glowing terms, saying how great she is at her job and how young and energetic she is. “Amazing” is a word he used a lot to describe her. She’s  years younger than he is and is also married!There was nothing overtly sexual about the messages, but they were flirtatious and intimate.They were also arranging to meet up after work to play squash and have dinner. I was so shocked – we’ve been together for more than  years and I never imagined I couldn’t trust him. It seems so out of character. I’d love your opinion on next steps. Coleen saysWell, the first thing you need to ask yourself is do you want to stay with him and try to make the marriage work If the answer is yes, then you have to ask him why he’s looking for another woman to provide something in his le. What’s your relationship lacking and why isn’t he talking to you about it  This kind of thing is so hurtful – it is a betrayal of your relationship. And he was obviously “hiding” the messages, thinking that you’d never go snooping on his work devices. I do think this is a symptom of a relationship that’s struggling, so it’s important to be really honest with each other. You need to work through what’s gone wrong and to seethere’s anything to build on. Maybe the best route to help you do this is relationship counselling.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveMarriageCheatingRelationships\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Drivers are likely to face fines and points on their licencethey fail to adhere to the amended rules, which are being implemented across the UK.Department for Transport is enforcing a new aposhierarchy of road usersapos from Saturday January , . It will ensure that pedestrians and cyclists face greater protection on roads and at crossings.The new guidelines are split into three categories, all with a focus on making roads safer for non-drivers. So, hereaposs everything you need to watch out for with the brand new Highway Code rules. What are the new Highway Code  rules  Rule H Hierarchy of Road Users  The Hierarchy of Road Users is the main focus of the Highway Code  rule update and the concept centres around protecting those most at riska road collision occurs. Pedestrians have been identied as the most vulnerable group, leading to their place being at the top of the new structure.The Highway Code outlines that cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists are also part of this group. It also highlights children, older adults and disabled people being more at risk.Therefore, the new hierarchy structure will lead to road users - who have the ability to cause the most harm during collisions - having the greatest responsibility to keep other road users safe.  In particular, the guidelines state that drivers of a selection of vehicles will be facing the most scrutiny on the roads. It states: This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, vans minibuses, cars taxis and motorcycles.A Department for Transport spokesperson told The Mirror: The Department has established a working group of key organisations to ensure that messages about the changes are as widespread as possible. And our well-established THINK! campaign will continue to ensure all road users are aware both when these changes come into effect and beyond. Rule H Pedestrian priority  The  Highway Code update has outlined that drivers, cyclists. drivers, motorcyclists, horse-drawn vehicles and horse riders must now give way to pedestrians who are crossing or waiting to cross the road, at junctions into which or from which you are turning. Previously, vehicles and cyclists were given priority at junctions, but the rules now mean that this is no longer the case. Pedestrians continue to have priority at zebra crossings, and vehicles must give way to cyclists and pedestrians at parallel crossings. Cyclists and drivers must also give way to pedestrians at light-controlled crossings when the green signal appears. Another rule update now means that cyclists need to give way to pedestrians on shared-use cycle tracks. Rule H Cyclist safety  From giving way at roundabouts to overtaking cyclists, a number of rules have been amended to improve cyclist safety as part of the hierarchy restructure. Drivers across the UK are now advised not to cut across cyclists, horse riders or horse-drawn vehicles when turning in or out of junctions, or changing lanes. In a huge shakeup to the rules, the  guideline amends also mean drivers must now give cyclists priority at roundabouts under Rule . It now states: You should give priority to cyclists on the roundabout. They will be travelling more slowly than motorised traffic.  Give them plenty of room and do not attempt to overtake them within their lane. Allow them to move across your path as they travel around the roundabout. Cyclists must, however, stay in the left-hand lane, while signalling right to ensure they alert driversthey arenapost leaving the roundabout at the next turning. All the other  Highway Code rule updates you need to know Overtaking other road users While previous guidance stated drivers needed to give cyclists aposas much room as possibleapos when overtaking, Rule  has now been updated.  The guidance is now as follows: Leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists at speeds of up to mph. Give them more space when overtaking at higher speeds. When it comes to horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles, drivers must now not exceed speeds of mph and there should be at least two metres of space. Drivers should also leave a minimum of two metres of space when passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road. Cyclist road positioning  Cyclists may now drive in the middle of a lane, in order to make themselves as visible as possible. However, they are to move to the left of the laneit is safe and the following applies:Cyclists are on a quiet road or street and a faster vehicle approaches Cyclists are in slower-moving traffic that then speeds up, in order to allow for faster vehicles overtaking Cyclists are in an area of a junction where it would be unsafe for drivers to overtake youTurning Left Rule , which previously advised cyclists to keep an eye out for vehicles turning left ahead at a Í›, has now become Rule .  The rule entails cyclists looking out for other cyclists or motorcyclists around them before signalling. They are also encouraged to avoid riding on the inside of vehicles slowing down to turn left or indicating that they are turning left. The new guidance adds: If you are turning right, check the traffic to ensure it is safe, then signal and move to the centre of the road. Wait until there is a safe gap in the oncoming traffic and give a final look before completing the turn. It may be safer to wait on the left until there is a safe gap or to dismount and push your cycle across the road.  This amendment also highlights the importance of Rule H, and says that cyclists must give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross now. Opening the door A brand new addition to Rule  is new guidance to open your car door in a way that allows you to check for others, highlighted in the new hierarchy, who may be passing.The update reads: Where you are able to do so, you should open the door using your hand on the opposite side to the door you are opening. For example, use your left hand to open a door on your right-hand side. This will make you turn your head to look over your shoulder. Passengers in cars are also instructed to look all around, using their mirrors, before opening the door of their vehicle.

Taking inspiration from London le, with a focus on home furnishing accessories and a brand-new food offering, IKEA Hammersmith will feature everything customers know and love about the Swedish retailer, at their ease.This is the latest step in IKEAaposs journey to become more affordable, accessible, and sustainable, as well as adapting to their customersapos evolving shopping behaviours, reports the Express.The new, compact store, allows visitors to pop in and purchase their favourite home furnishings as opposed to it being a typical IKEA big day out. A great environmental achievement for the store, IKEA Hammersmith has been awarded a BREEAM ‘Outstanding’ certication, a sustainability rating given to less than one percent of UK new non-domestic buildings. Some of the sustainability measures include ensuring that itaposs easily accessible, with links from four tube lines and  bus routes, and the opportunity for customers to trade in selected used furniture for IKEA vouchers. Peter Jelkeby, Country Retail Manager and Chief Sustainability Officer at IKEA UK  Ireland said: As shopping habits evolve and city centres continue to be redefined in the wake of the pandemic, this new store format marks the next step in our business transformation as we strive to make IKEA more accessible, affordable and sustainable. For the first time, Londoner’s will be able to take the tube to an IKEA store, pop in, grab a yellow bag and buy all the home furnishing accessories that make a house a home. They will also be able to explore the whole range, for delivery to a convenient collection point or directly to their home. Customers can look forward to a focus on home accessories and soft furnishings room sets will bring to le urban living, while larger home furniture pieces will also be on display and can be ordered for home delivery or delivery to nearby collection points. The well-known Market Hall, where customers can usually find impulse buys such as candles and vases, will be replaced with products located next to the room sets they represent. This is an effort to help customers with items already in mind, or for those looking for inspiration. IKEA is obviously known for its sheer size, but IKEA Hammersmith will be approximately one quarter of the size of a traditional IKEA store.

Health experts have issued a medical warning regarding his activities, saying that all donors and patients should be treated at a licensed UK clinic.Mr Jones, , himself told Derbyshire Live heaposs had a lot of people question him over why he does it, but believes they would understandthey saw the happiness it brings to the families he provides his free donations to. He said: Iaposm probably the worldaposs most prolic sperm donor with now being at  aposbabiesapos, well,  babies born, nine ongoing pregnancies. I might continue for another few years. Get to  anyway. I know of clinics and sperm merchants with greater numbers but they donapost donate, but rather sell semen. I think people would understand morethey saw the messages I get and the photos of the babies with very happy mothers. I feel the happiness it brings. I once had a grandmother message me thanking me for her granddaughter. I do it for free, though sometimes ask a bit for petrol. Itaposs illegal to charge and doesnapost seem right to take money when I have more than them. Mr Jones, who has three grown-up children of his own, said: It all started in May, over nine years ago. For some people, having children is very important as it was for me. I read in some newspapers the plight of some people that canapost have children. Reading the newspaper, it explained how people were using Facebook to make arrangements. I thought I could help so I put a post on one of the sites. I wasnapost expecting any response with me saying how old I was, but I had a lady in Derby contacting me within an hour asking me to help that evening.  Iaposve not advertised Iaposm a donor in years. It has not quite worked out as I had guessed, Iaposm just as busy now and have so many people contact me through people just talking, referring. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has issued a medical warning regarding Mr Jonesapos activities, saying that all donors and patients should be treated at a licensed UK clinic. A spokeswoman for the authority said: As the regulator of UK fertility treatment and research we donapost have the powers to stop people from making their own arrangements for sperm donation but we do want to help them get the information and advice they need to make the best informed choices, which is why we always encourage both donors and patients to be treated at a licensed UK clinic. If arrangements are made outside of the clinic environment there can be medical and legal risks, for example, without the proper consents in place the donor is likely to be seen as the legal parent, with all the rights and responsibilities that involves. Clinics will also rigorously test all donors for medical and hereditary illnesses. That’s why we always encourage sperm donors and patients to go to a licensed clinic, where these medical and legal issues are taken care of for them, and where the welfare of the child is always of primary concern.  Mr Jones says heaposs been married since , but now lives apart from his we who he says is not at all happy about what he does.Back in , Mr Jones appeared in  Men  Babies, a Channel  documentary which follows the lives of four men who donate their sperm for free to women who contacted them online. A clip from the show was featured on Gogglebox, which has received more than four million views on Facebook. Of the  children he claims to have fathered, Mr Jones says heaposs met around  of the babies which are located within around a -mile radius of Derby, including in Birmingham, Stoke and Nottingham. After first making contact, Mr Jones says he then gets to know the couple, who are often same-sex or cannot have children of their own, and discuss when their ovulation cycle is. He said he then places the date on his planner, and when he gets the call saying ovulation is only hours away, he jumps into his van and drives close to where they live. Describing how he does it, Mr Jones previously told Derbyshire Live : I drive somewhere where Iaposm not likely to be disturbed and go into the back of the van and pull the curtains down. Then I take the cup and a syringe so the stuff canapost come out, put a bag under my arm and text them to say Iaposm outside and Iaposll be round in three minutes. If that doesnapost work sometimes they suggest I meet them in a car park. I can tell how nervous they are. No other donor does it from their van normally, they go to the front door and ask to use the toilet.

The Primrose Court estate in Huyton, Liverpool, made headlines after a video taken three years ago, describing it as a apossh*tholeapos was posted to Tiktok last week and viewed over  million times. Today little has changed from the scenes in the video, which show windows and doors smashed in or boarded up, burned out houses with the roof missing and enormous piles of trash - some of which has allegedly been there for years. The estate is considered unadopted land by Knowsley Council who say they canapost afford to step in, after developers failed to finish construction of the road and street lighting after they went bust in . Now residents, who are forced to provide their own street lights, have accused the council of being too scared to step in because of trouble from outsiders, who relentlessly fly-tip the street.  One resident who has lived on Primrose Court for four years with his young daughter said outsiders prey on the unadopted street - knowing that without council supervision there will unlikely be consequences for their crimes. He said: “The smashed out windows and burned down houses have been there for years. Itaposs outsiders coming in dumping their rubbish, setting fires in the street and fighting. “If you come again next week it won’t look like this because we’ll have all pitched together to clean it up, but it won’t be long before they come back and dump more rubbish. “Some of the rubbish has been here for years. I think the council needs to do something because that’s the real problem. Nobody owns the street. “Of course it bothers the residents, we don’t want to come out and look at the street like that or come out and see mess everywhere.  But Knowsley Councillor Ken McGlashon claims the problems lie with the landlord who he says told the council and Primrose Court residents at a meeting we treat you like s**t because you live in a s**thole. He claims the council has suffered a £ million cut to its budget by the government leaving it unable to pick up the bill to fix the estate after the developer failed to hold up their end of the deal. Coun McGlashon said: It’s not a council matter because we don’t own the property.  “It must be horrible for the poor people, I feel sorry for them but what the hell can you dothe developer doesn’t do their job and the council can’t afford to pick up the bill. “This is a quote from the landlord when we met with them “we treat you like s**t because you live in a s**thole”. Thataposs the quote from the landlords themselves. But the majority landlord of Primrose Court has furiously refuted the claim adding that the council has refused to help and is even asking residents for council tax - despite having no involvement in the estate’s maintenance.  Colin Bell, managing director of A Properties, is the acting landlord of  properties in the close, which has  houses in total. Seven of those are derelict and the remaining five others are privately owned. Mr Bell claims that at a meeting with the council in September , council workers agreed that they would initially cover a £, bill to finish the street lights and road, the cost of which would have been repaid by A Properties in full over - years. But he adds that since that meeting, nothing has been done. Mr Bell said: We have over  house and  per cent of our problems come from Primrose Court. We were quoted £, over two and half years ago to put the lighting in and do the road which would have made all the dference.  “The council are saying they can’t afford it but they’re wrong, we were going to pay the council back for those works. I don’t know how a council can’t find £,. Dismissing the councillor’s claims that he ever described the tenants as ‘s**t’, Mr Bell said: “That is an absolute load of rubbish, we are the only landlord there and I certainly havenapost had any meeting with any councillor and said our tenants are s**t. “I think the council has every right to take over those properties and I don’t know why they haven’t done it because they’re short of properties to rent out, they have people on the housing waiting list, and they have these properties that they could have easily taken over… but they haven’t done it.” A Knowsley Council spokesperson said: “Knowsley Council did not build the properties at Primrose Court and has never owned them. All of the properties are privately owned. “Many of the issues at Primrose Court arise because the development was built by two separate privately owned companies – both of which went into liquidation without completing the work on site and without meeting the planning conditions for the developments. This meant that the usual processes for adopting the highway, installing street lighting etc could not be followed. The current property owners appear to be expecting the Council to use a considerable amount of public money to complete a privately owned development. “The Council has been in regular dialogue with the homeowners and landlords of properties in Primrose Court since initial issues arose in the area. A number of Council services, including Housing, Highways, Environmental Health, and Crime  Communities, have worked with homeowners and landlords to identy solutions to the issues on site, try to identy sources of funding, and agree a collaborative approach to tackling the issues that are evident. “For example, the Council met with some of the owners to discuss co-funding highways and infrastructure improvements to bring the road up to adoptable standards. At that meeting, the owners who attended agreed - in principle - to co-fund this work. Unfortunately, some of the other owners who did not attend that meeting subsequently refused to agree to contribute their shares, which would be required to progress the adoption of the road under a Private Streetworks Agreement. The Council has established how much the work would cost should an agreement ever be reached, but these costs are only going to continue to increase as time passes due to the poor original construction of the road by the developers. “Unfortunately, the Council is not in a position itself to fund all of the work which is required on site. Over a ten-year period, the Knowsley Council has been one of the hardest hit local authorities in the country by Government funding cuts – the Council’s budget has been cut by % and it has had to find £m worth of savings. Funding works to a privately-owned development would not be appropriate, particularly in that context. “In response to the specic comments made by Mr Bell of A Properties, the Council has never agreed to temporarily cover the cost of street lighting or highways works. We have offered to provide support in other ways such as advising on the specication of materials and construction methods, but we have never agreed to cover the cost of the works, temporarily or otherwise. The suggestion that the Council is “too scared” to finish the street lighting is completely untrue – We have simply never agreed to do that work. Council services regularly visit Primrose Court to provide a range of services, such as waste collections, social care, education, housing support, street scene, and environmental health. Our Crime and Communities team has secured funding to install CCTV, once other improvement works have been completed. Just like anybody  in Knowsley, residents pay Council Tax because they access a very wide range of Council services. The dference for residents in Primrose Court is that they have bought or rented houses in a development which was never finished. “We take action against any reported incidents of fly tipping including removal of rubbish and working with our partners and the local community to identy those responsible and pursue enforcement action. In addition, Merseyside Police continue to patrol the area and has conducted a number of search warrants. “Despite the very clear challenges, we continue to look at solutions to tackle the issues being experienced. The standards at Primrose Court are not acceptable and we remain committed to working with the owners on collaborative solutions to resolve the issues for all concerned.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Council taxHousingKnowsley CouncilCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Noor, , said her son Declan had opened a bottle of fizzy pop which exploded and her daughter Scarlett, eight, was singing and dancing along to Fridayaposs performance.Scarlett and her six-year-old sister Harriett were dressed in yellow Belle gowns while Declan wore a shirt and bow tie for the big theatre event. But they were forced to leave during the interval due to the reaction in the audience and missed the end of the show, reports Teesside Live. Have your say on the theatre drama in the comment section Emily, from Bishop Auckland, County Durham, was so sad to see Nooraposs children leave early that she put up a post on Facebook offering to pay for them to see it again.The project manager had attended the show in Sunderland with her mother after receiving tickets as a Christmas present from her children Lorcan, four, and Orla, two. She was able to trace the family of four thanks to social media and generously purchased them front row tickets for them tonext month. Emily said: There were lots of little girls in Belle outfits and it was quite cute. I noticed a little girl a few rows ahead of us getting really into the show. She was dancing and singing, it was absolutely beautul. But I could see the looks that people give you when your kids are not acting the way theyaposd like them to. I noticed a young couple sat next to them get up and leave or move. Emily recalled seeing the childrenaposs mum get up and take them out of the theatre. She had her coat on, she continued. The little boy was sobbing. I thought they are leaving because of the way that everyone was looking at them. I could hear people chuntering about it. A grown man walked past and said thank f*** theyaposve goneapos. I thought, aposyouaposre a grown man at a childrenaposs Disney production.apos I get that itaposs expensive but she paid for the tickets as well. It was awful. I just felt really depressed for the kids that they werenapost going to see the rest of the show and upset at the way people were reacting. Emily said her mother was heartbroken to see the young children miss out on the showaposs magical ending and she poured her energy into putting things right. In a Facebook post, she told how she would like to personally pay for the family to revisit the show maybe a matinee with less grumpy adults. In less than two days, she had tracked down Noor thanks to the appeal which was shared around , times. She said: I woke up to a couple of messages saying I think this is the lady and it was. It was amazing, I didnapost think I would find her. I donapost think she believed me. She said aposyou donapost have to do thatapos and I said aposhonestly I want to, Iaposm going to. I have put a lot of effort in to finding youapos. It was just the right thing to do. My tickets were free because they were a present from the kids. Iaposd like to think that someone  would have done the same. Noor said she had spent £ on four £ tickets as her children liked the film and had previously enjoyed visiting the pantomime. The mum, who works in home care, said: Scarlett really loves to dance. The lady next to her moved seats and I felt bad because the tickets were so expensive. After the drink exploded I thought the people in front arenapost going to be happy. I was just thinking about the price of the tickets. Itaposs the sort of person I am, I always put other people first.

Stressing she realises people are worse off than she and motorway worker husband Alex, she says she is concerned about more bills around the corner, reports Bristol Live.Sarah, a full-time mum of two, said: Itaposs a juggling act every month. It doesnapost help when you live in an old house. Weaposre doing everything we can to keep the house warm but thereaposs only so much you can do.It concerns me, Council Tax goes up and nothing seems to get any better.We live in an older building so itaposs quite draughty. We have a thermal covering in front of the door and an oil heater in the hall.  My three-year-old and I just put our dressing gowns on or an extra jumper. I turn the heating on butI can get away with it I try not to. I close the curtains to keep the air in and when cooking I donapost open the window. Like thousands of other families across the country the Shiltonaposs are feeling the impact of rising inflation driving the cost of living squeeze.They apply for Universal Credit to help them get by but donapost get it most months because when Alex, , works overtime to make some extra cash, he is deemed to earn too much. And despite temperatures at night dipping below freezing, Sarah says she still avoids putting the heating on and instead wears extra layers.

And because weaposre at home more everything is being used more frequently.

He says he was unable to eat for days after the apparent mix-up on January . He said after taking one bite into his double cheeseburger he found it was stuffed with bacon. The fast-food fan shared his ordeal on TikTok and says he has avoided bacon his entire le for religious reasons. However, other social media users have claimed that Burger Kingaposs cheeseburgers are not halal anyway. In a video, which has been viewed more than , times, Gundogdu told the burger chain to sort their staff out as he felt that his simple instructions were not followed.Gundogdu also reveals that he was left vomiting and suffering headaches and claims it has impacted his mental and physical health.The Stansted airport employee said he was shocked he was offered two free Whopper meals as an apology, after vowing to neverto Burger King again. Burger King has since apologised for the error and said they are retraining their team to aposminimiseapos mistakes like this. Gundogdu, from Enfield, Greater London, said: I was on my lunch break and I headed to Burger King to get a double cheeseburger. I specically say with all my meals aposno baconapos, and itaposs always been correct. I told this to the till lady a couple of times, and when I got my food, I didnapost expect otherwise.  It was a simple instruction. Itaposs a mistake and weaposre all human, but it wasnapost busy so they werenapost working under pressure so there wasnapost a reason for them to have made a mistake. Itaposs just down to basic instructions. Weaposre all human, we all make mistakes, I appreciate that. When I went to eat my burger, I took a bite and it didnapost taste right. I opened the bun and it was loaded with bacon. Even the smallest bite made me feel mentally and physically sick. For three days after, I wasnapost eating properly. I was physically hungry but I couldnapost eat without vomiting. I was feeling sick. The thought of the bacon made me feel sick. Even when Iaposd be chewing anything, I was automatically thinking it was bacon. The first day, I didnapost eat. By the third day, I was slowly getting back to eating. I was starving, but I physically and mentally couldnapost eat anything.  Itaposd been my plan that I was never going to eat it in my le. I didnapost know whether I was going to have an allergic reaction. Thataposs how important it was to me. I went back to the Burger King and complained, but they werenapost very helpful. They just apologised and that was it. Nothing , which really shocked me.Gundogdu decided that further action was required, and shared his experience on Twitter and TikTok.Gundogdu said: I took it to Twitter and posted pictures on there until Burger King got back to me. They apologised and gave me a link to email them. It took days for them to get back to my email complaint, and all they did was apologise and offer me two free Whopper meals. I thought they were taking the p*ss. Burger Kingaposs response really shocked me, that it was just an apology. I told them about my mental health and how I didnapost eat for three days.  I emailed back saying aposyouaposve not taken my mental health or religion into considerationapos. Nobodyaposs done anything regarding the situation. This has % put me off going back. Iaposll never go back to Burger King again. At the time of his visit, Gundogdu admits he didnapost realise that Burger King didnapost serve halal meat - meaning the meat is not considered permissible under Islamic law - but says he is not a strict Muslim. Gundogdu said: A lot of people on my TikTok were telling me that Burger King isnapost really halal, which I didnapost really know about. I thought any meat that wasnapost pork was halal. Iaposm Muslim but Iaposm not really religious. I donapost pray, so I donapost really know a lot about it. My biggest shock came from how much bacon was on there. Even my friends were shocked. All of my friends sympathised and % of my TikTok comments were sympathetic, which surprised me. Itaposs sad because it feels like nobody is taking this seriously. Several TikTok users empathised with Gundogduaposs predicament. One wrote: Eventhe burger isnapost halal itaposs the principle. Another commented: Eating bacon is so traumatising. Youaposre not overreacting, I suffered too. Itaposs just unbearable, and the disbelief too. Other commenters werenapost as sympathetic and chastised Gundogdu for eating at Burger King in the first place. In his video, which has been viewed over , times, Gundogdu says: I was on my break, so I went to Burger King Airside to get a burger meal. So I ordered a double cheeseburger meal and I specically said aposNo baconapos twice to the cashier. Got my meal and went back to my crew-room to eat it on my break. So I bit my burger, first bite. Iaposm chewing it, but Iaposm thinking aposThis does not taste right at allapos.  for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Open the bun and find itaposs loaded with, full of bacon, yeah. And Iaposm  years old. Iaposve never ever ever eaten bacon in my entire le, and Iaposm never planning on eating bacon. Itaposs just for like religious reasons, itaposs just not in my thing and Iaposve never eaten it and never will, so that needs to be appreciated and respected, I believe, in my f**king way. So here are the pictures now. So first, I want to show you this, on the wrapper of the burger, theyaposve specically crossed this out, so no bacon. Thataposs my first proof and thataposs the first mistake that theyaposve done. Anyway...Iaposve obviously finished my chips, this is the burger that Iaposve obviously had first bite of it. And then until I realise, I find this on my burger. How  How  Can someone like explain this to me  It just doesnapost make sense. I just do not understand. But I do want to say that Iaposve not been eating anything for the past three days. Iaposve been physically sick, Iaposve been vomiting, Iaposve been having headaches. Because Iaposve never ever eaten it in my entire le, and I was never planning on eating it. This is absolutely ridiculous. So I do want to give a big shout-out to Burger King,youaposre going to watch this, because you will be tagged in this. You need your staff out, you need to let them know that they need to listen to simple instructions that they have been given by customers really. A spokesperson for SSP, who operate Burger Kingaposs Stansted airport branch, said: Weaposre committed to providing passengers with a great experience at our restaurants, and we’re sorry to have fallen short on this occasion. In light of this incident, we will be retraining our team and making sure all customised orders are double checked before they are served to help ensure it doesn’t happen again. We have been in contact with the customer to apologise directly. A spokesperson for Burger King said: Burger King UK understands the impact and upset this incident has caused Gundogdu Yuzudik and sincerely apologises for this unfortunate human error. Staff are trained to follow customer specications to ensure they can have their meal their way and we will be reinforcing our training at all restaurants, to guarantee mistakes like this are minimised.

Jane, with her two children, says the family has to wear dressing gowns and mittens to stay warm, reports the Manchester Evening News, since Malus Court, where the family resides, had its outside layer removed.The tower block was stripped of its cladding following the Grenfell disaster in  which killed  people. But as the building’s heating system is reliant on the building being insulated, the removal of cladding has left the building - and its residents - open to the freezing elements. Some residents of the Pendleton tower block say their energy prices are now so expensive they cannot afford to have their heating on more than C and rarely have lights on.Mum-of-two Jane, who moved into the property in October , works part-time and is on Universal Credit and says the energy bills regularly exceed her monthly income. As a result, her -month-old son has to spend his days in mittens and a hat, while his three-year-old sister and his mum are forced to wear dressing gowns. Jane said: “I sit at night, scared, wondering where I am going to get the money from. “I have got tin foil behind the radiators to try and keep the heat in. [The kids are] not opening the curtains to keep the heat in. “They have to sleep with hot water bottles. They are always full of cold. Then they are full of damp. “I cannot break into the kids’ money. Thataposs for nappies.”  Another mum in the tower block, Maria, who is unable to work owing to English lessons and caring for her five-year-old son, added: “The jobcentre said I should stay at home without child care because it costs so much, I canapost afford it. “I have a smart meter and I am always checking it. I have a five-year-old son. I have to do things at home. “Itaposs simple ordinary things. My son has to sleep in my bed. I cannot leave him there. This is not a le.”  Last year, she spent £, on energy, with the minimum being a £ monthly payment. At times, Maria was spending close to £ every four weeks. The building’s NIBE heating system uses vents to draw fresh air in which can then be warmed and circulated. Removing the cladding means there is less residual heat than it is designed for, causing freezing conditions for residents of the Salford City Council-owned building. Deputy Mayor John Merry said completion of works to warm the building will be done as fast as humanly possible.  He added: The reason the cladding had to be taken off the blocks was for resident safety. After Grenfell, it has been revealed there has been a national failure of building regulations and we are now legally obliged to remove and replace all cladding made from these materials. “From the perspective of the Council, we are working as hard and fast as we can with the resources we have available. Salford was one of the first Councils in the country to announce the removal and replacement of its cladded blocks – but the Government blocked our attempts to finance the speedy removal and replacement locally, and then also told us that Pendleton Together’s [PTOL] blocks were not eligible for government grant money. “After a y process of acquiring private finance on private finance markets, PTOL have removed the dangerous cladding. But structural issues have slowed work – alongside international supply-chain shortages and national labour shortages.” Pendleton Together added it was sorry to hear any examples of residents facing dficulties. A spokesperson said: Pendleton Together know that some of our residents face dficulties heating their home every winter. “Where this is due to energy prices or financial hardship we provide specialist staff who can advise on the support available and work with them to offer reassurance.“This is a service we have always provided and will continue to provide after the programme of fire safety works is complete.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Energy billsChildcareGrenfell Tower fire\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dad-of-two Dr Gary Jenkins, , sustained le-threatening injuries in an incident in Bute Park in the early hours of Tuesday, July  last year.Dr Jenkins, who was described as a loving father, husband and brother in a statement issued by his family following his death, subsequently died of a severe brain injury at the University Hospital of Wales two weeks later. Jason Edwards, , and Lee William Strickland, , both from Cardf, and a -year-old girl who cannot be named for legal reasons, are on trial at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, where they have all denied murder charges.The teen has been described as “evil and sadistic” by a witness for her part in the attack, which was thought to have been a homophobic attack on Dr Jenkins, who was reportedly bisexual, Sun Online reports Edwards, of Litchfield Court, Riverside, Strickland, of no fixed abode, and the youth have each admitted charges of manslaughter, robbery of a bag, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Prosecutor Dafydd Enoch, opening the case on Tuesday, said the killing was motivated by greed, homophobia, and a straightforward liking for violence. He told the jury: “The man at the centre of this case encountered the worst traits of humankind and despite the best efforts of one person he could not find the protection.” Mr Enoch added: “Dr Gary Jenkins was a -year-old consultant psychologist living and working in Cardf. “On July  last year in the early hours of the morning was in Bute Park in Cardf where he was viciously beaten, robbed, tortured and left for dead by these three defendants in the dock.  “It was a beating apparently motivated by greed, homophobia, and a straightforward liking of violence. All three defendants accept that they all were present when Dr Jenkins was attacked.” He said: “The chilling attack was recorded by a nearby CCTV camera and she can be heard shouting “money” at the top of her voice”. She calls Dr Jenkins ious names, Mr Enoch said, as Edwards could be heard saying: “Stamp his head, stamp his head.” Dr Jenkins could be heard in the CCTV footage pleading with the trio over and over until he could no longer speak, Mr Enoch said. Heavy blows could be heard being delivered to Mr Jenkins, before the girls was heard to say “Yeah, I needed that”. Mr Enoch rebuffed the girl’s claims that she only joined in the attack “half-heartedly” because she was scared of the two older men, saying she was “no wilting flower caught up in something that was not of her making.  “The reality is a million miles from that scenario,” he said. “For her to have acted in that way she must be a very troubled young woman. “She was loud and confident and was laughing during the attack. It was torture, pure and simple. “When witness Lewis Williams fought back to stop the attack she said: “I’m a girl” asshe was the victim. “But she is no ordinary -year-old and Mr Williams described her as “f*****g evil and sadistic”. Addressing the jury  prior to selection, Judge Daniel Williams told them about the case. He said: The defendants are charged with the murder of Gary Jenkins who died following an incident which took place on July  last year in Bute Park in the centre of Cardf.  The prosecutionaposs case is defendants were involved in robbing Gary Jenkins of a bag he was carrying and the three subjected him to a very severe assault from which he was eventually to die  days later. “The prosecutionaposs case is they assaulted a witness who tried to step in. This area of Bute Park is, the prosecution say, known for being an area where gay men have sex. The prosecution say the assault of Gary Jenkins was in some measure homophobic. The allegation of murder is denied. Mr Enoch said the teenage girl had met Edwards and Strickland for the first time on July , when the trio went to the park with the plan to rob a gay man. “They knew what went on in the park late at night and the vulnerable nature of the people who frequented that area,” he said. The group happened across Dr Jenkins, who lived alone in Cardf after separating from his we six years earlier. His we is following the evidence through a video link to the court. Dr Jenkins suffered several bleeds to the brain as a result of the attack, as well as a fractured jaw, a broken nose, swelling to the skull and multiple rib fractures. According to the prosecution, none of the defendants showed a “scintilla” of remorse after the doctor died. The case, which is expected to last four weeks and is being heard in front of Judge Daniel Williams, continues.

Despite settled conditions in coming days, Brits should be careful not to get lulled into a  sense of security with snow possible in seven days time despite bright clear skies before that. However, any cold snap is expected to be brief.James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the Express: “We are expecting to see some changes as we head into the final month of the winter.“Cold and snow will encroach from the north during the early part of February, and some of these wintry downpours may reach as far south as central England and the capital.  “The good news for snow-haters is that these blasts may only be brief as the mild weather from the Atlantic pushes across the UK. “A north-south ide will also bring the worst of the weather to Scotland and northern England with southern Britain likely to dodge the worst of the weather.” Britain is currently being straddled by a huge region of high pressure. This is keeping the snow, wind and rain at bay whilst temperatures still plummet despite the clear skies.  The high pressure will hold on through next week until it finally breaks and gives way to winter winds from the north. Models show these Artic blasts sweeping across the home nations, driven by a huge bloc of low pressure near Greenland. Mr Madden added: “This winter has so far been dominated by high pressure resulting in little in the way of cold spells and widespread snow.  “However, February certainly looks like more topsy-turvy with the weather flipping between cold and mild.” The calm, but cold weather will continue for a week apart from the odd wintry shower across Scotland or the north of England. It will see out what remains of January. Netweather forecaster Ian Simpson however said snow was even further off and that January’s high pressure would last into the early days of the next month.  He said: “High pressure is still dominating the weather, and it doesnapost look set to move very far anytime soon ‑ even at  days out, most of the forecast models still have high pressure very close to or on top of the British Isles. “The weekend looks set to be mainly dry and cloudy, with westerly winds bringing plenty of cloud and moisture into our area of high pressure. “Next week will continue with high pressure, and with high pressure mostly centred over the south of Britain, there will be some sunny spells to the east of high ground and over the south of England, but Northern Ireland, western Scotland and north-west England, will generally be cloudy.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SnowWeather\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A cold snap in January has seen frosty starts and near zero temperatures during the day but the mercury is set to briefly rise in the coming days with milder conditions. There is a north-south split, though, with brighter skies for the south and severe gales and heavy rain predicted for Scotland on Wednesday night and heading into Thursday. BBC weather forecaster Ben Rich says people in England can expect a brighter day on Wednesday but in Scotland strong gales are looming.He said: On Wednesday, England and Wales having a better chance of some sunny spells, although to the south east corner it may stay cloudy for a good part of the day.  Strengthening winds across northern areas, rain just getting into Northern Ireland, certainly settling into western and north western Scotland through the afternoon, gusts of wind in excess of mph in exposed north western parts but milder than it has been certainly across England and Wales. Through Wednesday night it will turn very, very windy across the far north, gales, even severe gales near to the northern isles. A band of cloud and increasingly patchy rain will be sinking its way southwards through the night with some fairly windy weather and relatively cloudy weather as well. Temperatures should stay above freezing in most places.”The blustery conditions are set to remain in place during Thursday in Scotland and there will also be rain for parts of England. Temperatures are expected to be around C to C at the end of the week and Mr Rich said that it could be very mild over the weekend.  But it certainly wonapost mean the end of winter as a polar blast is set for early February where the mercury could plunge as low as -C.

UK forecast for the next  daysToday: Parts of southern England perhaps still dull and chilly but perhaps some brighter spells. The rest of England and Wales brighter, breezier and slightly milder. Further north, cloud increasing, bringing rain and strong winds to north and west Scotland mild. Tonight: Rain sinking south across central UK, briefly heavy on western hills. Further north, turning more showery, but a spell of severe gales in the far north. Southern areas mostly dry. Thursday: Patchy rain and drizzle slowly clearing southern England, sunnier skies across central areas following feeling mild. Blustery showers in parts of Scotland, wintry on hills, winds and showers easing later. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Cold at first, then unsettled and often windy across the north with gales around some coasts. Rain at times, mostly across hills of the northwest.

It means that during this period one in  people in England was infected with Covid. This is the highest figure since the beginning of Imperial College Londonaposs React- study, which has been running since May . It is also more than three times higher than the prevalence in the previous round of the study, which looked at November  to December . Overall, the data suggests the peak of the wave was around January , with cases flattening off by the middle of the month.  The data also indicates that, while prevalence was decreasing among adults in January, it was rising in children. Meanwhile, of the , people who said whether or not they have previously had Covid, two thirdsreported a past infection. Researchers urged caution, however, saying it is unknown when those past infection were and that PCR tests canpositive results for more than  days after diagnosis.  The increase in prevalence corresponds with Omicron becoming the dominant iant in England, the researchers added. Over the study period, prevalence increased in every region compared to the previous report, with the highest figure recorded in the North East at .%, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber at .%. Professor Paul Elliott, director of the React programme from Imperialaposs School of Public Health, said: There is good news in our data in that infections had been rapidly dropping during January, but they are still extremely high and may have recently stalled at a very high prevalence. Of particular concern is that there is rapidly increasing prevalence among children now they are mixing more following the start of the school term and, compared with December, prevalence in older people aged -plus has increased seven- to -fold, which may lead to increased hospitalisations. Itaposs therefore vital that we continue to monitor the situation closely to understand the impact of the Omicron iant, which now makes up almost all infections in the country.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: Itaposs reassuring to see Covid- infections beginning to slow across the country as we move back to Plan A.Covid- rates are still high so, as we learn to live with the virus, it is vital we continue to be vigilant - wash your hands, let in fresh air, get tested and,you havenapost already, get boosted now.

Yorkshire Live reports that a signicant number of dogs have tested positive for the virus after experiencing gastroenteritis-like symptoms. It comes after reports of dogs are being struck down with a mystery illness leaving them lethargic and thin - with walkers saying pathways are covered in diarrhoea. Parvovirus hit Britain in the s and a leading Yorkshire vet has told owners what to dotheir pet falls unwell. Director at Donaldsonaposs Vets, Martin Paterson, who became famous appearing on Channel aposs The Yorkshire Vet, said: We have been testing the majority of these cases for parvovirus and we have turned up a number of dogs who have tested positive. A lot of them are very ill and need quite a lot of intensive, inpatient management to be able to turn them around. But he stressed dogs testing positive for the virus are not showing the very, very acute signs that made the virus so deadly in the late s to s. He added: It is dficult to be sure whether it is just a case of us testing more dogs for parvovirus, and that is reflecting what is going on more widely, or whether there is a unique issue in this area. We are seeing dogs that have been to the seaside - where a lot of these reports are coming from - but we are also seeing a lot of dogs with gastroenteritis who have stayed locally.  We have not been able to find any pattern to connect these dogs. They are of all ages, all breeds and all geographical areas across the branches of our practice. The infections do seem to happen quite randomly. According to Mr Paterson, symptoms of gastroenteritis among dogs include vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and an unwillingness to exercise. He urged owners who notice such symptoms to seek medical attention immediately. Come and see us, he said. We will often ask you to leave your dog in the car and we will examine them outside in the car park - just so that weaposre not risking bringing anything into the hospital or the clinic.There is a relatively quick test that we can do on faeces to check for parvovirus. This is not coronavirus - there is no evidence that it is connected to Covid in any way.Booster vaccinations for dogs need to be done every  months - soyour dog hasnapost had their booster in that time, they are potentially susceptible to parvovirus. He continued: Parvovirus is very resistant and can survive in an environment for a long time. If you go out for a walk with your dog, keep them away from obvious piles of dog faeces.  But, a dog could shed parvovirus on the path that youaposre walking on, and it can remain there for six months, so it is dficult to make sure that your dog doesnapost come into contact with it. The only effective way of preventing it is booster vaccination. Last week, Jenner Grfin said her -month-old puppy fell violently ill a matter of hours after finishing a walk at the same park in Leeds.  She told Leeds Live : He’s shaking, has a temperature, he’s vomiting loads, lethargic, not eating anything.Just days earlier Nicola Jane said her dog, a six-month-old Lurcher, became extremely poorly just a few hours after a walk by a canal and she thought her pup might die. She added: He is a mess, he is like a skeleton he is that skinny. He lost that much weight. There was nothing on him, no le, he was limp, I thought he was gone, I thought I was losing him.

The Prime Minister has already ended work-from-home guidance and further restrictions are expiring under new Plan A rulesPlan B guidance is coming to an end as the UK moves to living with Covid Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments Rules for working from home have changed once again as the UK looks ahead to le with the coronavirus.Boris Johnsonaposs government scrapped the work-from-home guidance last week, ahead of the planned expiration of Plan B measures on January .It means that from tomorrow, restrictions like mask-wearing in indoor public places and NHS Covid Passes in certain venues will no longer be mandatory. The government hopes that the UK is now past the peak of the Omicron iant, although some experts believe the end of measures to be something of a risk.Plenty of people are looking forward to ing to the officethey havenapost done so already.According to a new research report by building management firm Infogrid, one in three Brits want toto the office this month, citing mental health as a reason for doing so.Others, meanwhile, will be wary of ing to work as they try to protect themselves from the virus, as well as loved ones. Productivity is another reason given why some employers are keen for people toto work. So can your employer force you to go into the office   Do we still have to work from home   Work-from-home guidance ended with immediate effect, the Prime Minister announced in a statement to the House of Commons on January . This means that people are now able to go back into the office when previously they were discouraged from doing so since Plan B was put in place on December .  The PM said: From now on, the government are no longer asking people to work from home. People should now speak to their employer about arrangements for ing to the office.Leader of the Labour PartyKeir Starmer said in response that the opposition approved the plans as long as they were based on evidence.He said the PM must reassure the public he is acting to protect their health, not just his job. Can your company force you to go back to the office   If your company requires you to come into the office, they can only make youyour contract stipulates working in an office. Citizens Advice said: You can ask to keep working from home, but that doesnapost mean your employer has to agree. Start by having an open conversation with your employer about your wishes, and consider making a flexible working request.However, employers are also duty-bound to make the work environment as safe as possible, so they should consider minimising visitors and improving ventilation, as well as considering the use of one-way systems and extra cleaning. The Trade Union Commission, meanwhile, had firmer advice people may want to considerthey do not feel safe at work.It said: If your boss is asking you toto the workplace or stay at home and you don’t feel comfortable, you should speak to other members and your union rep immediately - they may feel the same about the situation. If you raise the issue collectively with your employer, they’re much more likely to listen. What is Plan A and whataposs changed since Plan B   All Plan B restrictions were originally due to expire on January  but will be in place for one extra day, lting on Thursday January . As well as the work-from-home guidance, face coverings are no longer required in school classrooms from January . An unnamed director of public health at a city in the north of England said they have some concerns about the change of rules in classrooms.They told: This feels like more of a political decision than a decision based on the evidence and the science, and it could be quite London-centric.I worry the decision has not been made for the right reasons.From January , face coverings in indoor public places will no longer be required and venues and events will no longer be required by law to use NHS Covid passes.Venues can choose to impose the use of passesthey choose to do so.

The unidentied woman, , was told she had cervical cancer three and a half years after doctors failed to find abnormalities on her smear test. The woman, from Liverpool, cannot conceive after undergoing treatment to have cancerous tissues and part of her cervix removed, LiverpoolECHO reports. She has now received an interim payment from Liverpool University HospitalsNHS Foundation Trust through her solicitors Irwin Mitchell.Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust admitted a breach of duty on behalf of the former Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, which at the time was responsible for analysing the womanaposs test result.  The hospital trust admitted thather smear test result had been accurately reported then she would have had more tests and the right treatment by October . On the balance of probabilities, treatment would have meant she would not have developed cancer, the Trust added. The woman has since shared her story to try and help others. She said: “When I was told my first smear was clear I didn’t think anything more and put my faith in what I was told. “When suspicions were raised on my second test I started to worry. Over the next few weeks, it was dficult to not fear the worst but nothing still prepares you for the news you have cancer.  “It was such an emotional time following my diagnosis. I was trying to contend with my diagnosis and treatment while also trying to think about what it may mean for the future. “My treatment was hard both mentally and physically. I was almost relying on my partner and family for everything. “Family is so important for me and my partner. I’ve always wanted to have at least two, maybe three children and to be told my chances of being able to conceive would be much reduced was particularly hard to accept. In August , the woman received her first smear test result, which was incorrectly classed as negative. She was then told she didnapost have to attend an appointment until she was routinely recalled. It was later discovered that her test result should have highlighted suspect cell changes. When she had a follow up routine smear test in March , the results showed severe cell changes. After going for further tests she was diagnosed with cervical cancer the following month. The woman, who is now cancer-free but has been left unable to conceive, is now using the funds that she got to undergo surrogacy in the US. She said: “We’ve spent hour upon hour researching and looking into ious options for starting a family. Starting the surrogacy process has been a major boost for us and has given us something to focus on. Although we’re optimistic things are starting to go in the right direction we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves. “I just hope that by speaking out I can help others and lessons are learned from what happened to me. While my original smear test was incorrectly reported the second one probably helped save my le. “It’s vital that women don’t feel embarrassed and make sure they attend appointments. It’s also important that women diagnosed with cervical cancer don’t feel that they have to suffer alone. Help and support is available.” Sharon Williams, the specialist medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing the woman, said: “Our client’s case is sadly another reminder of the consequences women can be left to face through the incorrect recording of smear tests. The last few years and coming to terms with her diagnosis and what it means for her long term has been incredibly upsetting for her. “While we can’t make up for what’s happened we’re pleased that we’ve been able to establish the answers that she and her partner deserved. “She hopes that by sharing her story she can improve patient safety for other women and also highlight the importance of taking part in the cervical cancer screening programme. “We’re continuing to support our client as she now attempts to look to the future and hopefully realise her dream of having the family she has always wanted.” The Mirror understands that following changes to the way the service is commissioned, Liverpool University Hospitals stopped providing cervical screening services in . A spokesperson for Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: “We sincerely apologise for the failings in the reporting of the patient’s cervical screening. We fell below the highest standards of care we strive to achieve for our patients and the commitment to keep our patients safe. All processes were reviewed at the time to ensure lessons were learnt.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationHospitalsCervical cancerStarting a familyCancerSurrogacy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite Covid rates increasing thanks to the Omicron iant, the hospital admission rate has decreased. Even so, itaposs important to do all we can to avoid spreading Covid. Itaposs well known that certain places and activities can increase our risk, but a new study has offered clear estimates about the risk of Covid infection. So which activities are safe, and how safe exactly are they  Researchers have published a study in the peer-reviewed Environmental Science  Technology journal calculated the exact risk of catching Covid in ious environments. Where youaposre most likely to catch Covid  Displayed in a handy chart, the study has lists the percentage likelihood of becoming infected in dferent situations. For example,youaposre sitting in a crowded cinema with a mostly unmasked audience, thereaposs a % chance of being infected, assuming everyone in the room is silent. However,there are some people talking, the odds of infection jump to %. If the audience is masked, the risk of infection drops to a mere .%they stay silent, or %there is talking.

Brits will be well aware of the three main symptoms of coronavirus – a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell.

The things that increase your risk are:Gathering together with lots of people in an enclosed space with poor air quality, such as an under-ventilated gym, nightclub or school classroom Doing something strenuous or rowdy such as exercising, singing or shouting Leaving off your masks Staying there for a long timeTo avoid catching Covid, the study recommends keeping in the green or amber spaces of the table.  That means: If you must meet other people, do so outdoors or in a space that’s well-ventilated or meet in a space where the ventilation is good and air quality is known.Keep the number of people to a minimum Spend the minimum possible amount of time together Don’t shout, sing or do heavy exercise Wear high-quality, well-fitting masks from the time you enter the building to the time you leaveThe study stresses that while the chart gives an estimated figure for each situation, the actual risk will depend on the specic parameters, such as exactly how many people are in a room of what size.

And one of the first big-money commercial deals they signed in September  was with streaming giant Netflix, which is reportedly worth around £million.However, almost  months on from the big announcement, Netflix has yet to release any content produced by the couple. It mirrors a similar deal theyaposve signed with Spoty for £million to produce podcasts for the  - but apart from a trailer and one  minute episode, there has been no other output.Yesterday, it was reported that Spoty was taking the deal into its own hands by hiring a number of in-house producers to help deliver on the deal after waiting more than a year for any material. So could it be that Netflix will do the same  Here we take a look... aposPowerful storytellingapos Harry and Meghanaposs deal with Netflix was formally announced on September , , in one of their first business ventures away from the Royal Family.Itaposs never been confirmed exactly how much the deal is worth - but reports put it at around million. In a statement at the time, the pair said: Our lives, both independent of each other and as a couple, have allowed us to understand the power of the human spirit, of courage, resilience and the need for connection.  Through our work with erse communities and their environments, to shining a light on people and causes around the world, our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives hope. As new parents, making inspirational family programming is also important to us, as is powerful storytelling through a truthful and relatable lens. Meanwhile, Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, said: Harry and Meghan have inspired millions of people all around the world with their authenticity, optimism and leadership. We’re incredibly proud they have chosen Netflix as their creative home – and are excited about telling stories with them that can help build resilience and increase understanding for audiences everywhere. Speaking in a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, Harry said deals with the streaming giants were never part of the plan, but said they needed cash to pay for security. He said: That was suggested by somebody  by the point of where my family literally cut me off financially, and I had to afford security for us. Upcoming shows  Although no programmes have made it to screens, details of several shows Harry and Meghan have been working on have been released.In April , it was revealed a documentary called Heart of Invictus was in the works - with Harry saying he couldnapost be more excited for it. The series will focus on injured or ill service members around the globe preparing for the  Invictus Games at The Hague, The Netherlands. The episodes will chart the journey of the competitors as they train up, the organisers as they set to work making the planned games a reality, and also the national teams working with both sides for the delayed games in the Spring.Meanwhile, last July, it was announced Meghan would be acting as an executive producer on an animated series about a young girlaposs adventures.It has the working title Pearl and the young character will be inspired by a iety of influential women from throughout history. Other executive producers include Elton Johnaposs husband David Furnish, Carolyn Soper, and Emmy Award-winning filmmakers Liz Garbus and Dan Cogan. No air date has been given for the show. Fly-on-the-wall documentary   When Harry and Meghanaposs Netflix deal was announced, it was speculated that the pair could feature in their own fly-on-the-wall-style documentary.However, this was swtly denied by the Sussexes, with their spokesperson telling Hello:The Duke and Duchess are not taking part in any reality shows. But last September, it was reported that Harry was spotted with a mic during his and Meghanaposs tour of New York.The black wire could be seen sticking out his trouser pocket and into his shirt and it has been suggested the couple may have been recording content for their Netflix deal. Hiring help Now it appears that Netflix is on the look out for a Los Angeles-based production designer to work on the Pearl project.According to MailOnline, the job ad posted on social media states the person will help to develop, create and support the aesthetic vision of the executive producer team.The job ad also states: The ideal candidate will need to be someone who can collaborate with grace, humility, inclusion and open-mindedness.

Sheaposs now spoken out saying how upsetting le can be, as people judge her for not dressing like a child or for wearing make up, and they even approach her mother and criticise her parenting. What do you think of Shaunaaposs bravey  Let us know in the comments...Shauna is starring in a TLC documentary called I Am Shauna Rae, and in the showaposs advert, she said: If you were to look at me, you would think Iaposm just a normal little girl, doing normal little girl things with my fun, crazy family. But the truth is Iaposm not a little girl. Iaposm a woman, a -year-old woman stuck in the body of an eight-year-old.The channel also shared a clip from the show on TikTok, @tlctv, which includes an interview with Shauna and her mum, Patty Schrankel.  Patty said: Shauna likes to dress up, like any other -year-old, but we go out together and she gets looks like aposoh wow, what is she doing  What is that kid doing apos Then I get the looks of aposhow could you  How could you let your child dress like this  And the negative comments have an impact on Shauna, even though theyaposre not directed at her. Shauna said: My mum has to explain that Iaposm old enough to make my own decisions, but they donapost believe her - they call her a liar. So thataposs not fun. I feel horrible for my mum because I donapost deal with all the backlash, they donapost think itaposs appropriate to come up to a child and say these things - they think itaposs appropriate to come up to the mother which isnapost appropriate at all, in my opinion. And I know it affects her.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. After the clip was shared on TikTok, many people commented their support of Shauna - saying she was brave to speak out. One said: This ladyaposs situation is heartbreaking. Sheaposs a -year-old woman wanting all the things a -year-old wants and needs to do. Then another wrote: She is very mature. Talk to her and itaposs quite obvious she is not a child. And a third commented: Can we talk about how beautul that girl is  Look at her eyes!Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Vegan option at a wedding, she wrote in the tweet, alongside an eye-rolling emoji, which spoke a thousand words. The post was then shared to Reddit, where people were less than complimentary about the offering. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The caterer forgot to bring their vegan option, but luckily found some weeds on the ground, one wrote, while another added: This is literally so rude to your guest. I’d be so p*****. A third said: F***ers didnapost even try, while a fourth gently suggested: Please be considerate about people’s choices at your wedding... I had visceral reaction to this, another joked. The person who made this has clearly been victim to aposwhat do vegans even eat, leaves apos panic. Meanwhile, one Reddit user tried to come up with a logical solution as to why the vegan option would be so poor, suggesting thereaposs a good chance the caterers were only prepped for the non-vegan meals ahead of dinner time. Sometimes in catering you may be hired to prepare certain foods and you may have bought all ingredients already when someone asks you to prepare a vegan option, they wrote. I’ve been in that situation and what can you do really  Most of the time you can only really prepare the meal you have ingredients for minus the meat.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Whether proven to be guilty or not, the online blacklist denounces those included as pro-Russian collaborators - with some then winding up dead.It comes as elite Russian paratroopers were seen being moved close to the Ukrainian border amid fears of a military operation to occupy the nationaposs capital Kiev.A train with the Russian crack troops and their equipment was spotted moving west through the Bryansk region, which borders both Ukraine and Belarus, towards the potential war zone. Nearly , military personnel have already been dispatched by the Kremlin to the north and east of their former Soviet allies.  And with the threat of war rising, nothing can exempt the quickly growing number of iniduals accused by Myrotvorets from being listed. Crimes listed range from acts of propaganda or war to those who offended political or popular sensitivity or used the wrong vernacular. But it doesnapost matter, all names - which total around , - are posted side by side with their personal data published alongside the supposed wrongdoing committed. One of the latest entries is Ukraine’s deputy chief prosecutor, Oleksiy Symonenko, accused of pushing through a fabricated charge in the case against ex-President Petro Poroshenko.  Others include war criminals and agents of Russiaaposs intelligence service FSB, as well as Pink Floydaposs Roger Waters who claimed Russia had more rights to Crimea than Ukraine. Nobel-prize winning Belarussian writer and critic Svetlana Alexievich was listed accused of inciting inter-ethnic ision after suggesting some ethnic Ukrainians helped Nazis kill Jews during the Second World War. Five hundred Ukrainian-Hungarian public servants are also named and shamed as Ukraine forbids double citizenship, with the site branding them “separatists” and “traitors”.  The website was launched in  following a meeting between Ukrainian politician George Tuka and an ex-member of the state intelligence service, SBU - known by the alias aposRoman Zaitsevapos. Tuka denies the site has any state funding or that it is controlled by the Ukraine security service SBU, instead claiming it aims to independently clean up the country of any pro-Russian sentiment or activity.The problem we had back in  is the same we have now: ex-police, ex-military and some political figures, whose beliefs remain pro-Russian, Tuka told the Times.  Some moved geographically to eastern Ukraine and Russia. Some live among us. There was no consolidated official database holding their names. Myrotvorets was set up to fill that gap. He went on to say the siteaposs mission has changed in recent years with more and more names added, particularly those who protect the narrative of Russia. He added it was unfortunate no Ukrainian law prohibits pro-Russian parties or narratives. But having your name on the list could lead to more than just exposure with several murders occurring within days of victims appearing on Myrotvorets. Ukrainian politician Yevheniy Murayev, who was at the weekend accused by British security agencies of being groomed by the Kremlin to potentially lead a post-invasion administration in Kiev, has been listed and said there is some fear. He said: People listed on Myrotvorets can end up dead. There is a threat, a risk that involves falling out of a window or having to flee the country. I am aware of that threat, but I live with the risk. Two pro-Russian figures, publicist Oles Buzina and legislator Oleg Kalashnikov were shot dead in Kiev in April  shortly after their personal information was published. Tuka denies there was any link with the site.

The close ally of Vladimir Putin told senators that Russia should examine imposing chemical castration routinely for men convicted of child sex offences, a punishment used in neighbouring Kazakhstan. Her deputy Andrei Turchak intervened and said: “Iaposd suggest physical [castration].” Matviyenko, , said Russia should further toughen its laws and called for looking at castration as a punishment and “study the experience of other states”. But the priority was to jail child sex attackers, she said. Turchak won applause from senators when he said le sentences should be imposed on first-time paedophile offenders. The new laws which apply to cases when the victims are under  follow a spate of cases which have received big publicity in the Russian media. An attack this month saw “a convicted paedophile and his male lover” snatch a girl, five from a snowy street.  The child was subsequently raped and then killed, say reports citing law enforcement. She had been stabbed multiple times and her body hidden in a duffle bag. When the suspects were later detained, they needed police protection to stop a lynching by furious locals. The child, Veronika Nikolayeva, had been playing near the cinema and cultural complex where her mother works in Kostroma. One of the suspects was named as Denis Gerasimov, , earlier jailed for paedophile offences including producing child pornography. He was released from jail in March last year, after serving four-and-a-half years for convictions which included sex with an underage girl.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Moscow’s elite forces have advanced across the border ahead of the main force of combat troops.The Mirror has learned Russia’s GRU military intelligence unit and Spetsnaz crack troops are believed already to be in Ukraine preparing for war. They are seen as an advance party appearing to plot an attack by , regular forces gathered at Ukraine’s eastern flank as well as thousands more in Belarus. It came as British special forces are preparing for a mass evacuation of more than , British nationalsthey become stranded.  They are being told to register with the skeleton embassy left in Kyiv, from where they will be air-evacuated or bussed by road  miles east to Poland.Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned British troops could soon be sent to eastern Europe to help bolster NATO against Russia.Mr Wallace told the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee there were iniduals already in Ukraine “linked to the Russian state in ways that are not conventional” and “that should give cause for concern”. He added: “We are becoming aware of a signicant number of iniduals that are assessed to be associated with Russian military advance force operations that currently are located in Ukraine. “And that is what we expect to see next and what we’re seeing now.”  Ukraine’s SBU intelligence and security agency is working round the clock to seize Russian spooks trying to pinpoint the country’s defences. Several have been arrested in the contested Donbas area in recent months and Ukraine forces have massively locked down security. Russian covert operatives in Ukraine will be preparing espionage, sabotage operations and anything to undermine Ukraine’s defences. Britain has given thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles to Kyiv’s forces to help them hold back a Russian armoured attack, along with  UK military trainers.  Mr Wallace added: “Any crossing into Ukraine, whether small or large, would be viewed as a breach of that sovereignty, against international law and an invasion. “You can’t be half-pregnant, you are either invading a country or you are not.” On Tuesday Mr Johnson warned the UK may deploy troops to protect Nato allies in Europe should Russia invade, saying Vladimir Putin faces “ferocious” Ukrainian resistance. The PM said the UK and its allies stand ready to impose “heavy economic sanctions” on Russia, amid fears of “bloodshed comparable to the first war in Chechnya or Bosnia”.  Mr Johnson told the House of Commons: “If Russia pursues this path, many Russian mothers’ sons will not be coming home. “The response in the international community would be the same and the pain that would be inflicted on the Russian economy will be the same.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party “stands resolute” in supporting Ukraine.Mr Johnson added: “The British Army leads the Nato battle group in Estonia andRussia invades Ukraine, we would look to contribute to any new Nato deployments to protect our allies in Europe.”  He went on: “There is nothing new about large and powerful nations using the threat of brute force to terry reasonable people into giving way to otherwise completely unacceptable demands. “ButPresident Putin was to choose the path of bloodshed and destruction, he must realise that it’d be both tragic and futile, and nor should we allow him to believe that he could easily take some smaller portion of Ukraine - to salami-slice - because the resistance would be ferocious.” The SAS-led UK evacuation mission is already in Ukraine preparing for an emergency evacuation, along with the Special Forces Support Group. Foreign Office advice was posted stating: ”British nationals in Ukraine are requested to register their presence in Ukraine. This will allow us to provide the latest information but it is still advised that British nationals continue to read and follow FCDO Travel Advice.” The request for UK nationals to register their details is a ’standard operating procedure’ by the FCDO when they planning an evacuation such as in the Lebanon, Sierra Leone and more recently Kabul. A senior source said: “It could be a simple operationwe can get people to the airport and fly out, butMoscow imposes an air embargo it will be a nightmare. “We know the Germans and other countries are also planning to airlt their people and we are looking at using a road route to the Polish border, but will be the FCDO’s call.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Foreign OfficeNatoBritish ArmyBoris JohnsonBen WallaceVladimir PutinArmed forcesSpecial forcesPoliticsDaily MirrorUkraine crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chandra Morton, , from Johnson City, Tennessee, claims she is lucky to still have her top lip after filler was accidentally injected into an artery in her face. The US waitress says her face changed colour and white blisters began to appear due to vascular occlusion - which happens when circulation of oxygen is blocked from the area. She claims she has lost a small chunk of her top lip but says she is grateful the doctor eventually manage to fix the issue before she lost more of her lip to necrosis. Chandra added: I wanted to get lip fillers because I had always felt insecure about my top lip. So many people have had their lips done and I thought it would be fine. I was looking forward to having fuller lips. However as soon as I had the procedure done, my lips felt so numb and started turning white. Eventually the colour of my face changed and more and more white blisters kept appearing. I was absolutely terried and I was in so much pain. I was told thatI waited a day longer I would have lost my entire top lip to necrosis. I lost a small part of my top lip and I have some scarring around my mouth, but eventually the doctor managed to reverse the damage using hyaluronic acid. I just want to raise awareness of the risks that come with these procedures. In March , Chandra saved up for a month to have the £ procedure done.  She claims she had .ml injected into her top lip and couldnapost wait to see the results. Chandra, who has decided not to name the doctor, said: Although I am scared of needles, I was so excited to have it done. The procedure was super quick and over within  minutes but it was so painful I almost passed out. On the way home my lips were still so numb and I noticed them going white. I wasnapost surethis was normal but I tried not to think too much of it. Later on my face became so painful and stung. I kept checking the mirror and more white spots were appearing. I was panicking so I emailed them during the evening but as it was a Saturday I didnapost hear back. I cried the whole way through the night. The next morning my face was even whiter and I was freaking out. It kept getting worse.  On Monday I eventually managed to have a call with the doctor and he video called me to see how my face looked. As soon as he saw me he started freaking out and said that in  years of doing filler, he had never seen anything like this. Chandra claims the phone call worried her as the doctor revealed she would probably need to have it dissolved. She says that she called other clinics for a second opinion, and after emailing over pictures she was told to get seen immediately. Chandra added: A doctor from a dferent clinic told me that I had vascular occlusion and that I could have necrosis setting in. I went back to the doctor who done my filler and he injected four shots of hyaluronic acid to try and fix the issue. It was so painful and I was screaming while it was happening. I went back home thinking that it seemed better but more blisters were appearing and my face was still going whiter.  The next day I had to go back again for nine more shots of hyaluronic acid in my face. My whole face was so swollen and I hadnapost eaten for almost a week because of the amount of pain my mouth had been in. The doctor had finally corrected his mistakes and after also going to trauma care, I was told I luckily didnapost need to use a hyperbaric tank and I was given some numbing cream and medication to help with scarring. A little chunk of my lip did fall off and I still have some scarring around my lips but it is a reminder to never put anything in my face again. The doctor kept in touch with me for two months to make sure everything was okay. He took care of me afterwards and tried to make things right. Iaposm not trying to scare people, I just want to raise awareness of the risks that come with getting filler injected into your face. I will never do anything like this again. The doctor - who has not been named on the request of Chandra - has been contacted for a right of reply.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cosmetic surgeryBeauty trendsHealth\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" for the Real Beauty newsletter and join our community of real people who test products in the real world - all for free!Sign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We have never tried to overfeed Liznya.  Some people wrote we do it on purpose. How do you imagine that  She even refuses to eat any other food than her diet food. It is true that our cat was pregnant and spayed after it, but we do not claim this is the exact reason for her to become obese. We wrote that she began to gain weight quickly since her pregnancy and even quicker after it. In an Instagram reel on Liznyaaposs page, her owners showed themselves measuring out g of Royal Canin diet food for her. In their post to answer questions about her diet, they explained that Liznya had been to the vets multiple times and that this was her current recommended diet.  But they also hit back at trolls who have wished death upon the owners and dispelled suggestions the rotund feline is unable to walk because of her weight problems. The post continued: She has been to the vet many times and has changed her diet plan more than once during this time. Now she seems to have stopped gaining weight with her current plan, but still there are problems with losing it.  We can’t show her to a vet too frequently, but we will definitely do it again and againneeded. We do not support any kinds of abuse and it is not OK to threaten the owners. And we also can’t ignore that some point out that our cat was slimmer in .  It is true, but she did not gain much weight since then, look at other old pictures taken from a dferent angle to make sure. And yes, Liznya can walk, she even loves to play hunting! We agree she needs to be more active to lose her weight. If some people still do not believe the above, well, that is your opinion, but please do not spread  information and do not wish the owners to die. It is a bit sad to read messages like this.  The fattest domestic cat to have lived on record was an Australian Tabby which weighed kg . In , an kg rescue kitty dubbed aposthe real-le Garfieldapos made global headlines when pictures emerged of his enormous figure. The lb cat, whose real name was Bronson, was quickly given a diet overhaul by his new owners Mike Wilson and Meghan Hanneman.

arrive back in Scotland. Currently, the international \" fully vaccinated\" definition includes two doses of the Covid vaccine and not the booster dose. However, this is being kept under review. Ms

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

At that time, the local authority said the land was allocated for “circa  homes”.However, Persimmon Homes has gone beyond that figure and is looking to create a residential development of “circa  units”.Twenty-five per cent of the properties, which would include terraced, semi-detached and detached homes, would be classed as affordable.Access to the new homes would come from two new junctions created on Lammermoor Terrace, while a SUDSwould be created in the east of the site.Various studies will make up part of any application to the council.If the scheme is eventually approved, the developer will have to agree a sum for contributions to a range of projects, including extending both Windygoul Primary School and Ross High School.A sum would also be agreed “towards the enhancement of community sports facilities at Polson Park”.Money would also go towards covering the impact on a number of junctions, including Bankton Junction onto the A.Representatives from Persimmon Homes East Scotland were available to answer any questions about the scheme last Thursday afternoon.A spokesperson for the company revealed that nearly  people attended the online event.They said: “We hope local residents found it helpful:  attended and  questions were asked.“The most frequently raised concerns were general disruption during construction and extra local traffic on Birsley Road and Lammermoor Terrace.“Anyone who was unable to join the consultation can find out more about the proposed development by going to persimmonhomes lammermoor-terrace and sites.google view lam mermoor-terrace“Those wishing to comment can still do so by submitting an email or via post before January .“We will be reviewing all comments and how they can be addressed within the next stage of our planning application to East Lothian Council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-railway-station-office-opening-hours-slashed","story":"Opening hours of the office at the station, which links the county with the north of England as well as Edinburgh, could be reduced by nearly  hours per week.The idea is being weighed up by ScotRail, which operates more than , train services through  stations throughout Scotland.Fewer than  stations have staffed ticket offices, with Dunbar making up part of that number.The move has been criticised by rail union RMT and the county’s MP Kenny MacAskill and MSP Paul McLennan.RMT is “wholly opposed” to cuts to ticket offices and believes that these will deter passengers from the rail network and make it less accessible for disabled and elderly passengers.They claim that cuts to ticket office hours worsen passenger service, safety and security by reducing the times that staff are guaranteed to be present at stations and make it far easier for operators to reduce overall staffing levels in the future.Mick Lynch, general secretary, said: “Cuts to ticket office hours will do nothing to restore passenger confidence in Scotland’s sustainable rail network, which has a central role to play in delivering modal sht away from high-carbon transport.“These proposals affect nearly all of the ticket offices in Scotland and will undoubtedly worsen passenger service and accessibility, as well as turning many of our stations into a mugger’s paradise.”Mr MacAskill backed the RMT in opposing the reduction in hours.Currently, the booking office – the only one of its kind in East Lothian – is open from .am to .pm from Monday to Friday.The proposed changes would see the office open at .am and shut at .pm with the exception of Friday, when it would close  minutes earlier.Changes would also be introduced on a Saturday and Sunday.The booking office opens at .am on a Saturday and shuts at .pm, with opening hours of .am to .pm on a Sunday.

In fact, the benefits of plants and green spaces are now so well documented that medical professionals are beginning to see gardening as an important means of helping improve the wellbeing of some patients.Although not everyone is fortunate enough to have a garden, most will have space for an indoor plant and the value of those shouldn’t be overlooked. They remove the invisible air-borne pollutants that exist in all homes coming from everyday household cleaning products, decorating materials, upholstery and furniture.This, together with a plant’s natural ability to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, means that they are continuously improving the quality of the air that we breathe.In addition to these direct physical and mental benefits, home-grown vegetables are undoubtedly one of the best ways to source fresh, healthy food and reduce food miles. Just imagine the satisfaction of growing your own herbs and veg, and collecting on the very day you plan to use them in your meal – it just doesn’t get any fresher than that!If you’d like to try growing your own fresh, healthy meals, here’s a few ideas about how you might start:l Potatoes should be grown from certied seed potatoes which have been tested, are disease-free and true to iety. Seed potatoes are available now in reputable garden centres and you can start them off indoors, encouraging them to sproutso they have a start when you plant them out. Potatoes will generally be planted out in March April, with First Earlies harvesting as early as June July. Second Earlies can be harvested in August September, while Maincrop potatoes can be harvested into October. The early potatoes are those wonderfully tasty ‘new potatoes’ but don’t store as well as the maincrop ieties are able to be harvested and kept for use throughout the winter.l Brassica vegetables such as cabbage, caullower, sprouts and broccoli can be grown from seed starting in the next few weeks or purchased as seedlings in the garden centre in springtime when it’s time to plant them out.l Root vegetables such as carrots or parsnips can be dficult to transplant and prefer to be grown from seed sown directly into the place where they’ll grow.l Salad vegetables are mostly very easy to grow from seed and can be started indoors in the next few weeks until it’s warm enough to let them grow outdoors. It’s also an economical way to feed the family – for the price of a lettuce in the supermarket, you could buy a pack of seeds that could grow several hundred lettuce! Many salad vegetables only take a few weeks from sowing to harvesting, so we suggest that you sow a few little and often and you’ll have a continuous crop for many months of the year. Extend the season by starting or finishing the crop indoors when the weather is too cold for growing outdoor.l Microgreens, miniature vegetables that make an attractive and tasty garnish, take only days to grow from seed and are an easy kitchen window-sill crop. As with the salad vegetables, sow little and often to have a continuous crop.Hopefully this gives you some suggestions to help you with your plans for a healthier lestyle and even helps your budget!If you need more help and advice, our plant team are always delighted to help and you will find lots more information on the seed packets and online at merryhattonHappy gardening for !"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gastropub-named-best-uk","story":"The Bonnie Badger in Gullane, East Lothian placed in the - category, being awarded position number .The Estrella Damm Top  Gastropub Awards is created each year by an academy of several hundred judges spread throughout the UK who vote for who they think are the must-see gastropubs.The academy is made up of food industry experts, chefs, operators, food writers and journalists, all of whom keep a close eye on the market and the trends within.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CYUfxDIBS  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CYUfxDIBS  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

Though this new model reverts back to a fabric roof, it remains impressively refined.. Audi TT RoadsterAudi is renowned for its quattro all-wheel-drive system and its available on the vast majority of its models – even including its TT sports car. Helping to offer superb traction, it doesnt detract from the TTs brilliant driving experience. Though the standard bhp  TFSI should offer plenty of power for most, those seeking extra performance can look out for the S and RS models.Its fast-closing roof will come in very useful should you find yourself in a winter shower, while the TTs superb, upmarket and tech-laden interior is an absolute joy to spend time in..

The Range Rover Evoque Convertible was the first, and while no longer on sale, Volkswagen has aimed to fill the niche with its new T-Roc Cabriolet.Bringing chunkier styling than your typical drop-top, this T-Roc isnt really all about performance, but rather ease of use. It gets a generous amount of equipment as standard, while is far roomier than a typical convertible, with a usable boot and decent amount of space in the rear seats.

From airport pick up to drop off, groups can play the world’s finest and most famous links, parkland and heathland golf courses.“All golfers are keen to play the Old Course, and we can arrange that,” says Derek Anderson. “But many, particularly ing groups, want to play one of the lesser-known courses and that can only come with knowledge of superb courses that might not appear in basic searches.“We have more than  courses in Scotland and many groups will want to play several while theyre here. Thats where we can step in. We can plan those routes, and make sure that when it comes to courses, we don’t miss those hidden gems.”With such a passion for everything that Scotland has to offer, GHW Golf Tours can offer experiences that take in the very best of everything we have to offer. In fact, even non-golfers will find so much to inspire and entertain them.“The knowledge and contacts I gained during the first few years in the industry were invaluable when GHW Golf Tours was established in ,” says Derek Anderson.“It was clear that we could offer a much more rounded experience than just providing the best possible golfing experience. This is Scotland. Look at everything we have to offer. I knew that we could create bespoke packages for every group, no matter their budget.”GHW Golf Tours can offer personally tailored packages to major golfing events, historic excursions, distillery tours, whisky tastings, castle visits, loch cruises, shooting, fishing and so much more.Talking with one of GHW’s Golf Tour consultants will show just how much is on offer. More importantly they listen and only offer a carefully curated tour. There’s nothing straight out of the box. Everything can be looked after. All you need to do is relax and concentrate on your game.The level of detail even runs to working with a company called Ship Sticks. “This means that golfers dont have to take their clubs on the flight. There are instances where clubs can go astray in transit. Golfers are rightly precious about their own clubs and when they have to use rented clubs, it really takes away something from the experience. So we can have the clubs ship to the first hotel, then they’re picked up at the end and transported back. It makes a huge dference.”It’s the care over those details that makes groupsto GHW Golf Tours.“Our drivers are much more like a concierge service. If you need a recommendation or where to locate a restaurant or a gt, they’ll know.“We can even provide helicopter transfers. When we’ve done that from St Andrews to East Lothian, the group has had the most spectacular view of flying over the Old Course, over the bridges and down to East Lothian. An amazing experience in itself.” It’s this level of attention to detail that led to the opening of a US office only two years later in , and located in Boston.“Perhaps it was having the Boston office, but we did find that the most inbound business was coming from America. But we have groups from Canada, France, Germany, Austria and Sweden. Even as far as Australia and Asia. This year we have a large group of Nigerian golfers coming over in May.”GHW Golf Tours also offers the same service to golfers looking to play the best courses across Ireland.“There are groups who only want to play championship courses and have a full luxury experience. Others are looking to play courses in one area, maybe the Highlands and islands. So we are constantly looking out for the best new experiences. No matter the budget, we can create the bespoke tour with memories that last a letime.”If there’s a fear of those memories fading, GHW Golf Tours can even organise a photographer or videographer to make sure that everyone gets a lasting record of the trip.

They include the wearing of masks, distancing, sanitising and keeping up the regular lateral flow testing and logging the results online whether positive or negative which help our colleagues in Public Health keep on top of potential community transmission.”The Scottish Government has announced new guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday, January .This will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.Businesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.The requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings # like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties # will be reduced from m to m from January .Face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.OLECG vice-chair and the council’s interim executive director of environmental, property  IT services, Hayley Green, said: “Our business continuity plans are holding up but there remains a fragility and we do not want to react in a manner that could potentially risk services, particularly frontline essential services, by implementing change too quickly # we must maintain a steady as we go approach. We do not expect any signicant changes in the meantime in terms of how we are operating.“We will consider the new guidance carefully and make decisions based on the safety of all and the resilience of our operations.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At least one of the unavailable players had to have tested positive for Covid-.Now, at least four of the players absent and leaving a club with less than the minimum  eligible players must be positive Covid- cases.There have been  postponements in the Premier under the Covid- criteria since the Omicron iant led to an increase in cases among players and staff at top-flight clubs.Following a club meeting today, the Premier Leagues COVID- match postponement guidance has been updated to include a COVID- impact thresholdFull statement: https:t.co ikcjNUWtpg pic yJJAuVnP— Premier LeagueJanuary , The Premier League also said on Wednesday that its Covid- emergency measures – which cover testing, treatment time, the wearing of face coverings and the observance of social distancing – will be reviewed weekly with a view to them expiring no later than February .While Purslow advocated for a change of criteria, Norwich manager Dean Smith said last week he did not believe anything should be altered mid-season.“We’re looking at the rules now and we’re saying they’re not fit for purpose, but they are the rules for this season,” he said.“I don’t think we should be allowed to change them during the season. There have been  postponements , each case heard on an inidual basis by the Premier League.“For me, that should continue until the end of the season, then they look at it and change whatever rules they need to at the end.”The updated league rules still allow the Premier League board to consider other factors when an application for a postponement is made, such as the status of any Covid- outbreak at a club and the proximity to the fixture in question, a club’s ability to safely prepare for a match and any advice from the UK Healthy and Security Agency or other public health bodies.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

Covid passports will no longer be legally required in bars, restaurants and cinemas but will still be needed to gain access to a club or to indoor unseated or partially seated events with  people or more.On Tuesday the Department of Health recorded , positive cases of Covid and five deaths in the past  hours.Joe said he hoped that an Executive meeting on February  would remove mandatory Covid certication in all settings to bring nightclubs and other entertainment venues into line with the rest of hospitality.And he said nightclubs had suffered more than any other hospitality setting throughout the pandemic. “It’s coming up to two years since restrictions were introduced and as of today, we’ve been closed for  weeks and open for eight,” he said.“It’s not commonly understood just how catastrophic restrictions have been for us. There have been so many dferent permutations of reopening, that people are confused by it all.“If, for example, you attended a seated concert or a comedy or magic show and wanted to stand up or dance, that hasn’t been possible for  weeks.“Without clarity, we’ve lost access to touring events. A band or DJ touring England and thinking about adding a show in Ireland is faced with a tough decisionnot sure what the rules are orthey might change at any minute.“Anyone who plays to a standing or partially standing audience might then prioritise where, so that’s been very dficult.” Joe said that while it was harder to arrange gigs hastily following last-minute lting of restrictions, the demand for nightclubs was still evidently there, particularly among students. Club nights at The Limelight are selling out fast from Wednesday through to the weekend and staff are gearing up for a busy period ahead. But he’s in no doubt about the upcoming challenges for the sector.“Hopefully this is the end of the restrictions and we can get back to planning and back to business,” he said.“But it’s going to take a long time to fully recover from the damage for many sectors including hospitality, retail and travel.”At the Kremlin nightclub, a deep clean of the premises was under way ahead of reopening and staff were brought in to ensure the sound and light systems were ready for Wednesday night.Allen Gordon said the last reopening had been ‘phenomenal’ and that he was expecting an even better turnout this time around.And he said he was hopeful for the future of the nightclub.“There has been a fantastic reaction on social media to the reopening of the club and we’re expecting a big crowd down come the weekend,” he said.“The response was phenomenal the last time we reopened and we’re expecting an even better reaction this time.“It’s been a dficult time with all the closures and reopenings but it looks like we’re coming out of it now and I don’t think this will happen again, all these restrictions being put in place.“Here’s hoping we’re at the tail end of it, plus we’re coming into the better weather. People want out.“The reopening of nightclubs is a much-needed boost for hospitality.”Most ReadDoug Beattie’s tweets: What he said then and his explanations nowEdwin Poots issues defamation proceedings against Doug Beattie and Tory MP Simon Hoare over offensive tweet about his weDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normalTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s weLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Covid rules: When can I go to a nightclub and what  is changing today NI Coronavirus travel rules: Changes for arrivals from non-red list countries‘Solutions needed’ for hospital waiting list crisisSenior civil servant Sue Gray probing Tories ‘faced down IRA hijack bid’LatestThousands of small landowners to see huge rent cuts from hosting phone mastsSenior civil servant receiving full , euro salaryLiverpool defender Nat Phillips being chased by two Premier League clubsRoy Hodgson looking forward to ‘massive challenge’ at WatfordPM accused of lying over animal charity Nowzad’s Afghan rescue as emails surface,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The building is being taken over by an art and drama group which, I believe, will have access to the required funding for a proper refurbishment.“We regard this as an exciting opportunity to literally move on to a site nearer the city centre, and we are most grateful that the Great Victoria Street Church is giving us such a warm welcome.“Our closing service this Sunday will include a number of special guests including several of our former ministers, and the Presbyterian Moderator, the Right Reverend Dr Bruce. It will certainly be a landmark occasion, and for some people an emotional occasion as well.”Over the years Windsor church, on the corner of the Lisburn Road and Derryvolgie Avenue, amalgamated with others in the South Belfast Presbytery. In  it merged with the former Broadway Presbyterian Church on the Falls Road, which is now an Irish Language Centre.

Cecil Graham, a longtime Presbyterian and elder at Windsor said: “In  in response to the increasing number of immigrants coming to Belfast, the South Belfast Presbytery in partnership with the Council for Mission in Ireland established the International Meeting Point project on the Lisburn Road.“Partnership with the IMP has been instrumental in reviving the Windsor congregation, and many of its members attend our Sunday services.” In its heyday, Windsor was one of the most fashionable and influential Presbyterian churches in Ireland. Two of its ministers became moderators — Rev John Irwin in  and Rev William Corkey in . The Corkey family in particular made a signicant contribution to the wider work of the Church, including the establishment of Adelaide House and other care homes.Windsor church has also made an important contribution to the Mission Outreach of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and particularly in China and India. During the Second World War, Windsor missionaries were imprisonment by the Japanese.It has had eight ministers in its history, including Rev Steen.The church is on the list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest.

The leak could look minimal, and some people may even think this is a design feature to keep the toilet bowl fresh.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “The worst of leaking toilets can waste up to , litres a day – which is equivalent to  bath tubs! It’s easy enough to checkyou have a leak andyou do, it’s easy to repair.”NI Water has produced a checklist which will help establisha toilet is leaking.If you can hear a flow of water when the toilet hasn’t been flushed or can see a slight but constant trickle at the back of the toilet pan, you may have a leaky loo.Wait until half an hour after the last flush then wipe the back of the pan dry with toilet tissue. Then place a new, dry sheet of toilet tissue across the back of the pan. Leave it in place for up to three hours without using the toilet . If the paper is wet or torn in the morning, you know you have a leaky loo.A free LeakyLoo strip can also be ordered by visiting www.savewatersavemoney and entering your postcode.If you have a leak they normally are pretty straight forward for an approved plumber or keen DIY-er to fix, either by adjusting or replacing the bits inside a cistern with new parts. It#s advised that the new parts are compliant with the water fittings regulations.

but later deleted it and apologised after a backlash on social media.However, at that stage it had already been retweeted a number of times.It made a reference to Mr Poots, his we and a brothel.Among those to retweet the offensive post was Mr Hoare, who is chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster.Solicitors acting for Mr Poots and his we Glynis are examining the accounts of other Twitter users to seethey are to be included in the defamation proceedings.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up In a precedent setting  High Court case, Tory peer Lord McAlpine was successful in defamation proceedings against users who retweeted untrue allegations of child sex abuse.Among those who had to pay out were Sally Bercow, we of then Commons Speaker John Bercow, and the comedian Alan Davies.Lord McAlpine’s legal counsel said at the time the latter’s “reckless retweet” of a defamatory statement “fanned the work of internet trolls”.Lord McAlpine initiated, or at least threatened, legal action against  Twitter users, with it being accepted by the court that the retweeting of a libel was actionable.Mr Beattie is still in his job despite dozens of other derogatory messages dating back to  coming to light, some containing racist, misogynist and Islamophobic slurs, as well as offensive posts about the Traveller community.On the same day the Poots tweet was posted, an opinion poll for the Belfasthad him as the most popular party leader.He has since said the posts were “pretty horric” and he was “deeply ashamed” of them.However, he denied he was a racist or a misogynist.Mr Beattie insisted the tweets were “not who I am”.Mrs Poots, a Sunday school teacher, has always shunned the limelight.She was said to be deeply upset by the Ulster Unionist leader’s post.Mr Poots originally said he accepted Mr Beattie’s apology, but he questioned his “poor” judgment in posting it in the first place.But now it has been confirmed that he is taking legal action over the post.Patrick Higgins, from solicitors Donnelly and Wall, said yesterday: “Today we instigated proceedings on behalf or Mrs and Mr Poots against Mr Beattie MLA and Mr Hoare MP who published this tweet.“This post constitutes a grave and unwarranted attack on my clients’ reputation.“As a couple of  years, married for , it has caused my clients profound distress.“As a lady who has recently retired after dedicating her le as a nurse to caring for terminally ill children, it is wholly inappropriate for any persons to make such comments, and the publication has caused immense hurt to her, her husband and their family.”Following a meeting of Ulster Unionist MLAs and party officers yesterday, it was announced Mr Beattie would remain as leader.He said: “I have had detailed conversations with all of my MLAs, I apologised for what I had done directly to each one of them, and then I spoke [about] whether or not I still had their support to remain as party leader — overwhelmingly, every one of them said ‘yes, I did’.”While there has been no public statement from senior elected members, some of the party’s junior members have come out in support.Kate Evans, who works in Mr Beattie’s constituency office, posted online that she had worked for the Upper Bann MLA for six years, adding: “I wouldn’t be the person I am todayit weren’t for his support and encouragement over those years as I recovered from domestic violence.“I don’t recognise the man in those tweets.“I accept his apology and I support him.”Julie-Anne Corr-Johnson, who joined the UUP last year as a North Belfast representative, said: “There is no other leader I trust more with my children’s future than @BeattieDoug.”Bethany Ferris, a party officer, said: “Everyone has a past. This is why I fundamentally believe in judging people for who they are now. @BeattieDoug has always been kind and supportive… I admire him for taking responsibility for his past and trust him to lead our party into the future.”Most ReadDoug Beattie’s tweets: What he said then and his explanations nowEdwin Poots issues defamation proceedings against Doug Beattie and Tory MP Simon Hoare over offensive tweet about his weDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normalTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s weLatest Northern IrelandMPs disagree over Bloody Sunday as calls emerge for army regiment apologySinn Fein MLAs apologise for offensive historical tweetsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageConsultation on plan to reshape adult social care launchedBoris Johnson claims EU enforcing NI Protocol in ‘insane and pettogging way’LatestFindings of mental health services review ‘shocking and very serious’Six Nations chief executive again rules out relegation amid Italy strugglesStatisticians to revise inflation calculations after Jack Monroe pressureMajor campaign to raise awareness of Highway Code changesGive half of young people apprenticeships to level up the country, says MP,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is understandable that there are concerns around receiving the vaccine.

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community centre and investment in other parts of the town..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Winterwatch.jpg","title":"BBC Winterwatch TV show airs live from

And as well as their cultural signicance the implications for the economic and tourism attraction of the historic centre of the county are obvious.They add: ldquoWe call on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to halt its current direction of travel and demonstrate a commitment to restoring what was an internationally recognised centre of excellence in Downpatrick.ldquoWe ask it to respect its moral responsibility to honour the trust placed in the museum by those thousands of donors and friends who expected the council to cherish and support this public treasure house of the shared histories of County Down.Last week a spokesperson for the council said it was ldquocommitted to the continuous improvement and development of its museums.The spokesperson also said a meeting was held in December with stakeholders and elected representatives to clary there would be a reduction in ldquostaff head count following the restructuring.ldquoFurther engagement with stakeholders is planned for early this year and we look forward to working with all our partners to advance the councilrsquos ambitious and exciting plans for our museum services, the spokesperson added.See Letters on pages  and ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"Down go under against Antrim  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo disappointing start to their Dr McKenna Cup campaign continued when they lost out to Antrim by two points in Newry last week.The defeat means back-to-back losses for James McCartanrsquos new-look side, despite some encouraging inidual performances throughout from the Mourne outfit.Down will count themselves unlucky not to gain anything from the contest, having gone tit for tat with the Saffrons in the first half and Barry OrsquoHagan seeing his last gasp goal bound effort ricocheting over the bar instead of hitting the back of the net.McCartanrsquos men got off to a dream start when the newly ed Niall McParland sent a long ball forward into the hands of Ryan OrsquoHiggins, who opened the scoring through a well struck goal just three minutes in.Ruairi McCann and Odhran Eastwood confidently kicked over frees to bring Antrim within one point of levelling the scores before Packie OrsquoHagan doubled Downrsquos lead just before the  minute mark.Antrim did manage to completely reduce the deficit before the first water-break, with two quick-fire scores coming from Patrick McBride and a Pat Shivers free.As the players rehydrated, the surrounding supporters at Pairc Esler were awarded time to catch their breath as the fast paced game was momentarily brought to a halt.Veteran Darren OrsquoHagan entered the fray in the place of John McGeough upon the resumption before James Laverty kicked over a point from play to give the visitors the lead for the first time in the match.A well worked attack ended with Kevin McKernan levelling proceedings once again for the hosts, and soon after captain Caolan Mooney fired over between the sticks to give his side the advantage.Things began heating up in the cold weather, with plenty of firm challenges on show.Anytime the Mourne side were edging ahead, Antrim were right on their coattails and were now starting to overpower the home side in dferent areas of the pitch.Antrimrsquos McCann kicked over two unanswered points, the first from a rsquorsquo and the second from a free, although Downrsquos sharpshooting Barry OrsquoHagan restored parity in a matter of seconds.With three minutes to the interval, McCann converted his fourth free of the night to give the Saffrons a one point lead.Half time: Down - Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

I look forward to ing soon and continuing to work on our shared interest in completing the windmill park project and heritage centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26January2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Speed sign reinstated in Saintfield in bid to halt speeding drivers  ","story":"WORK has started to reinstate an electronic speed indicator sign at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield.The sign mdash one of a number erected across the district by the arearsquos Policing and Community Partnership mdash was removed last year after concerns were expressed about its original location at the busy road.Designed to put the brakes on speeders, the signs have proved effective in a number of locations with plans to install more of them over the coming months.The reinstatement of the Saintfield sign has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who said that it will make drivers more aware of their speed at this busy road.A decision to relocate the Saintfield sign was agreed by a sub-committee of the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.Cllr Owen said she was delighted that the speed sign was being erected as it will remind drivers of their speed as they approach the built-up town centre area.Cllr Owen also thanked residents who helped her lobby for the reinstatement of the speed indicator sign following its removal.The Ballynahinch Road is one of the districtrsquos speeding hot spots with a number of high speeds recorded by the previous speed indicator sign located in a mph zone. It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %. The average number of speeding violations over mph in mph zones was almost %..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13395989.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Most of his career was spent preparing for defence against “a Russian style or former soviet style enemy”.He says the Russian naval test off Irish waters - combined with other Russian exercises around the globe at the same time - are designed to spread western military intelligence resources as thinly as possible while Russiafocuses on its objectives in the Ukraine.“They are doing it to expose an unprotected flank of NATO, through [the Republic of] Ireland as Russia knows Ireland does not have the ability to defend itself. It is making a very clear statement.”The exercise is located over the site of many of the EU’s transatlantic communication cables, which Russia knows how to tap for information, he adds.”Russia is reasserting its position and the timing is to split the UK, US and NATO surveillance abilities as it is doing so many similar exercises around the globe at the same time.”He iscertain it is all linked to what Russia is trying to achieve in Ukraine.“The Republic of Ireland’s military capabilities are completely useless in this environment. They do not have the ability from an intelligence view to monitor Russian movement around the Irish coast. Russian missile submarines spend a lot of time off the west coast of Ireland and the Republic does not have the ability to see, stop or disrupt this.“That is why when it comes to the protection of Irish air space they rely on the RAF to do so. There is an agreement in place between the Republic of Ireland and the UK for the RAF to provide that air cover.“There are similar arrangements in place with the Royal Navy. The Republic of Ireland does not pay for this protection but it is also protecting the UK’s flank, he notes.“This is where Northern Ireland is critical to the defence of the UK, from a geographic position, in being able to give it a foothold and extra reach out into the Atlantic.”The strategic position of NI for the defence of the UK is something that will “always be a consideration” to the UK government should there be a border poll, he adds.He believes Russia will invade Ukraine.“I personally think yes, they will.”The motivation is that Ukraine has been moving closer ideologically to the EU and Russia is afraid of it becoming part of NATO.Russia is exploitingthe Republic of Ireland, he says, because it cannot monitor its own waters or airspace and has weak immigration controls, so it presents a weak flank of NATO.“The Republic presents a focal point for Russian or other malign actors to either get into the EU or penetrate into the UK and wider NATO by getting intelligence agents into Ireland and therefore into the EU.”Weak passport controls allow Russian agents to enter the UK via the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, he says. Agents will also move from the Republic into France and the rest of the EU, especially on a  passport.“For many years intelligence agents around the world saw an Irish passport as the ‘go to’ second passport that intelligence agents had.People from so many parts of the world now hold Irish passports legitimately, he says, so it is a good cover.“It was always seen as a relatively easy place to get a legitimate passport from.”ButRussian agents inside NI are also “%” also an issue right now, he says.“They will be interested in any defence industries, military bases, shipyards. They will also be looking at anything they can do to disrupt normal government activity both north and south.”One example of this could be through dis-and-misinformation - for example stimulating support for a border poll, or support for loyalist or republican terrorist organisations, he says.“If they feel that it undermines Westminster or Dublin or the EU’s focus away from Russian activities, Russia will put its kne in that crack and wiggle it away as much aspossible.”Russian agents will also be likely to try and exacerbate any social grievances which might result in street protests, “at the very least through social media” he adds.Russian agents in NI are likely to speak without any accent and hold non-Russian passports. Traditionally their cover story is working as junior embassy staff, business executives or journalists.Their preferred agents to recruit may have roles such as engineers or computer experts in sensitivebusinesses or industries.Russian intelligence officers will “%” have people inside NI political parties and may fund political activities from front companies, he adds. The agents these officers run will also be locals who they recruit inside defence manufacturers in NI, for example.Russia had close links with Libya when it was supplying shiploads of mainly Soviet weaponry to the IRA, he notes.“They will be interested in exacerbating political conflict. That will be a definite aim of Russian intelligence services because it splits political thinking in Westminster and fixes it onto something , which then can’t be spent on supporting NATO, the EU or looking at the Russian threat.”They will be aiming to do this from both sides of the political spectrum at the same time in NI, he says, as well as in the south.As to spotting agents, he advises, “If you have a gut feeling something is wrong there could well be something wrong. So MI have got a hotline numberpeople are concerned about anything.”There are more Russian intelligenceofficers in the UK now than during the height of the ColdWar, he says, which would have been “several hundred” at that time.UUP MLA and former Royal Navy submarine commanderSteve Aiken says the exercise off the coast of Cork is the Russians “making very clear to NATO but more importantly to the EU that they can signicantly disrupt business and trade the economies of Europe”.The giveaway, he says, is that they are exercising above a number of keytransatlantic communication cables.”They are demonstrating their capability, bearing in mind that NATO are sending their standing forces into the Black Sea at the moment That would be seen by the Russians as a direct provocation to their intentions in the Ukraine.“But by carrying out exercises in the Atlantic, Mediterraneanand Arctic at the same time, the Russians are demonstrating their capability to be able to inflict as much damage to Europe as NATO could do to Russia.”The Republic of Ireland has acknowledged that it “can’t do anything” about the Russian exercises off its coast, he says.“This is particularlytrue as the Irish have no maritime or air capability whatsoever [in proportion to this threat]. I think the Russians are just demonstrating they can operate with impunity.“I would say it would be extraordinarily embarrassing when Simon Coveney calls in the Russian ambassadorto complain about something - but what is he going to do about it  He has no air capability and no maritime capability.”In the event of a threat to the Irish Republic from something such as a hijacked aircraft, he says, “they would have to call up the RAF to come and deal with it. They have no capability at all.”The Republic of Ireland only has radar around its airports but has no means to detect hostile aircraft around its coast or anywhere , he says.“They are quite unique in European terms in their limited military capability, aside from Malta. Every other EU countryinvests quite considerably in its defence capabilities.”The defence question should be a signicant consideration for anyone voting in a border poll, he says.“Of course. To me that has always been the case.”The UK’s presence in Northern Ireland is critical in its defence plans, he says.“One of the reasons the UK has managed to maintain its security is because it always controlled the sea lanes and airspace around and over Ireland.”As to whether Russia will invade Ukraine, hesuggests: “We are in a stage where anything could happen.”MORE NEWS:Ex-PSNI Chief Constable Hugh Orde: The Historical Enquiries Team was closed down to protect terrorists-turned-politiciansPSNI dodges ex-chief constable George Hamilton’s claim about murder of ex-IRA man Kevin McGuiganPSNI assessment of IRA Army Council relationship with Sinn Fein remains unchanged says Chief Constable Simon ByrnePSNI reveals why Paramilitary Crime Task Force investigates UVF, UDA and INLA - but not the IRAYoung unionists react to BBC’s Stephen Nolan: Why our peers don’t want to speak out in the mediaA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In the latest year tax revenues from NI amounted to only % of the cost of public services. The rest comes from taxpayers in Great Britain, from Treasury borrowing, and in the Covid crisis by the Bank of England printing new money.The main reason for this mighty uplt in spending in   was of course Covid, or to be precise, the UK government’s decisions on supporting the economy during the pandemic. The size and success of these policies has not been given its full credit. Especially in Northern Ireland there has not been sufficient recognition of how much we owe to our membership of a UK economic union which has been able to incur huge expenditure with minimal financial strain.The truly massive increase in national UK-wide public spendingwas accompanied by a fall in UK tax revenuesas the pandemic shrank the economy, and government borrowing soared to close to % of national income. In its efforts to prevent a general economic collapse and a catastrophic rise in unemployment, the Treasury spent £ billion on employment schemes including furloughing, a similar amount on the NHS, and £ billion on losses from its generous loans and loan guarantees to private firms. The measures have been a great success, with national output in late  back to pre-pandemic . The extra spending is often described as ‘tax-payers money’ but this is not correct. There has been no increase in tax rates evensome rises are in the pipeline. The pandemic measures have been completely financed by rising indebtedness, but is it not debt that needs to be repaid by future generations or that requires interest payments  In fact, nearly all of the extra finance came from the Bank of England printing new money. Although the printing of money is the most mysterious aspect of economics, what happened is relatively clear. To bridge the gap between its soaring expenses and its shrinking revenues the Treasury issued new bonds to pension funds and others. At the same time the Bank of England bought an equivalent amount of bonds from the pension and insurance industry, paid for by newly printed money. The result is that around a quarter of government bonds are now owned by the Bank of Englandand on which the government pays no interest. In this way Northern Ireland has been spared the enormous cost of financing the worst pandemic in living memory. A financially strong and independent UK allows Northern Ireland to carry on financially as though nothing untoward had happened. Nor is there a serious burden of debt to be repaid in future. My view is that the Treasury has handled the pandemic very successfully. Unemployment has hardly risen and relatively few firms gave gone bust. Some economists worry that printing money leads to inflationbut this does not necessarily follow in a temporary crisis like a pandemic. Prices have risen due to pandemic-related shortages but these rises should ease soon.Next year the government’s financial situation shouldto normal, but normal for NI means high spending on public services at % above the UK average per person. This generosity allows NI to spend more than other UK regions on key services like health, education, policing and housing. Most of the money comes as a lump sum for the NI Executive to spend as it wishes. Some decisions look decidedly odd. NI now spends less than almost any other region on economic developmentor science and technology but much more than other regions on culture arts and leisure, in the latter case more even than London on a per head basis.The largescale UK Treasury support for NI is viewed as a normal cost of maintaining the union. Support is also fairly lavish for other devolved regions although never as much as for NI. Within Northern Ireland the subsidy from GB taxpayers is a source of embarrassment and rarely discussed. It is seen as indicating a local economy too weak to pay its bills, but this not really correct. The economy is reasonably strong and grows, as expected, at about the UK average rate. However, with a traditionally highbirth rate, the population in NI expanded faster than in GB in the past. The consequence until recently was a serious shortage of jobs. Migration to GB kept the labour market in rough balance but unemployment rates were usually the highest in the UK. The national government responded by creating public sector jobs and fully funding the social security system. The Troubles increased this tendency and money poured in leading to rapid job creation. As a result, NI had less out-migration and thus a larger population than would have been the case in the absence of the UK’s largesse.In recent years with lower birth rates, out-migration has been reversed and more people come into NI each year than leave. Unemployment is now low, and living standards are quite close to the UK average not least because of the generosity of public spending but also because house prices are low. Nationalist commentators like to point to the public sector subsidies as a source of weakness but are perplexed because the high standard of public services undoubtedly persuades many Catholics to tell pollsters that they prefer the union to Irish unity. The strength of the UK economy means that this position is permanently sustainable and there is little or no political pressure to reduce the subsidies. Just the opposite in fact, since Tory economic policy is centred on levelling up living standards across the regions. The pandemic has shown again how important the UK financial union is, not least to Northern Ireland.• Dr Gudgin is honorary research associate at Centre for Business Research, Judge Business Scholl, Cambridge University and was an advisor to David Trimble as first minister——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Mondays to Fridays, from .pm."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/13313019.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast year because we were in deep lockdown it never happened and because of the current Covid rules it had to be postponed again, which is probably why only three walkers came out to meet him at the Knap car terrace in perfect walking weather, on a bright and crisp morning to join in a -mile replacement walk.On the hillside just above them are the neat foundations of a Roman Building which contained  rooms all grouped around a courtyard with the building being dated to the late rd century AD by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. It seems a natural harbour was to be found to the east of this area and one theory is that this was a guesthouse connected with naval activity at the harbour as no evidence of a water supply or baths common in villa’s could be found. In the early ’s the trust carried out excavations on site and pieces of Roman pottery and tiles were found and a public viewing  now overlooks the site.They soon warmed up due to a short but stf climb onto the clftop and followed a narrow path through woodland to descend the Golden Stairs into Porthkerry Country Park, where the frost covered board walk led them towards the ft Porthkerry Viaduct. Deviating off the cycle path at Robin’s Walk brought them into muddy fields beside the Whitelands Brook for the climb up to join the A opposite Welford and along the verge to cross a stile leading into fields behind Blackton Farm.A well-worn farm track led to the road for the journey to Penmark Village where they entered the churchyard of St Mary’s for their mid-morning refreshments, utilising the steps on the preaching cross as seating whilst enjoying the warm sunshine. The church dates to the th century being mentioned for the first time in  and a few centuries later the tower was added, but most of its medieval traits were lost when it was renovated during the Victorian era..removeThey continued and joined part of the long distance Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail, through fields on the boundary of Cardf Airport making towards Fonmon with its lovely duck pond and stunning weeping willow tree which cascades over the water. Then climbing steps into a small wood leading to muddy fields near Home Farm they eventually exited onto Port Road following it southwards to East Aberthaw.Taking time out they paused at the Blue Anchor for a swt pint outside in the fresh air before following Well Road downhill. This road was previously known as Marshe Way, one would presume because the River Thaw flowed to reach the sea by this route until the Aberthaw Power Station was built and the river was re-routed.Tramping muddy paths below the main Vale railway line through the nature reserve which is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, they headed through the reed beds beside the western end of the delightful lake, overseen by the ruined Aberthaw Limeworks built in , to arrive at the sea defence wall. Heading out onto the beach they found a suitable place for lunch sitting on a washed up tree trunk beside the dunes and overlooking the Bristol Channel and English coastline before continuing along the salt flats.The beautul refurbished clf steps on part of the Wales Coast Path brought them steeply uphill into Fontygary Leisure Park, which was eerily quiet due to the winter months and reaching Fontygary beach, they continued up steps following the coast path past the old disused limestone quarries to reach the southernmost tip of mainland Wales and Rhoose Point. Onward through Porthkerry Holiday Park and the Iron Age hillfort at the Bulwarks, to slither downhill through the woods back into Porthkerry for the steep climb back up the Golden Stairs in order to make their way along the clftop to Cold Knap, just as the sun was sinking in the western sky.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church – which had a well named after Dwynwen – can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs..removeShe is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They also hosted live music with three musicians from Hong Kong over a weekend in November. “Music was one of the things that people said they wanted more of in Carrick on their Wildest Dreams postcards,” Lee explained.Sails and Tales successMeanwhile, the ongoing Sails and Tales exhibition explores  years of history through key events and stories relating to the maritime history of the town. From January to April , in the depths of lockdown, local people came together online to share their memories, interests, and photos, helping to shape their exhibition at the refurbished Kelly’s Coal Office.

Marked with the iconic ‘K’, it has been known as Kelly’s ever since. Within a changing s economy, the business closed in the mid-s, and the building fell into disrepair, eventually being placed on the Buildings at Risk Register. “Thankfully, the current owner was able to secure funding from the Carrickfergus Townscape Heritage Initiativein  and the building has been brought back to le. The coal office is now home to the family-run business Robinson’s Shoes,” Lee added. “We will shortly launch a virtual reality tour of the exhibition which was funded through donations from the community.“As well as gathering people’s harbour stories online last year, we held a number of online events at the start of  before opening our shop in June . “We’ve held a range of conversations in the shop, music events, art classes and collaborative mapping workshops, taking people on a tour of the town and coming together to make maps that tell their stories of their towns and their aspirations for the future. “We’ve also supported local businesses and community groups who have used our shop space for meetings and as a pop up shop.”Plans for the year aheadAs for the coming year, Positive Carrickfergus is putting together plans to take forward the Wildest Dreams work and developing projects with a number of other organisations, such as Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and the Eco Rangers.Their work was also recognised in December  as the Best Community or Social Initiative award at the Carrickfergus Business Excellence Awards.To find out more about the group and any upcoming events, visit the website at https:positivecarrickfergus.org "},{"url":null,"title":"carrickfergus road closed after serious road traffic collision ","story":"Lidl and BQ accidentally sell rare plants worth £, for just £   Four casualties taken to Craigavon Area Hospital after crash in Co DownNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsCarrickfergus road closed after serious road traffic collisionMotorists are advised that the Knockagh Road, Carrickfergus is currently closed following a serious road traffic collision.By News ReporterWednesday, th January , : amUpdated Wednesday, th January , : am  \"       \"  A PSNI spokesperson said: \"Please seek an alternative route for your journey.\"       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
