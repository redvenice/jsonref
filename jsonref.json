After the DMK’s first election, Karunanidhi was promoted as the treasurer of the party in 1961 and became deputy leader of the Opposition a year later.Under Annadurai’s leadership, the party came to power in 1967 and Karunanidhi became the minister for the public works department before being made the Chief Minister after the leader’s death.Karunanidhi continued the work of his predecessor: Annadurai’s desire to transform Centre-state relations and resist anything that could infringe on the Tamil Nadu’s prerogatives, keeping enough power within the state and so much that the integrity of the country as a whole would be maintained.However, in 1974, Karunanidhi’s DMK government passed a resolution in the Tamil Nadu Assembly that urged the Centre to make ‘immediate changes in the Constitution of Indian to establish a truly federal set-up with full state autonomy’.

We will not achieve this if women are excluded and if their voices are not heard.\u0027Right now, around 30 per cent of those on our approved candidates list are women. This is not enough. That\u0027s why I am setting out an ambition here today – to have women make up 50 per cent of our candidates list.\u0027This is not an easy ambition. But we have a duty to achieve it and I will personally work tirelessly to make this a reality.\u0027  Women MPs elected at UK general elections Mr Lewis was criticised recently for breaking a pairing arrangement with Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson, who was unable to take part in a crunch Brexit vote because she was on maternity leave.He repeated his apology to Ms Swinson for what he said was a \u0027mistake\u0027, and insisted that he did not know at the time that he had been paired with her, in an arrangement between the parties to cancel out the impact of MPs being unavoidably absent.Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u0027s Woman\u0027s Hour, Mr Lewis made clear Tories were not following Labour\u0027s lead in operating all-women shortlists for candidates.\u0027In terms of quotas and shortlists, I think that just masks the underlying problems within organisations,\u0027 he said. \u0027We need to change the culture across our political landscape, get that systemic change, not just a short-term fix.\u0027Mr Lewis said that two out of the three Conservative candidates selected so far for the general election expected in 2022 have been women.\u0027This is a promising start,\u0027 he said. \u0027But in order to reach our ambition, we need to have a wider strategy.\u0027He promised further action to \u0027level the playing field\u0027 between male and female candidates.  The UK´s first female prime minster was Conservative Margaret Thatcher in 1979 \u0027We now require association selection panels to reflect their local areas – including gender balance – to help ensure that at every stage women are treated fairly and equally,\u0027 he said.The party has commissioned research to examine why women do not put themselves forward as candidates, which will be used \u0027to take action to break down barriers wherever they exist, and provide the practical steps to overcome them\u0027.Conservative councils will be encouraged to offer better paternity and maternity policies, a new Young Women\u0027s Network will be established and the party will provide mentoring and shadowing opportunities to women considering standing for election.Mr Lewis\u0027s announcement was welcomed by women\u0027s rights pressure group the Fawcett Society.But the society\u0027s chief executive, Sam Smethers, added: \u0027The challenge now is how they roll this out at constituency level, address attitudinal and procedural barriers and get those women into winnable seats.\u0027The Conservative Party chairman has today also committed to introducing maternity, paternity and parental leave policies for councillors in Conservative-run councils.\u0027We know that just four per cent of councils in England and Wales have policies in place.

The Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust report concluded: \u0027It is clear from the evidence that Nurse Abdullah was treated unfairly\u0027Mr Abdullah \u0027should have known that signing the petition was not appropriate\u0027, the independent report said, however it noted that none of the other 18 signatories was disciplined for their involvement. Writing the letter was also \u0027a mistake\u0027, according to the report.\u0027However, the evidence indicates that Nurse Abdullah wrote it for a specific purpose and intending only Nurse X to see it,\u0027 it added. \u0027This may have been naive but we found no evidence that it was malicious.\u0027During the disciplinary process, the investigating officer \u0027failed to disclose evidence which was critical of her but which tended to exculpate Nurse Abdullah\u0027, the report found.The trust \u0027should consider the implications for the investigating officer\u0027s integrity and, ultimately, her suitability for her role as a senior member of staff\u0027, it added.A disciplinary hearing took place three months later on December 16 – a delay the report described as \u0027troubling\u0027 – and Mr Abdullah was dismissed by email on December 21.The investigation also criticised a report produced by a senior HR manager after Mr Abdullah\u0027s death as a \u0027whitewash\u0027 which \u0027served to reassure the trust that it had handled the case with due care and attention\u0027.Professor Orchard said the trust accepted the findings and recommendations of the report. It has also commissioned an overhaul of how disciplinary processes are managed.He said: \u0027I very much regret that Amin is not here to be offered an apology for the mistakes that we made and a personal commitment from me that we will act on all of the learning from his case.\u0027A coroner at an inquest held last year ruled Mr Abdullah had \u0027killed himself while the balance of his mind was disturbed\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/08/09/4EEC8E5A00000578-0-image-a-6_1533717316812.jpg","title":"Traffic jams cost commuters 55 hours sleep year leave house 13 minutes early daily","story":"    Last year, the Centre for Economics and Business Research estimated that congestion would cost the British economy more than £300billion by 2030Four per cent said they had been late for a job interview thanks to gridlock on the road, according to research commissioned by public transport provider the Go-Ahead Group.Official figures show that traffic congestion is getting worse, with delays on A roads up by more than 10 per cent since 2014.Last year, the Centre for Economics and Business Research estimated that congestion would cost the British economy more than £300 billion by 2030.How did they survive that?

They\u0027re enormous and then there\u0027s five over here and five over there, 15 in total.\u0027There\u0027s identical formations in three different areas and they don\u0027t look nature made, they don\u0027t look man made, certainly nothing I\u0027ve ever seen based on my experience and I have years of experience at doing this, we\u0027ve identified multiple different types of shipwreck material, this doesn\u0027t match or look anything like that.\u0027The deepest part of the site is 300 feet below the surface, ers had to use special breathing apparatus and a state of the art submarine to access it.The explorer also found other bizarre and unexplained formations around the main object, all of which are covered in thick coral which he believes are hundreds if not thousands of years old.Blown away by the discovery, when back on board his ship, Miklos decided to dig further into Cooper\u0027s files to find further clues.Significantly, the astronaut had written \u0027unidentified object\u0027 on the chart of the area rather than mentioning any historical shipwreck.\u0027I investigated some of Gordon\u0027s charts, I realized that there was something else on there that Gordon was referring to,\u0027 he said.\u0027Then it made sense to me why it wasn\u0027t identified as a shipwreck... he had to mean it might be something from another world.\u0027Gordon believed in aliens. He believed that we had visitors from other planets and he also believed that a lot of these things landed in this particular part of the world.\u0027          The treasure hunter has made the astonishing \u0027unexplained\u0027 discovery deep beneath the Bermuda Triangle.  Miklos believes  it could provide the first evidence of an extra-terrestrial visit to earth hundreds of years ago.          The deepest part of the site is 300 feet below the surface, ers had to use special breathing apparatus and a state of the art submarine to access itGordon Cooper successfully piloted the Mercury-Atlas 9 Faith 7 Spacecraft around the Earth 22 times in 1963 paving the way for men to reach the Moon.He was a pioneer who became the first American to sleep in space and the first to fly twice.He was also the first American televised from space.But as well as researching the limits of human endurance he was also charged with a secret spy mission while in orbit.Using special \u0027long range detection equipment\u0027 Cooper was asked by the US government to look for \u0027nuclear threats\u0027 - which likely meant Russian submarines or nuclear missile sites.But Miklos says Cooper - an avid treasure hunter - also noted the positions of Caribbean shipwrecks while he conducted this spy mission, and created a map on his return to Earth.The shipwreck hunter claims long time friend Cooper gave him the maps - which included detailed charts and exact coordinates - after he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u0027s and then died in 2004 aged 77.In the first season of the show Miklos and his team used Cooper\u0027s map to make a remarkable discovery in the Caribbean - a centuries-old anchor believed to be from one of Christopher Columbus’ ships.Cooper\u0027s maps led Miklos to dozens of other significant ship wrecks across the Caribbean worth millions of dollars.But with this latest discovery the Californian is conscious of being labeled \u0027crazy\u0027 by coming out with wild claims that Cooper\u0027s map might now have led him to an alien spaceship submerged under the ocean.That\u0027s why he says he wants to remain \u0027neutral\u0027 until he can investigate the mysterious site further.Miklos and TV production company AMPLE Entertainment are now hoping the Discovery Channel will commission a third season of Cooper\u0027s Treasure so they can do just that.

(Photo by Rolls PressPopperfotoGetty Images)Miklos said: \u0027I want to investigate it. I want to see what it is, because it may be nature made, just a freak of nature, but given its placement in this particular part of the Caribbean and given what Gordon has told me about visitors from another planet and the things that I\u0027ve seen, I think it\u0027s definitely worthwhile investigating.\u0027AMPLE Entertainment founders Ari Mark and Phil Lott, who are behind Cooper\u0027s Treasure, are equally as excited.Mark told DailyMail.com: \u0027In the first two seasons we didn\u0027t enter too far into Cooper\u0027s UFO interests and what he had told Darrell about what he had seen.\u0027I don\u0027t feel like we\u0027ve even scratched the surface of what\u0027s in Cooper\u0027s files, but that\u0027s what we hope to do in a third season.\u0027The bottom line is that Cooper spotted anomalies and it is his maps that led Darrell to this discovery.\u0027Cooper was a reliable source for treasure, then based on his findings Darrell found something that does not appear to be a shipwreck or anything that anybody has ever seen.\u0027We want to find out exactly what it is and establish whether it ties in with Cooper\u0027s belief that we\u0027re not alone.\u0027During his post-NASA career, former US Air Force Cooper became well known as an outspoken believer in UFOs and claimed the government was covering up its knowledge of extra-terrestrial activity.\u0027I believe that these extra-terrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets, which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth,\u0027 he told a United Nations panel in 1985.\u0027I feel that we need to have a top-level, coordinated program to scientifically collect and analyze data from all over the Earth concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interface with these visitors in a friendly fashion.\u0027He added: \u0027For many years I have lived with a secret, in a secrecy imposed on all specialists and astronauts. I can now reveal that every day, in the USA, our radar instruments capture objects of form and composition unknown to us.\u0027Miklos said Cooper often told him stories of UFO sightings and believed a lot of the world\u0027s technological advances had been passed on to governments by messengers from alien planets.Cooper even designed his own miniature \u0027UFO\u0027 based on an alien design he claimed to have seen.          Using special \u0027long range detection equipment\u0027 Cooper was asked by the US government to look for \u0027nuclear threats\u0027 - which likely meant Russian submarines or nuclear missile sites. But Miklos says Cooper - an avid treasure hunter - also noted the positions of Caribbean shipwrecks while he conducted this spy mission, and created a map on his return to Earth. The shipwreck hunter claims long time friend Cooper gave him the maps - which included detailed charts and exact coordinates  Miklos said Cooper often told him stories of UFO sightings and believed a lot of the world\u0027s technological advances had been passed on to governments by messengers from alien planets          Producers Ari Mark (top left) and Phil Lott (top right) with treasure hunter Miklos, host of Discovery Channel\u0027s \u0027Cooper\u0027s TreasureBut as for Cooper being a UFO \u0027nut job\u0027, Miklos couldn\u0027t disagree more.He described him as a \u0027close friend\u0027 and \u0027father figure\u0027 who was of \u0027sane mind\u0027.\u0027I can tell you one thing for sure, there was a lot of conspiracy theorists and UFO nut jobs that he wanted nothing to do with,\u0027 said Miklos.\u0027Just because he had actual encounters with something that he couldn\u0027t explain and other encounters to which he did have an explanation for, but he wasn\u0027t going to go and befriend all of these crazy different types of groups.\u0027In the early days he wasn\u0027t going to overstep the bounds of what he could reveal out of fear of getting killed (by the government) and what good would that do. So he kept a lid on it, he kept a lot of it quiet until later in his life.\u0027So the man I knew wasn\u0027t a whack job, he wasn\u0027t hallucinating and he wasn\u0027t making things up to gain attention, that wasn\u0027t him.\u0027He truly believed in what he saw and he tried to tell it in such a way to make people believe it and he knew because of his background in NASA as a rocket scientist that he was more credible than most.\u0027Nevertheless, Cooper was often discredited for expressing his beliefs on extra-terrestrial activity, but Miklos added: \u0027As serious as I\u0027m talking here right now with a clear mind to you, that\u0027s who he was.\u0027He was an honest, straight forward inidual who only wanted to investigate and explore the possibilities of the unknown, even if it meant risking his professional career.\u0027The next episode of Cooper\u0027s Treasure airs this Friday on the Discovery Channel at 9pm (PST) "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/08/18/4EF048C400000578-6038681-The_sports_star_can_be_seen_crouching_next_to_the_man_and_placin-m-12_1533749342318.jpg","title":"Ben Stokes arrives day affray trial","story":"Ben Stokes (left) and Ryan Ali (right, pictured following the incident) are both facing court           The sports star can be seen crouching next to the man and placing his shirt underneath the male\u0027s head          The sportsman\u0027s hand is pictured after he was arrested as today police shared pictures of his and other injuries   Ryan Ali (left) was injured during the row as England cricketer Ben Stokes\u0027 injuries were also revealed (right)Stokes added that his \u0027perception was that it was two against one\u0027 and he feared the men had more weapons.Stokes is on trial at Bristol Crown Court accused of calling a bouncer a \u0027c***\u0027 and mimicking two gay men last September.Minutes later Stokes allegedly punched ex-soldier Ryan Hale and emergency services worker Ryan Ali to the ground.Hale, 27, and Ali, 28, who are also accused of affray, held glass bottles during the brawl and one brandished a metal pole, witnesses have said.  But community support officer Andrew Spure, who was at a colleague\u0027s leaving do at Mbargo nightclub in Bristol at the time, claimed Stokes was the \u0027main aggressor\u0027.           Ben Stokes (pictured with wife Clare during a court break today) was the \u0027main aggressor\u0027 in the fight, Bristol Crown Court heardIn a statement written hours later, Mr Spure told how he had left the club and \u0027saw a group of people fighting\u0027, adding: \u0027One of the males struck the other in the head with a clenched fist\u0027.Bristol Crown Court heard it was Stokes who had struck Ali, knocking him to the floor and leaving him with a shattered eye socket.Asked about separating Stokes and Ali, Mr Spure said: \u0027The inidual seemed to be the main aggressor or was progressing forward trying to get to another inidual.\u0027In my statement I describe him as a gentleman with ginger or light brown hair. He had a green T-shirt on.\u0027He said Ali \u0027seemed to be trying to back away or get away from the situation\u0027 before he was punched by Stokes. Mr Spure said in his statement that Ali had facial injuries and a bloodied eye and was \u0027completely unable to move\u0027.  The court heard he identified Stokes to police officers, who then arrested the cricketer. PC Stacey Alway told the court how she was on duty with a colleague in a patrol car when they saw a man, Ali, lying in a carriageway  with another person tending to him.

From the moment I approached him (Stokes) he calmed down and he was completely compliant with me.\u0027She confirmed she arrested Stokes on suspicion of assault and cautioned him. The footage taken from the camera she was wearing was played to the jury.The court heard that PC Alway walked over to Stokes and told him: \u0027A guy over there was covered in blood and I\u0027ve been told you punched him.\u0027And Stokes replied: \u0027Because he was abusing my two friends for being gay.\u0027          The England cricketer (pictured today at Bristol Crown Court with his wife Clare) is said to have bullied two gay revellers, throwing a cigarette at one and making mocking gestures at themThe Durham and England player said in a statement given to the police and read to Bristol crown court that he became involved in a violent street fight because he feared being violently attacked by two men carrying weapons as he intervened to protect a gay couple on the receiving end of homophobic abuse.Stokes said he did not mimic Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor and had not flicked a cigarette butt at them. Gordon Cole QC, defending Stokes, asked Pc Alway to confirm that his client was \u0027calm and compliant\u0027 with her when he was arrested.\u0027He asked whether you could loosen the handcuff on his right hand? He said it was because it had been injured, not because of what happened but because he had three operations on it?\u0027          England cricketer Ben Stokes and his wife Clare arrive at Bristol Crown Court todayThe officer replied: \u0027Yes, that is correct.\u0027  Mr Cole asked: \u0027You loosened the handcuff and he thanked you for it?\u0027  She replied: \u0027Yes.\u0027During the footage played to the court, Stokes can be heard asking PC Alway: \u0027Is there going to be any sort of cameras around here?\u0027He said to the officer: \u0027Have those two other guys gone? What about two other lads - gay guys?\u0027Teammate Alex Hales told PC Alway that he had not witnessed the alleged fight.\u0027I came after you guys turned up,\u0027 he told her.When she told him to leave Stokes, who had been placed in a police vehicle, Mr Hales replied: \u0027I feel bad. He\u0027s my best friend. I saw him after everything happened.\u0027Pc Alway told Mr Hales that Stokes had money on him and so would be able to get home after being released from custody.Mr Hales asked Stokes: \u0027I don\u0027t want to go. Are you sure? I turned up after the whole thing.\u0027PC Alway told the court that she did not take Mr Hales\u0027s details. \u0027He told me that he didn\u0027t witness anything so I didn\u0027t ask him,\u0027 she said.When in the police car, Stokes appears to mouth at Mr Hales something like \u0027Come with me\u0027 or \u0027You\u0027re with me\u0027.Stokes and his teammate Mr Hales were out celebrating the England cricket team\u0027s victory over the West Indies in a one-day international in the city. Detective Constable Daniel Adams, the case\u0027s officer, told the jury that CCTV footage appears to show Mr Hales behind Stokes and Stokes approaching a retreating Ali.\u0027From this point it is very difficult to identify who is involved,\u0027 he said.Hale is then shown collapsing to the floor outside a shop window but picking himself up after 20 seconds and disappearing from view and then returning.\u0027Ryan Hale returns with what appears to be a metal pole with a T-bar on it, as described by (witness) Lauren Sweeney,\u0027 the officer said. He told the jury that it was \u0027very difficult to tell\u0027 in the CCTV what Hale was doing with the pole. \u0027He is making his way back towards the melee carrying the bar,\u0027 he said.    The England cricketer is accused of knocking out Ryan Hale (left), 27 and Ryan Ali (right), 28Nicholas Corsellis, prosecuting, asked: \u0027Do you see Ryan Hale put that implement down before he gets to the group?\u0027 The officer replied: \u0027No.\u0027Cameras belonging to Bristol City Council captured some of the aftermath of the alleged incident with police officers and an ambulance arriving at the scene.Hale places his T-shirt under the head of Ali, who is lying on the ground, while off-duty special constable Mark Spure arrived.Meanwhile, Stokes has been arrested and is sitting in the rear of a police car.Mr Hales is with one of the attending police officers before making a telephone call and heading towards a taxi rank to get a taxi.  Earlier, the jury watched CCTV taken from outside the Lola Lo club in Bristol on September 25 last year, which shows Ali and Hale, with bottles of beer in their hands, walking up the road with gay revellers Kai Barry and William O\u0027Connor.          Stokes and teammate Alex Hales were together (pictured on the night) after celebrating with the England cricket team, who had just beaten the West Indies in a one-day internationalStokes and Hales are seen catching up with them and overtaking them and then, the prosecution claim, Stokes can be seen turning to look back at Mr Barry and Ali.Detective Constable Adams said: \u0027Ryan Ali and Kai Barry appear to be having a disagreement. Mr Barry grabs Mr Ali around the groin area.\u0027The CCTV shows Mr Barry walk away from Ali but then return. DC Adams said: \u0027Mr Barry appears to link arms with Mr Ali and is shrugged off and pushed away.\u0027Further CCTV from the Be At One bar was played to the court, which showed Stokes and Mr Hales in shot and then Ali, Hale, Mr O\u0027Connor and Mr Barry coming into view.The camera later records the police and an ambulance arriving at the scene. The jury then watched CCTV taken from the nearby NatWest Bank.Detective Constable Adams told the jury: \u0027Alex Hales crosses the road towards the direction of Natwest in the direction of STA Travel.\u0027Ben Stokes is crossing the road from the same direction and meets Mr Hales. They are both looking back up Queen\u0027s Road in the direction of Be At One and Lola Lo. Ben Stokes is smoking.\u0027        Stokes starred in the cricket last week (pictured) as England beat India at Edgbaston\u0027He got a bit verbally abusive towards myself. He mentioned my gold teeth and he said I looked like a **** and I replied, \u0027Thank you very much\u0027. \u0027I said they could call me what they liked, it still wouldn\u0027t change the fact they weren\u0027t getting in. They could swear, shout – I wouldn\u0027t rise to it.\u0027He mentioned my tattoos and how s*** they were. He just looked at me and told me my tattoos were s*** and to look at my job, which he obviously wasn\u0027t happy about for keeping him out.\u0027When asked what sort of tone Stokes was using, Mr Cunningham replied: \u0027Quite a spiteful tone, quite an angry tone.\u0027 Stokes, 27, faces a single count of affray. He is standing trial alongside Hale, 27, and Ali, 28 – two men he allegedly knocked out in a brawl near the club.Prosecutors allege trouble flared after England and Durham star Stokes and Mr Hales caught up with Ali, Hale, Mr O\u0027Connor and Mr Barry on a nearby street. The cricketer is accused of knocking out Hale and Ali. Ali allegedly threatened Mr Hales with a bottle, with Hale said to have picked up a metal pole from a street sign.Stokes claims he was acting in self-defence and took action after Ali and Hale were homophobic towards Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor. But Nicholas Corsellis, prosecuting, said Stokes was instead acting with \u0027revenge, retaliation or punishment in mind\u0027.The jury also heard allegations that Mr Hales kicked the prostrate Ali in the head. Mr Hales was not arrested but interviewed under caution in connection with the fight. He was never charged.The Nottinghamshire batsman, 29, had been credited by the prosecution with trying to calm the fight. But when the jury were shown footage of the incident by Detective Constable Daniel Adams, Hale\u0027s barrister Stephen Mooney asked him: \u0027What I am going to suggest you see here is Alex Hales stamping down upon Ryan Ali at least twice. Does that accord with what you see?\u0027DC Adams replied: \u0027Yes, a stamp or a kick.\u0027 Mr Mooney said: \u0027We have someone lying on the floor, Ryan Ali, and just above him, moving towards him is Mr Alex Hales. Would it be fair to describe that as Alex Hales kicking the man in the head?\u0027DC Adams replied: \u0027That\u0027s what it looks like, yes.\u0027 Mr Mooney said: \u0027Well, it isn\u0027t what it looks like – it\u0027s what it is.\u0027 DC Adams replied: \u0027Yes.\u0027Mr Mooney said: \u0027Ryan Hale has just been in a situation with Mr Stokes and Mr Ali. \u0027At the same time, Mr Hales has come in and used deliberate force with a shod foot, stamping down upon Ryan Ali to his body, then kicking him deliberately and in a considered fashion to his head? DC Adams replied: \u0027He has definitely used his feet on three occasions.\u0027Stokes, of Castle Eden, County Durham, and Ali and Hale, both of Bristol, all deny affray. The trial continues."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/10/06DFDADA000003E8-0-image-m-8_1533549494623.jpg","title":"Conservatives set aim women make 50 election candidate list","story":"    Party Chairman Brandon Lewis says the Conservatives must better reflect the society that they wish to represent A proposal last year by the Commons Women and Equalities Committee to set a 45 per cent female representation target for Parliament and local councils was rejected by the Government.Mr Lewis made clear he was not imposing a quota or target or the introduction of all-female shortlists, and said that local Conservative Associations would continue to have the final say in selections.Tory party chairman calls for Boris Johnson to apologise...Remainers stick the knife into Boris Johnson as they pile in...Share this articleBut he said in a speech: \u0027We need the best people in our Parliament and in our party, representing their communities up and down the country.

The Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust report concluded: \u0027It is clear from the evidence that Nurse Abdullah was treated unfairly\u0027Mr Abdullah \u0027should have known that signing the petition was not appropriate\u0027, the independent report said, however it noted that none of the other 18 signatories was disciplined for their involvement.

We see him standing at the beginning of western philosophy and surveying something like virgin territory. Did it feel like that at the time? He didn’t know, obviously, that he was an Ancient – at the start of things, as we now see it, rather than, say, at their end. He was interdisciplinary before there were really disciplines to worry about. Look at him, romping across the territory of possible human knowledge like a big dog snapping at butterflies, or Theresa May running through a field of wheat. One moment he invents literary theory. At another he formulates the rules of human persuasion. Whoops: politics. Bang! Catharsis! Hello: musicology. Ethics! Psychology! And while we’re at it who wants to know how a cuttlefish works?The range and subtlety of his thought are almost inexpressibly thrilling, and it’s a mark against Edith Hall’s mostly lucid trot through what Aristotle can do for us that, in modernising and domesticating him, and making him instrumental in a self-help format, some of that thrill is lost. Mind you, it may be that this wasn’t the book on Aristotle she wanted to write so much as the only one she could publish. The fuse was probably lit for the highbrow self-help boom by Alain de Botton’s How Proust Can Change Your Life in 1997. In the two decades since, the puckish irony of De Botton’s title has burned off like morning dew. “How X Can Change Your Life” is publishing boilerplate these days. That’s not to write off the whole genre. As De Botton and his compadre Roman Krznaric have argued, lots of ancient philosophy was self-help, and the Nicomachean Ethics – with its inquiry into how best to live – certainly answers that description. Though, as Hall makes clear, Aristotle is everywhere preoccupied with the question of how we live in relation to others, rather than offering life lessons as the spiritual equivalent of a selfie-ready workout in the gym.And of its type this isn’t too bad. Here, largely, is Aristotle in paraphrase or boiled down – “We can extract a kind of formula,” Hall writes in one slightly heart-heavying moment. That paraphrase is surefooted she’s admirably clear in emphasising how Aristotle is everywhere and so attractively practical, sensible, moderate, attentive to human nature and resistant to imposing grand or rigid schemes on the world. She credits him with noticing how we can sin by omission as well as commission, for instance. And talking about “equity”, or the idea that the spirit of a law matters more than the letter, she uses his analogy of the masons of Lesbos, who “measure curving stones with a flexible ruler made of lead”.But some of his freshness and particularity, in being packaged as formulas and bromides, is gone. And she’s loose-ish. Occasionally she’ll play on an English pun, such as the connotations of “well” in “living well”, or “realising” in “realising your potential”, which may be suggestive but short-circuits the Greek. And she writes: “he had written so eloquently” on rhetoric, when current best guesses have it that his Rhetoric was assembled from his students’ notes on his lectures. When Aristotle is quoted, especially on natural history, the voltage goes right up. (Though, groan: “If he were alive today, like Sir David Attenborough he would be making wonderful TV nature documentaries.”) Here is Aristotle on nest-building birds, and an elephant’s trunk, and the tightfisted man (pheidolos, glischros, kimbix, or kuminopristes – a man so miserly he’d saw a cumin seed in half), and adultery, and a wren “hardly larger than a locust” that “has a crest of bright red gold, and is in every way a beautiful and graceful little bird”.Hall, like one of those Christians who wears a WWJD bangle, is seldom slow to ask: “What Would Aristotle Do?” We learn how he’d cater a lunch party with picky guests, how he’d advise you to fill in your CV and why he’d be concerned about global warming.And I had to wonder, slightly, about her in-his-footsteps approach: “He lived in eight erse Greek places (see the map at the beginning of the book), and in April 2016 I visited them all to better understand his experiences,” she writes in her introduction. Greece has changed a good deal since the 1970s I’m not sure what you’ll pick up about what it was like in the fourth century BC from a month-long holiday now. Her main discovery seems to have been that Chalcis, where Aristotle went at the end of his life, “was and still is a healthful, breezy seaside town”.But if you ignore the fluff, here’s a clear and frequently interesting survey of Aristotle’s thought on everything from virtue, work and friendship to the natural world, God and the good death, together with biographical snippets and personal reflections, from an author who has clearly read Aristotle well and thoughtfully and many subsequent philosophers to boot. So, as Aristotle would certainly have asked had he been writing this review, why should I be a kuminopristes about it?• Aristotle’s Way is published by Bodley Head.

Tory ideologues see state spending as inimical\u0026nbspto enterprise and corrosive of personal freedom, but pragmatists recognise that public service users do not feel austerity as a kind of liberation.To reconcile the two positions, David Cameron invented the “big society” – the idea that voluntary work could fill gaps in government provision of services. But piecemeal good work done under the “big society” banner could never soften blows from the chancellor’s axe.Still, the Conservatives have not abandoned the idea that voluntarism can repair the social fabric. On Thursday, the government launches its civil society strategy, presented as a reform to harness the resources of public, private and charitable sectors alike to the goal of “building a fairer society for all”. It is strikingly reminiscent of the\u0026nbspbig society, although the culture department overlooks the comparison when declaring its new programme to be the first exercise of its kind in 15 years.Modest sums of money are involved – £165m ided between various projects. To put that in perspective, Northamptonshire county council alone faces a deficit of £70m this year. The combined shortfall in funding for English county councils is around £6bn. To stave off\u0026nbspbankruptcy, local authorities face limiting themselves\u0026nbspto the provision of skeleton services.That presages a hollowing out of local communities on a scale that the government’s new strategy cannot begin to address. Even the new spending is illusory. The bulk of it comes from “dormant bank and building society accounts”, which is a Whitehall euphemism for money to be found down the back of a sofa. (Past beneficiaries from this accounting wheeze include Big Society Capital, the fund set up to\u0026nbspsupport\u0026nbspMr Cameron’s pet project.)The ambition of nurturing civil society is laudable\u0026nbspand the argument that charities and community groups often know better how to meet local needs than central state bodies is also valid. But\u0026nbspfor such a mechanism to be effective there must be partnership and balance between state and non-state providers. That is hard to achieve when the main thrust of national policy is to withdraw resources from local government.In some areas, notably the NHS, ministers grasp that cuts have reached the limit of what is politically sustainable. Tory MPs and councillors are increasingly raising the alarm over what is happening at local level. The penny has dropped: services suffer when starved of money people suffer when services waste away and those people express their anger and\u0026nbspfrustration in the polling booth.That insight does not yet appear to have spread very far through the upper echelons of the party. There is something sad and ridiculous in the launch of a “civil society strategy” imagining new institutions to support local communities, when the existing political structures, the democratically mandated authorities that have always fulfilled that purpose, are collapsing in a fiscal famine imposed with ideological motive by central government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd8fd0caa05d27401f745a51ca6514e3a165651d/0_0_2545_1531/master/2545.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d1d2e8061f4454c34be1110fb3e7093","title":"schools broken radical action education","story":"From failed free schools to poor funding and inequality, education needs drastic reform to create a fairer modelEven for the sceptical, the suddenness and speed with which the academy schools project has fallen from public grace is remarkable. After years of uncritical acceptance of official claims that academies, and free schools, offer a near cast-iron guarantee of a better-quality education, particularly for poorer pupils, there is now widespread recognition of the drear reality: inadequate multi-academy trusts failing thousands of pupils, parents increasingly shut out of their children’s education, and academy executive heads creaming off excessive salaries – in some cases almost three times higher than the prime minister – from a system perilously squeezed of funds.Crisis can be an overworked term in politics, and our schools are good examples of public institutions, subject to years of poor political decisions, that continue to do remarkable work. But along with the academy mess, we can add the following to the current charge sheet of what should be (along with the NHS) our finest public service: pressing problems with recruitment and retention of teachers rocketing stress among young children and teenagers subject to stringent testing and tougher public exams and the ongoing funding crisis.For those who have been closely observing developments in education over the years, none of this comes as much of a surprise. The reckless damage of the coalition years was, after all, only an exaggerated version of cross-party policy during the previous two decades: central government control-freakery allied to the wilful destruction of local government and the parcelling out of schools to untested rich and powerful iniduals and groups, including religious organisations. From early years to higher education, every sector of our system is now infected with the arid vocabulary of metrics and the empty lingo of the market.So what now? It is clear that the Tories have run out of ideas, bar the expansion of grammars. This autumn, following widespread consultation, the Labour party will publish its eagerly awaited plans for a national education service, an idea that Jeremy Corbyn has made clear he would like to see form the centrepiece of any future Labour administration.For the progressive left, then, this is an important but tricky moment that requires two distinct approaches, both of which befit a potential government-in-waiting and an avowedly radical party.The first is a calm, collegial pragmatism: addressing the immediate problems of our system, from teacher workload to reform of school accountability, loosening the screws on university teaching and research, and properly funding the all-important early years.Here, a little political inventiveness might not go amiss. Why not tot up the money spent on unnecessary, damaging reforms and announce that equivalent sums will now be redirected to areas where they are clearly needed? Billions have been spent on the academy transfer market, failed free schools, funding the shadowy regional schools commissioners, subsidising private education: in future, let’s use that kind of money to improve special-needs provision, build up adult and further education, or send teachers to regions where it is proving impossible to recruit and retain staff.Stop the excessive testing of primary-age children and spend the money on steadier, less cliff-edge forms of assessment. Implement the Headteachers’ Roundtable proposal for a national baccalaureate, an initiative that would immediately broaden the educational experience of every secondary-age pupil, with minimal disruption. Time, too, to learn the lessons of our global neighbours and phase out selection, reform unfair school admissions, and bring education back into public hands. As Lucy Crehan shows in CleverLands, an absorbing study of top-performing school systems around the world, many of these – including Finland and Canada – do not select or even stream until 15 or 16, and education is provided by a mix of national and local government. The result is a stable public service, capable of far greater innovation than our own fragmented school market.Expert organisations and iniduals are already considering ways to unpick the semi-privatisation of our schools. These include: opening up currently unaccountable academy trusts to parents, staff and local communities shifting contracts currently held with the secretary of state to local authorities and designing a bespoke mechanism by which schools could rejoin the local education authority.But there’s an even bigger job for the progressive left, and that is to kickstart an honest public debate about what’s really wrong with English education and how we might develop a better, fairer model. Such a conversation would have to break with the current cross-party consensus – in reality, a stubborn silence – on the relationship between selective and private schools and the often beleaguered state system. Let’s ditch, once and for all, the idea that the selective schools are an inspiring model for – rather than a major block to – high-quality public education, and start to talk seriously about how to create a common system.As Alex Beard argues in his recent book Natural Born Learners: Our Incredible Capacity to Learn and How We Can Harness it, developments in everything from artificial intelligence to neuroscience seriously challenge once rigid ideas of ability and potential – excellence only for the few. He reports on a rainbow of experiments, from improbably fun-sounding Finnish maths lessons to Californian high schools deploying “open source” learning and teamwork, that are producing skilled, enthusiastic students and responsible, questioning citizens. Beard consistently identifies a highly trained, highly valued, autonomous teaching force – another area in which the English system has, with depressing predictability, gone into reverse, truncating teacher education and controlling teachers more tightly than badly behaved teens.It doesn’t have to be this way. With generous investment, expert teachers and heads given room to breathe, a broad but stimulating curriculum, an accountability system that supports rather than punishes, we could move in a more engaging direction. Much of the ground work has already been laid, from early comprehensive reform to the dramatic improvements to London’s schools in the 00s, through to the recent conversion of large parts of the Tory party to the benefits of high-quality comprehensive schools.Any future government committed to such an aim needs to engage the energies of the thousands of passionate young educators, first drawn in by the academy and free school movement, as well as the mass of weary professionals in their middle years. We don’t need silent corridors or an obsession with league tables to make clear that schools must always be places of order, collaboration, high expectations and constant encouragement – and vital hubs for local communities.I don’t underestimate what a shift in substance and tone these proposals represent for the Labour party. But as Beard suggests, quoting the genius of West Wing scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin, “We don’t need little changes we need gigantic, monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. Competition for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be making six-figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge to its citizens.” Not a bad place to start when building a national education service for the 21st century.• Melissa Benn is the author of Life Lessons: the Case for a National Education Service, to be published in September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2faac6d05b8d993e70e71b741b49ae3d579065c7/0_1082_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69286e90595a5e6739303388a3490ab5","title":"every bald man needs a great hat so i went in search of stylish options","story":"The fedora and the trilby are out of fashion, and a baseball cap can feel immature. So what can Sam Wolfson, a man nearing 30, wear to keep the sun off his head?In 2011, Banana Republic launched an official “Mad Men” range aimed at customers nostalgic for a more stylish time when they could drink so much before 2pm that they needed a nap. The centrepiece were those classic Don Draper hats: feathered fedoras and crumpled trilbies you could doff to your lift attendant. There was even a straw fedora, perfect for disappearing to Los Angeles for two weeks without telling the wife or kids where you were.The range was a huge success, selling out completely, and the company’s annual reports started to sing about rising revenues. Banana Republic released new Mad Men collections for the following three years. But, today, its UK website has only a single hat for men – a wool felt baseball cap.Indeed, it now seems as if the Mad Men fetishisation was the final hurrah for the man’s formal hat. An item that, a century ago, was as essential as trousers and shirts is close to death. It has entered a fashion black hole. Male celebrities have almost entirely stopped wearing hats, and those who still do really shouldn’t. Johnny Depp looks as if he is about to compere a slam poetry night in Tunbridge Wells, while Olly Murs looks as if he has been trapped in a children’s cartoon.Summer is the perfect time to shelter under something large and floppy, but when I went into 10 major menswear stores at a Westfield shopping centre, in London this week – not one sold any hats apart from very casual iterations: caps, beanies and bucket hats. (Topman had a baker boy hat, somewhere between a flat cap and a Kangol beret, but it makes you look as if you are about to serve up school dinners.) Looking ahead to autumnwinter, it is the same story at trendsetting brands such as YMC, Ami and APC, which don’t have any non-casual hats as part of the new season’s ranges.Caps and bucket hats have dominated Lanvin and Christopher Raeburn catwalks recently – and they were certainly on display everywhere in Westfield. The bucket hat re-emerged a few years ago on the hyper-stylish Swedish rap scene called cloud boys, after being sported by the scene’s leading light, Yung Lean. His fashion-conscious fans all began wearing bucket hats and the look spread to US rap, before becoming available at Urban Outfitters.But like so much of the current vogue for 90s sportswear, while the bucket is cool, it looks ridiculous on anyone over 21. You can probably get away with caps and beanies until you are 30, but after that you look like an undercover cop trying to bust secondary school drug dealers. So what are you supposed to do after that? Are hats out of the question?This is a particularly important question for me because, as a bald man, hats are not just an accessory but a necessity. In the sunshine, my head sweats and peels. In the cold, each gust of wind feels like a dementor frenching my scalp. I’m 28, so on the verge of no longer being able to wear baseball caps and beanies. I would love to graduate to a smarter hat, but every time I try one on – for a wedding, for example – I feel like the sort of person who takes a guitar to the beach.I speak to a couple of fashion experts who agree that formal hats conjure up unpleasant associations. Daryoush Haj-Najafi, a menswear writer and lecturer, says trilbies make him think of “Bacardi adverts”. Estefania Hageman, a stylist for menswear magazines, says the cap’s rise and the formal hat’s decline is part of a wider shift towards street culture. Skate brands such as Palace and Supreme dominate, while rappers such as Travis Scott and A$AP Rocky have become fashion icons. “We’re living in a moment that’s pure domination by hip-hop,” says Haj-Najafi. “The baseball cap is a New York item – hip-hop is from New York.”Virgil Abloh is a leading light in men’s fashion who started outside the fashion world, working with hip-hop artists such as Kanye West and Skepta, designing tracksuits and trucker hats. In six years, he has gone from Chicago DJ to the creative director of Louis Vuitton. “He’s taken items like the tracksuit and baseball cap and made them high end and desirable,” says Haj-Najafi. Now even CEOs are wearing baseball caps – it’s the everyman look.” Essentially, men’s fashion now is about a lack of formality and caps fit into that, but trilbies don’t. A hundred years ago, a hat was essential everyday wear for men, rich or poor. Photographs of football matches in the 1930s show every supporter wearing a hat. As styles became more relaxed after the war, hats fell out of favour for everyday, but were still a mainstay of fashion and celebrity – Michael Jackson’s black fedora, the Thin White Duke’s wide-rimmed boater, the ska scene’s adoption of the pork pie and the Notorious BIG’s Kangol 504 flat caps and berets. Even late in the early 00s, tween pop stars such as Justin Timberlake wore ridiculous hats as part of their effervescent sex appeal.So, how were formal hats turned from an absolute necessity to an eyesore? Much of the blame has to be pinned on two men: Pete Doherty and Neil Strauss. Strauss is the author of The Game, a book that reports on and proselytises for the pick-up-community. Pick-up artists believe men can learn techniques that will make any woman sleep with them. One such technique is “peacocking” – wearing a few items of garish clothing to get you noticed and give you something to talk about. Hats were a big part of this, and became emblematic of a certain kind of sleazy nightclub-botherer – someone who would affectedly drink whiskey sours and lightly gesture toward the groin in the belief that they were subconsciously making women think about sex.At the same time, the hat was having a real resurgence on the indie rock scene. Doherty led a small battalion, with Alex Zane, Peanut from Kaiser Chiefs and assorted members of the Australian band Jet bringing up the rear. Hedi Slimane, then the head of Dior Homme, was obsessed with Doherty and, together, the two men reimagined the male silhouette as something svelte, in tight jeans and a leather jacket, with a big protruding hat on top.Over time, places such as Camden in London and the Northern Quarter in Manchester became overrun with men leering about in a trilby. That’s how the hat has become unchic: 10 years ago, it recalled a time of Madison Avenue manliness or troubadourish artistry. Now, it recalls a time when lads at V Festival with fags hanging out of their mouths were shouting: “Imogen, babes, don’t storm off like that!”It wouldn’t be so bad if caps and beanies were a reasonable replacement. But most beanies look ridiculous (especially in summer) either too large or too small. Baseball caps are structured awfully, with big jutting rims that make you look like a train driver. I have a few that I love, including one from Weekday that I have bought three times and lost three times already, but it’s not easy.Still, there are some nascent signs that the baseball cap might be entering a stylish new phase. Arket has light seersucker versions, which its head of menswear tells me “compliment our idea of the everyday uniform” by focusing on “soft and natural materials”. You can see what he means - it’s a cap you could imagine wearing to a posh lunch. Cos and Topman are already stocking brimless versions – and there is a kind of workmanlike smartness to them, the sort of thing you could wear into your mid-40s and get away with.Dior Homme’s spring collection for next year, which is inspired by formal wear, includes extremely smart baseball caps with ornamental buckles. The trilby, the fedora, the pork pie: there is no hope for these hats unless you want to repel your friends and lovers. But perhaps the smart hat’s return could come through the backdoor left open by sportswear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7389c4fcc178c2e92f6a3894f4f20c8fa9177f6e/0_130_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec83bac35c49016dd964c82f61ff7bd2","title":"skate kitchen review crystal moselle the wolfpack","story":"Crystal Moselle’s narrative follow-up to acclaimed documentary The Wolfpack is a mostly naturalistic and atmospheric tale of skateboarders in New YorkCrystal Moselle’s new film Skate Kitchen opens on Long Island teen Camille (Rachelle Vinberg) as she carves up a Lower East Side park on her board. She’s weightless, carefree, in her element – until she wipes out, and hard. She sustains a particularly intimate injury known as getting “credit carded” (give it a moment’s thought), and starts to bleed profusely from between her legs. The symbolism gets right up in the viewer’s face: skating is pain, and pain makes women out of girls.That’s pretty much the mission statement of Skate Kitchen, both the movie and the real-life all-female crew from which it got its title and cast. Moselle has set what would otherwise be a pat coming-of-age story apart from its peers by placing it within an unexplored corner of New York’s downtown skate rat culture, where the punk nihilism of the 90s has been replaced by a spiky feminist ethic. The kids of Kids are out of the picture here, replaced by a girl gang that frankly discusses menstruation and the definition of “gaslighting” when they’re not videotaping each other doing ollies. Moselle last peered into an insular Big Apple bubble with her documentary The Wolfpack, and while she straddles the iding line between fiction and non-fiction this time around, her aim to shed light on an unacknowledged underground remains the same. She happened upon the Skate Kitchen’s exploits through Instagram’s Discover feature, and thanks to her, we don’t have to.Though Camille’s passion makes for an unlikely pairing with her gender, the rest of her life roughly resembles that of any other city kid. She likes testing the boundaries set by her tough-love mother (Elizabeth Rodriguez), sneaking out and courting danger as youths are wont to do. She’s formulating a sexual identity, secure enough to firmly answer a friend needling her about her preferences in genitals and yet not quite secure enough to act on it. She’s not all that into drugs, but not ironclad about it either. Vinberg makes for a fine lump of un-molded clay, her in-progress air reinforced by the filler syllables and mumbles of a nonprofessional actor. Like everyone else going through the high school years, she’s figuring herself out, and the Skate Kitchen clique offers her an identity she gladly accepts.Moselle is at her most astute when concentrating on the fragile social dynamics that govern the tribes adolescents ide themselves into for survival’s sake. The feeling of belonging can be a potent narcotic, and Camille gets an intoxicating hit of it the first time one of her heroes speaks to her like a peer. There’s strength in numbers, and Camille feels like she owns the street when she’s gliding through the city causing junior-league havoc with her friends. The Perks of Being a Wallflower described this sensation as feeling “infinite” Camille might use similar language, tacking a “bro” onto the sentence. Just as one false step can turn a 360 into a skinned knee, it only takes one faux pas to get a new member cast out just as quickly as they joined. Camille runs afoul of one of her new comrades in developing a crush on her ex (a dye-headed Jaden Smith), granting the film a semblance of conflict it doesn’t really need. Keen viewers can perceive the invisible hand of narrative pushing them together despite their lack of chemistry, and the resultant drama feels contrived in comparison to the comfortable naturalism between the girls. Likewise, Camille’s combative relationship with her mother sticks out as a writerly construct, forcing the usual indie drama arc structure onto a subject that thrives when just chillin’. Skate Kitchen falters whenever it starts to act like a movie instead of the observational slice of life that Moselle’s so adept at capturing.But for the most part, she sticks to the good stuff, filling out her run time with montage after montage of magic hour footage following the skaters through their natural habitat. The soundtrack repeating “young, dumb and broke” like a mantra lays bare the appeal of Camille’s adopted lifestyle: no worries, no responsibilities and no trifling boys to come between them. It’s an appealing prospect for any teenager, and in one fleeting shot trained on a wide-eyed child watching the Skate Kitchen crew fly by, the film dares to suggest its own power to inspire the young women who watch it. Call it presumptuous (it is), but the aspirational spirit behind that choice is sound enough. This is an evolved girlhood, where femininity can mean whatever and solidarity matters over all else. The ease with which Camille joins her makeshift family is the most inviting aspect of all, a come-as-you-are attitude tacitly extended to anyone who buys a board directly after leaving the theater. All women are welcome the only price of admission to their world is the ability to kickflip."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61067400914ee45eadbddb3253836e1dcdb9f920/0_0_5078_3047/master/5078.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c9c42b9f625618520a9f694ebadf7a3","title":"chelsea kepa arrizabalaga athletic bilbao transfer","story":"Kepa Arrizabalaga became the world’s most expensive goalkeeper on Wednesday after completing a £71.6m move from Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, with the young Spain international signing a seven-year contract to replace Thibaut Courtois at Stamford Bridge.Kepa will be joined by the Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic after he was secured on loan from Real Madrid. The fee for Kepa eclipses the previous record for a goalkeeper of £66.9m, paid by Liverpool to Roma for Brazil’s No\u0026nbsp1, Alisson, last month and the Spaniard could make his debut in Saturday’s opening Premier League fixture at Huddersfield. Real, who will unveil Courtois on Thursday afternoon, had been close to securing the one-time Spain international for £17.9m seven months ago.“It’s a very important decision for me, for my career, and also for my personal life,” Kepa said. “So many things attracted me to the club, all the titles the club has won, the other players, the city, the English Premier League. It’s an accumulation of things, and I am very glad Chelsea has decided to trust me and to take me in as well.”Lawyers for Chelsea and Kepa had convened at the offices of La Liga in Madrid on Wednesday morning and deposited the fee to trigger the release clause in the 23-year-old’s contract. The goalkeeper, capped once but a regular in Spain’s junior set-up, subsequently flew to London. “Kepa is a talent we have admired for a long time and we are extremely excited about his arrival,” said the Chelsea director, Marina Granovskaia. “He has already demonstrated fantastic quality and consistency and will be a big part of any success Chelsea have in the coming years. His long-term contract reflects the belief we have in him and we look ahead to the coming seasons with an enormous sense of optimism.”Kovacic, who made 10 starts in La Liga last term, has joined for the season much to the dismay of the new Real head coach, Julen Lopetegui, as part of the deal that took Courtois to the Bernabéu. The Belgian goalkeeper, absent without leave all week, will be presented as a Madrid player, costing £35m, on Thursday after a medical.He could be one of numerous departures, with Tiemoué Bakayoko’s brother and agent having spent Wednesday in Italy speaking with the Milan directors Leonardo and Paolo Maldini. Bakayoko, a £40m signing from Monaco, is likely to leave on a 12-month loan that could include an option to buy. Premier League clubs had been quoted £15m to sign the France international for the season.That deal, together with Valencia’s offer to take Michy Batshuayi on loan, can be completed before the end of the month. More pressing are the futures of Danny Drinkwater and Kurt Zouma, who have attracted interest from Premier League sides. Everton have enquired about taking Zouma on loan for the season while Drinkwater is available for around £37m, but prospective suitors have been quoted a £10m loan fee, plus his wages. Tomas Kalas is expected to move to Middlesbrough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6901361a7be4f4d1c800ea035a4cbf355580c6af/107_0_4339_2604/master/4339.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=336c49d8214d691d8ac79b324b636da8","title":"fans 20 premier league clubs transfer requests","story":"Manchester United need a defender, Southampton want a striker and Newcastle should swap Ashley for StaveleyJamaal Lascelles looks perfect as a long-term replacement for Laurent Koscielny. The Newcastle player would strengthen our defence and could be a future captain. If not him, Domagoj Vida will do – but not at £25m. Basically, we should sign any centre-back who will ensure that Shkodran Mustafi no longer sees the starting XI. We should sell Joel Campbell. Fraser KnoxChris Mepham, a 20-year-old Wales international, has been on Eddie Howe’s radar for a while now and I’m hopeful we can sign him before the deadline. Mepham seems comfortable with the ball at his feet and is able to play it from the back, which is a must for our style of play. Playing with three central defenders means we need good coverage, and I’m hopeful he will eventually replace the ageing Simon Francis. Although £15m seems excessive for his current experience, there is plenty of room for him to grow. It’s probably time to sell Harry Arter. He is a true legend at Bournemouth who had a great debut Premier League season, but he now seems behind Dan Gosling and Andrew Surman in the pecking order, and the arrival of Jefferson Lerma and David Brooks only lessens his opportunities. It would be good to cash in while we can, although if he goes in Cardiff we need a clause to stop him playing us in the season opener. Jack Clarke-WilliamsWe find ourselves slightly short of cover at centre-back, having lost both Connor Goldson and Uwe Huenemeier over the summer. Leon Balogun looks like an able replacement but an injury to him, Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy will leave us short in the position, so it is important to bring in another centre-back. Liam Moore was the standout player for Reading last season and looks like he could be capable of providing more than cover. Oh, and he’s handed in a transfer request, which helps.We need to sign Jay Rodriguez from West Brom and another midfield player – we really would need two new players. We should sell Jeff Hendrick, who doesn’t really add anything when he comes on. MeganIf we’re playing “Sarri-ball” we need passers, which is why the Mateo Kovacic talk is welcome. A midfield comprised of three from N’Golo Kanté, Jorginho. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Ross Barkley and Kovacic should be a match for most. We also need a striker who can score a goal or two, but the board have left it far too late (again) and anyone brought in will be done in an unedifying scramble. We should sell Danny Drinkwater and Tiémoué Bakayoko. Lucas PollardWe should buy Maximilian Philipp from Borussia Dortmund. He is a versatile striker with a lot of pace and technical skills who would combine well with Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend. Nico SzmolinskyAre we really going to go into this season with Phil Jagielka as our best centre-back? Please, please let us sign Yerry Mina and give our ageing defence an injection of youth. With him and Lucas Digne, we’ll have the beginnings of a tiki-taka revolution. We should sell Yannick Bolasie. MattConsidering how great the partnership on the left flank between Matt Targett and Ryan Sessegnon was in the second half of the season, bringing Targett back would be the ideal final signing. In our last friendly we played Sessegnon at left-back, where he is perfectly capable, but it would be better to see him further up the field where he has been making a name for himself and winning awards. ChrisWe should bring in Danny Ings and sell Scott Malone.We need a proven winger to replace some of the flair and goals Riyad Mahrez gave us. Thorgan Hazard is continually discussed on forums. Demarai Gray and Fousseni Diabaté are so inconsistent, so someone who could provide 10 goals and 10 assists would be huge. We could also do with another centre-back who could provide cover for the first team, or better yet, improve it. Depending on who comes in, the club could potentially cash in on Harry Maguire, who seems to have increased his price by £30m by playing against some rank average teams at the World Cup. If the club could get Lascelles or one of the Manchester United defenders not fancied by Joseé Mourinho, they should seriously consider cashing in on a player who will never be worth this much again. We still have a bloated squad so Islam Slimani, Leonardo Ulloa, Matty James, Andy King, Nampalys Mendy could be moved on. JacobWe should sign Nabil Fekir, can unlock defences the way Philippe Coutinho did. Naby Keïta is dynamic, Fabinho is powerful and both Jordan Henderson and James Milner are hard-working, but Fekir would add the vision, guile and finesse Liverpool will need when they come up against teams that sit deep and defend. He also scores plenty of goals, which would make him an option up top should any of the front three need a rest. If we don’t sign him, Chelsea or United will. In terms of who we should sell, this may be controversial, but the self-proclaimed “best defender in the world” would be the first to go on my list. Despite Dejan Lovren’s decent World Cup performance and his newfound consistency when played alongside Van Dijk at Liverpool, he represents the Liverpool of the past few years: just short of the standard required and always capable of a calamity. If we are serious about pursuing a title, this is the time to be ruthless. Naji BakhtiWe have needed back-up at defensive midfield for a couple of years, even more so now Fernandinho is 33 and Jorginho has jumped ship to Chelsea at the last minute. Fernandinho is still an absolute rock, but he can’t play all the big games this season and we need somebody young and agile. We’ve been linked to Marco Verratti, Mateo Kovacic and Julian Weigl all summer. I’m not too worried though, because some of the youngsters have really impressed in that position in pre-season and Pep Guardiola says Ilkay Gundogan and Fabian Delph could also fill in. I fully trust his decisions. We shouldn’t sell anyone. Shiven MianWithout a doubt, we should sign Toby Alderweireld. Harry Maguire would be a fantastic addition after making the step up to Leicester last season but I’d need to see what he’s like in his second season before justifying spending £65m on a defender who’s had one good campaign. We should move on Matteo Darmian, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo (if Alderweireld joins). Eric JayWe need to sign Amanda Staveley and sell Mike Ashley. Nick AmannWe should sign Paco Alcácer. Whatever it takes, we need a goalscorer. I’d sell Fraser Forster. Will PurdueSince selling Gareth Bale, Spurs haven’t had a player who can run with the ball for long distances and then beat a player in the final third. Son Heung-min is of that type but he is too inconsistent and often makes poor decisions in big games, so I would love to see Wilfred Zaha in a Spurs shirt. He has the physical attributes Pochettino values he seems to have matured since rejoining Palace and he would offer something different to the players we have. We should get rid of Danny Rose. If he doesn’t want to play for Spurs, just sell him and be done with it. James Berry Priority No1 is a striker and Paco Alcácer ticks all the boxes. His numbers have been great for both Valencia and Barça. It would also be a huge coup for the club, much like when we signed Roberto Pereyra from Juventus. Alcácer could make a huge difference if we are to push for the dizzying heights of seventh place in the Premier League, or even an exciting cup run. In terms of moving players on, I’d take £10m for Troy Deeney and I still don’t know why we need three left-backs. José Holebas or Marvin Zeegelaar are welcome to leave. RussellWe need a holding midfielder. One of Danny Drinkwater, Maxime Gonalons or Thiago Maia would do. And we should sell Edimilson Fernandes. JohannesIf the mooted deal for Leander Dendoncker goes through, it will be a perfect signing for us. Now that Alfred N’Diaye’s loan deal has ended and Romain Saiss seems to be playing in defence, we are lacking the required midfield muscle to support Rúben Neves or João Moutinho as they pull the strings. Other than that, a cheeky late bid for Milan striker André Silva would go down well with Wolves fans! We should sell Danny Batth sadly our club captain is not up to the challenge.

The Manchester United manager is veering on inconsolable, deeply concerned at the lack of incomings and, unless Ed Woodward can pull a few rabbits out of the hat, the Portuguese could slump into his biggest and gloomiest huff yet. United are still keen on adding a defender, and Harry Maguire has his heart set on a move to Old Trafford but, after already swallowing two bids, Leicester City are refusing to even pick up the phone. Jérôme Boateng has turned his nose up at a move, favouring a £40.5m permanent switch to Paris Saint-Germain instead, while Toby Alderweireld is another face Mourinho longs to see waltz into Carrington.Down at Arsenal there is little panic at all, though they are considering a late move for the ponytailed Croatia defender Domagoj Vida, with Besiktas happy to flog him for around £26m. Unai Emery knows Stan Kroenke’s cash could be better spent, and fancies a loan move for Ousmane Dembélé, Barcelona’s World Cup winner, until May. Reports in Spain suggest an initial £10m loan fee could lure the Catalan club into getting the deal done, followed by a £90m transfer, if all went swimmingly. Across north London Tottenham have not given up hope of landing Jack Grealish but have plenty of work to do if they are to convince Aston Villa’s stubborn owners into giving any move the green light, having already rejected a £25m bid. At Chelsea there could be a deadline-day move for Danny Drinkwater, with West Ham and Crystal Palace, plus his old club Leicester, sniffing around.The Wolves revolution continues and that’s before they’ve got their hands on Layvin Kurzawa and Oleksandr Zinchenko. Everton are also on the hunt for a new left-back, as Marco Silva looks set to complete half a Barcelona XI, with André Gomes and Yerry Mina on his longlist after snapping up Lucas Digne, while Kurt Zouma, the towering France defender, is another option. Elsewhere Islam Slimani could be heading to any one of Fenerbahce, Besiktas or his former employers Sporting Lisbon, providing Leicester pick up £18m for their man and after moving on to bigger and better things, Brighton are happy to cash in on 2016-17’s Tomer Hemed, with the Israeli striker primed for a move to QPR.And, this is cruel: at the 11th hour, Villa have been upstaged by Fulham. After failing to coerce Southampton into selling Matty Targett, the Premier League side made their advances on Joe Bryan, snatching the Bristol City defender from under the nose of Steve Bruce late on Wednesday night. Bryan, also the subject of interest from Newcastle, had already agreed a medical and personal terms at Villa but is set to complete a £5m deadline-day move to Fulham, and a spiffing window for Slavisa Jokanovic’s side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f0085915876cf7b6775c8761068e4bf8c4a90f9/0_124_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edfe128bfa242fae8e4d83529370af15","title":"tottenham hotspur premier league preview","story":" writers’ predicted position: 4th (NB: this is not necessarily Nick Ames’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 14-1The cranes, each one smartly painted in the club’s colours and displaying a flag of the famous cockerel crest, still soar above the N17 skyline nearby cafes, readying themselves for the thrum of match day once again, are kept busy in the meantime by the hundreds of construction workers rushing against deadline. By 15 September everything will be more or less ready and Tottenham, back from their exile around the North Circular Road, will begin their new era in London’s biggest club stadium with a lunchtime fixture against Liverpool.That will, inescapably, frame whatever Mauricio Pochettino and his squad achieve in the next nine months. They need only to glance over at Arsenal for an object lesson in how moving to a new ground can arrest a team’s development it will be some time, as Pochettino acknowledges, before millions of pounds rain from the sky but at least they know what they are getting into on the pitch.After a stodgy goalless draw with Swansea last September brought up three league games without a win at Wembley, the manager suggested talk of a rocky acclimatisation risked self-fulfilling and that Spurs needed to “move on”. They dropped only seven more home points all season familiarity was, in the end, barely an issue for a highly accomplished cadre of footballers that is used to simply turning up and doing the job.On the surface there is little reason to suggest the same should not be true upon their latest move. Yet Tottenham do run the risk of another slow start this time around, even if some of the reasons differ. The fact nine of their players were involved in the World Cup through to the final weekend speaks glowingly of the quality Pochettino has amassed it also presents a short-term problem given that they only returned to training on Monday, meaning the likes of Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Kieran Trippier, Jan Vertonghen and Hugo Lloris will need careful assessment before decisions are taken about their involvement at Newcastle on Saturday.They should be ready before long but it would have helped if, by now, Tottenham had been able to bed in some reinforcements. Pochettino believes new signings take six or seven months to adapt it is a warning he has sounded before, and if Daniel Levy is banking on the floodgates opening in the final hours of a clogged-up transfer window then he is certainly taking past levels of brinkmanship up several notches.Tottenham’s squad – rather than an already outstanding set of first-choice selections – needs to be better if they are to build on a third successive finish inside the top three. Pochettino has struggled to find players who can straddle the line between backup and credible starter for a top-four team it was therefore encouraging to see Jack Grealish, who has the potential to shoulder some of Christian Eriksen’s creative burden, in his sights although the noises from Aston Villa are that no deal will be entertained.Anything else probably hinges on receiving last-minute funds for Toby Alderweireld, Victor Wanyama or Mousa Dembélé all three had been expected to leave during the summer. These are necessarily straitened times but Pochettino may not find it easy to toe the line. “Now, we are going to try again to do things early,” he saidin December of his expectations for this window. “If we cannot again, I am going to say: ‘Come on, we could not again.’”If Spurs find themselves obliged to proceed with their existing tools there is the consolation that the most important parts are going nowhere. Pochettino and Kane had been linked to Real Madrid but signed new long-term contracts before the World Cup. With these two in place any season should seem alive with possibility.There is certainly little to fault in a front four of Kane, Alli, Eriksen and Son Heung-min. The South Korean will miss much of the first month due to the Asian Games but Tottenham are relatively well covered in wide areas with Erik Lamela and Lucas Moura, who scored twice in a 4-1 pre-season win over Roma and looks set to impress in his first full campaign.The elephant in the room, as ever, is what happens if anything befalls Kane. Son has the quality to operate as a false nine, as he did a few times last season, but it is no long-term solution. For all that Tottenham have developed collectively under Pochettino, Kane’s 30 league goals in 2017-18 were his highest proportion yet of the team’s total – a quality alternative is badly needed.If the midfield needs freshening up then Luke Amos, a 21-year-old who was barely on the radar before a series of excellent performances in the International Champions Cup, may be given his chance. There is hope, too, that Harry Winks will be available soon having recovered from ankle surgery. Two years after his first-team breakthrough it is still hard to tell quite how good Winks, a very tidy, technical player, actually is but there would be a clear opportunity to assert himself in an area where Spurs’ options are, again, hardly endless.The rapid strides made by both Trippier and Ben Davies, considered back-ups two seasons ago, are a tribute to Pochettino’s player development, and the defence should get by unless there is any dramatic late change in Alderweireld’s situation. Cameron Carter-Vickers, another to impress recently, may stay put as an extra centre-back.Early meetings with Manchester United and, on that red-letter day in north London, Liverpool will provide important indications of how well-placed Tottenham are to push on with the current crop. There will be intrigue and perhaps concern as to how quickly Jürgen Klopp’s reinforced side, who finished only two points adrift of Spurs in 2017-18, settle down as well as the adeptness with which Unai Emery and Maurizio Sarri recalibrate their new teams elsewhere in the city.In an ideal world it may be enough to chalk this season off as one in which a fourth consecutive Champions League qualification would suffice. That no longer cuts it, though, and Pochettino was not only speaking for himself when he said that “for me, it is not enough” simply to sit at Europe’s top table.The clear implication is that the time has come, in his fifth season, to win a major trophy. Bridging the gap with Manchester Cityby any significant amount looks a long shot on the continent they have beaten the best only to be outsmarted by Juventus, and the easiest way to satisfy Pochettino’s urge may be to banish the ghosts of that crushing FA Cup semi-final defeat to Manchester United. Otherwise they may have to content themselves with the strange feeling of treading water at a rarefied level, roared on from their gleaming new stands and waiting a little longer for the day when, like those navy-blue-and-white cranes, they get to tower above everyone else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3083c4e8ceaa0d39a2bd1230a9d84b520dc3aad/0_1844_3792_2275/master/3792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93d31f0e82557d89a55122d4c329bb65","title":"wearing boxer shorts boosts sperm count scientists say","story":"Men who want to boost their sperm counts may want to swap their tight-fitting underpants for more roomy boxers which are better suited to keeping testicles cool, scientists say.A major study into the impact of underwear on sperm quality found that men who favoured airy boxer shorts made significantly more sperm than those who tucked themselves into more restrictive items of underwear.“The results from this study are very practical,” said Lidia Mínguez-Alarcón who worked on the study at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health in Boston. “Men could improve their sperm production by easily changing their type of underwear.”The report builds on three decades of research that have sought to tackle the question of whether a man’s choice of underwear has an impact on how well his testes function. There is now a fair consensus that tight underpants may lead to “scrotal heating” which harms the Sertoli cells that make sperm in the testes.While the present study did not investigate the temperature of men’s testicles, the importance of keeping the male gonads cool has been apparent since at least the 1920s. Scientists now know that the best conditions for sperm production occur in free-dangling testes that are 3 to 4C cooler than the normal body temperature of 37C.“It has been shown that high scrotal temperatures alter spermatogenesis,” said Mínguez-Alarcón, referring to the 90-day job that is sperm manufacture. “Men wearing tighter underwear may have higher scrotal temperatures compared to men wearing looser underwear.”Writing in the journal Human Reproduction, the US researchers describe how they quizzed the male partners of couples seeking fertility treatment about their preferred choice of underwear. More than half, or 345 men, said they mostly wore boxer shorts, with 311 men favouring more snug items of underwear.After accounting for variations in physical activity, body mass index, smoking and whether or not the men enjoyed jacuzzis or hot baths – all of which affect sperm – the scientists found consistent differences in semen samples taken from the men. Those who favoured boxer shorts had on average 64.7m sperm per millilitre and 168m sperm per ejaculate. The figures compared to an average of 51.9m sperm per millilitre and 138m sperm per ejaculate among men who sported closer-fitting underwear.While the differences are marked, none of the men in the study can be considered to have a clinically low sperm counts, for which the cut-off is 15m sperm per millilitre and 39m per ejaculate. So while tight pants may reduce sperm counts, it is unlikely they would make a healthy man infertile.The study does not prove that tight underwear causes sperm counts to fall. And because the men were asked to recall their usual underwear choice, rather than having the information recorded day by day, there is room for error in the results. Furthermore, all of the men were in couples seeking fertility treatment, so it is unclear whether the findings reflect what would be seen in healthy men in the wider population. Other factors could also matter, such as how long men spend sitting down each day.Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at Sheffield University, has published two large studies on the factors that affect sperm quality and found similar links to tight underwear. He said UK guidelines drawn up by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) in 2004 are still sound. They recommend that men seeking fertility treatment are told about the link between scrotal temperature and reduced semen quality, but are warned that it is unclear whether underwear choice actually affects fertility.Prof Lee Smith, who studies testicular function at the University of Newcastle in Australia, said: “This is an interesting study further highlighting the links between raised scrotal temperature and an increased risk of slightly reducing sperm count, however the study is a correlation based on a self-reporting survey and additional research is required to unequivocally identify a causal link.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757c6676512c8dee9e0c4a726df6a60d2cf99d44/0_75_2384_1430/master/2384.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f424286423759bc9898fc7205fa00969","title":"stefania rousselle photographer love","story":"Photojournalist and videographer Stefania Rousselle asked strangers to share their most defining and life-changing love storiesAfter covering a series of bleak assignments – terrorist attacks in Paris, the rise of the European extreme right, sex slavery in Spain – the French-American photojournalist and videographer Stefania Rousselle was mired in pessimism and despair. “My heart was broken,” she said. “I didn’t believe in love anymore.”In 2017, to find joy once more, she decided to go on a road trip across France, asking random strangers to share their most defining and life-changing love stories with her. She posts them to her Instagram. Here are a few of the best ones.Yann: “Alexandre and I met on Facebook through friends. We then talked on Skype for two months and we fell in love. Alexandre was kicked out of his house and he came to live with me and my family. My parents were not aware that we were in love or that I was gay. But my mother guessed it, because we were looking at each other lovingly. One day she searched my room and found all the letters we wrote each other. In my family, we don’t speak about our feelings. She had a hard time accepting it. The day she gave me her blessing, I immediately asked Alexandre to marry me. We got married two weeks ago. We are the second gay couple to get married in Elbeuf!” Alexandre: “I decided to take Yann’s last name. I am completely estranged from my family except for my father, but he died in April. I was brought up in a foster family who I’ve since taken to court for mistreatment. And when I finally went back to my mother’s house, she ended up throwing me out because I was gay. Today, I am at peace. With Yann, I feel confident. I love Yann’s body and his childish side. I am always doing little things for him, like every night, I pour him a bath with candles, and I bring him breakfast in bed. We want at least four children.”“At the time, there was no mixed couple in Dunkirk. One day, we even got arrested by the police because he is black. My mother rejected me and wanted to send me to a correctional facility. So I left home with nothing, just my purse. And when we wanted to get married, the first priest we asked refused, saying black people were like cockroaches. We’ve loved each other for 53 years. And people now fight to get into the Caribbean nights we organize!”“I was Jeanne’s neighbor. I lived right there, the fifth house on the right. When her husband died, I offered to help her mow her lawn. I was married with children and she had a little girl. I would address her in the formal form, ‘vous’. Nothing happened for 10 years. One day, I declared my love. And it happened. I left my house. Even after we had slept in the same bed for a month, I was still calling her ‘Madame Dufeutrel’. She died two months ago. She was the love of my life. In the morning, we would listen to the radio and dance together in the kitchen. I go to the cemetery every day to talk to her.”“He had the reputation of being a great charmer. All the girls wanted him. He would always go out with end-of-the-line duchesses, or dancers with long legs. I, on the other hand, was a tiny girl with no money. He made accessories for a circus company, and I was an equestrian performer. I would go naked on the horse’s back, stand on it, or ride sidesaddled. I fell in love with him because I wanted security. But it turned out to be the opposite: he harassed me mentally and physically, and denigrated me as an artist. I directed comedians and acrobats, but he would go behind my back to tell them my artistic direction was all wrong. He would break everything I did. “I started telling people what was going on, and no one helped me. They would say: ‘But you have such a strong character.’ We stayed together for 17 years until one day, he tried to strangle me with the canvas I was working on and throw me out the window. I left him. “What he did was about having power over my role as a woman and as an artist – but never as a mother, which is strange. Our son understood everything that was going on he was the one that would bring me a glass of water after my husband would choke me. “I think I’m an inveterate romantic. I could fall in love so easily. I would love to raise a second child. I have been given the green light to adopt one.”“I always have been very well-behaved and really good at school. I am an only child. I was always a loner and concentrated on my studies. No boys, no friends. Just my studies. “I went to the village fair. There, I saw a man leaning at the bar, drinking a beer. He was classy he was beautiful he had style. We talked for hours. I wanted to see him again. I found out where he lived and went to see him. We fell madly in love. I was 17. He was 55. “The problem when you are 17 and that you fall in love with an older man is that you ask yourself: do I have a psychological problem? Do I have an oedipal complex? “I had no experience. He was my first love. Months became years. “We kept our relationship secret. When I was off at university and he came to pick me up at the train station, I would hide in the trunk of his car so that nobody would see us. Until one day, I was walking hand in hand with Jean-Pierre in a nearby town, and I bumped into my father. My father said: ‘It’s easy. It’s either him or me. If it’s him, you take your stuff and I don’t want to see you anymore.’ I moved in with Jean-Pierre and didn’t see my father for seven years. I am younger than Jean-Pierre’s kids, but they’ve always accepted me. “At 25, I started feeling unwell. Breast cancer. Breast removal. Chemo. It’s metastatic cancer, meaning the cancer will always be there. It will never heal. I start receiving treatment. We open a restaurant. Two years later, my bones are hurting. And there it is: bone cancer. I start another round of treatment. Ever since I turned 27, there have been ups and downs. I’ve undergone intense chemo and I am in a trial program. Last year I almost died, and I told him, if I survive, let’s get married. I did. We got married in an old washhouse. I could die at any time. But there is this phrase that I’ve told myself ever since I got sick: ‘I have lived it’ – I have lived that love. That emotion with the person you love, that butterfly feeling in your stomach, that beating heart, that feeling of going to pieces or of being so strong. If you don’t feel that, what is life worth living for?”“I lost my wife last November. Her name was Marie-Jeanne. I met her at a village ball. We didn’t live in the same town, so I would write her letters all the time so we could meet up every weekend. I would talk to her about mundane things, if I had a cold, for instance. I would write that I kissed her tenderly. She was a simple girl just like me. A girl from the countryside. We were together for 47 years. I loved her.“Marriage is like a business. I built the house. She cooked and raised the children. One of them is mentally disabled. He lives in a special center. When they told him his mother had died, he cried. “I thought that when he would come back to the house, he would look for her everywhere, open the doors, like he used to do. But he didn’t. He didn’t ask for her. He knew. “She’s buried in the cemetery down the village. I still have to put her stone marker with her name, the year she was born and died. I am also going to add a little cross. “There are moments where I really get depressed, when I am really low. Oh la la, you can’t even imagine. I miss her. She was a good cook because she was from the Landes, where there are a lot of good cooks. “In the winter, we would watch television, then sit near the fire and fall asleep in our respective chairs. We were happy. I always hoped it would last forever. It didn’t. “Please forgive me if I cry.”“I named my cabin ‘The Villa of the Ones Deprived of Love’ because I was the least favorite child in my family. It used to be that in farmers’ families, there were maybe six children. They would send the one they loved the least out into the mountains to herd sheep. And that was my case. They had very obvious preferences – especially Mom. But moms do what they can. “How do you survive that? First, you have a terrible adolescence. It was endless. I was in pain. I was shy. It was not a place for teenagers. I would come back to the village once a week, get some bread and go back to the mountain with my donkey. I would miss everything: the balls, all the activities. “But then you adapt. And I was happy. I have dedicated my whole life to the sheep. And I don’t regret it at all. “I am not mad at my parents. “I have a daughter. She is 22. Until she turned 14, it was wonderful. Then, for some reason I can’t explain, she rejected me. We haven’t spoken in 10 years. I am really disappointed. “I don’t like humans. They are twisted. When I see what they are capable of, I am ashamed. I would have rather been a dog. That is why I work with animals. And I love waking up every morning. “I am with Katia now. She is from Paris. She is a good person. I met her when she was 17 and I was 25. She was my employee. She loved me, but it wasn’t reciprocal. I was with someone else at the time. And we spent 30 years without seeing each other. But we met again and we got married 10 years ago. I never got married with the others. Why? Because they didn’t ask. She just had an operation, so she is in Paris, resting. Do I love her? I don’t know. Love is a weird word. I care about Katia. That must be love. She cares about me too – a bit too much. “She is the one I should have kept when I was young, because we could have done things together. But I was too stupid at 25. We could have had babies together. I am about to retire but there is no one to replace me. If I had had kids with Katia, one of them could have taken over and I could have retired.“I am going to have to sell my flock. I haven’t found anyone to replace me.”“I have never had any partners in my life. I have never kissed a girl. “It sucks, because I am 24. “I am not sure why. My mother was depressed – she didn’t give me any hugs, she did not like to give warmth to other people, and so I got used to it. For me, hugging people was not very normal, and I didn’t feel very comfortable with it. “I was once kissed by a girl she made the move. I liked it, but it was uncomfortable for me. I was 15 and I didn’t really know what to do. She did everything – she could have kissed a plastic object and it would have been the same. “To give a kiss is a more symbolic thing than to have sex. I’m not sure if it has anything to do with romance. It’s a mind thing. One side of me wants to have this symbolic kiss with that one person, the mother of my children. And there is the other side, the animal side, of me that says: ‘Oh I don’t give a fuck, just go into the club and fuck ’em all.’ But then I don’t do it because the first side is just stronger. I am too sensitive. “I think girls want a dominant, strong type of guy, not the sensitive guy who is too emotional, like me. I am always overthinking things. “I want to love one person. “I think I have waited for too long, now. I am afraid to fail. I have a friend of mine who I fell in love with two years ago. I was like: ‘I like you a lot,’ and she said she liked me too, but she had another boy, and she’s not a polygamist. She did not break my heart – it’s more like I broke my heart, I had big expectations and put too much pressure on myself. I wrote her a poem. I was proud of it, but I’ve never gotten the chance to give it to her. “Most of the time, I am happy. I am sad in the evenings. It’s sad to be alone it would be nice to sleep and wake up next to somebody and be like: ‘Good morning, it’s grey outside.’”“I moved from Syria to France to become a biological pharmacist and a jazz singer. I was working in a lab and this guy calls me to open the door. I will always remember how he was dressed: grey jeans, a camel leather jacket, a beautiful bag that he had bought in Poland – very stylish, very minimalist – and sneakers. For a year, I wasn’t interested, and then it just hit me. I would walk through the halls to bump into him, and I finally asked him out.“I remember our first kiss. I was sleeping at the International House and he dropped me off with his scooter. I kissed him quickly on the lips and ran away. I was thinking: ‘I did it!’ He told me he drove so fast after that. Six months later, we moved in together. “Nicolas was a brilliant man, very intelligent, too intelligent. He pushed me to sing. He would always tell me things I had forgotten about myself. He knew me so well. He loved to organize special moments for his friends. He had a truck because he was a surfer. One day, he decided to organize a cheese fondue dinner party in the truck! “He got diagnosed with cancer on 21 June 2014.“He wanted a child. I didn’t want one. It was a difficult decision, but I came to realize that if anything were to happen to him, at least I would have a memory of him in our child. “It’s the best thing we could have done. Sara was his ray of light. I am so happy he experienced being a father. “He wrote me letters. “He also wrote letters for Sara. He tells her about his life, his dreams. Profound thoughts about life. They encourage her to think about the meaning of life and encourage her not to be afraid of living – that to love is the most important thing. “Nicolas died on 11 April 2017. “Thanks to Nicolas, I am not afraid of anything. “He is a saint who came to spend some time with me. “He was my candle. “He was my guide.”“After 10 years with my ex-boyfriend, I posted on Facebook: ‘For our anniversary, we are giving each other a gift: we are separating.’ I signed up for a dating website. I met 40 men in one year. It was a great way to go out, dress up and feel pretty. “One day, Thierry contacts me. We talk on the phone at 4.30pm. At 5.35pm, we met for coffee. I was five minutes late. He came to my place the next day and he never left. “It wasn’t love at first sight with Thierry. His web profile was too perfect, and a lot of men had lied to me. He said he cooked he doesn’t. But he does do the cleaning. He tells me he loves me, that he thinks I am pretty. We can’t live without each other. It has been two years. “I want to do everything for him. All his problems are mine. I need to solve them. If I walk by him three times, I’ll kiss him at least once. I have never met a man who loves me like he does.“I will not blame him if it has to end. Because even if we only spend 10 years together, I know it will be intense and beautiful. I think life is worth it because I can give love. I don’t need to receive it. I had been married for 24 years. My ex-husband was depressed. I wanted to save him. I was so afraid to leave him because he was so sick. But I needed to go. Five years later, he committed suicide on the anniversary of our orce.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e25dd52f153d4bff187d3b309604183de493457/0_138_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99fc32a1a631628f8a0f2b0a47185005","title":"stir fried cod cheeks recipe andrei lussman","story":"Cod cheeks are slightly firmer than fillets, so perfect in a stir-fry – and the caramelised lime adds a cheffy touchThis dish is a simple stir-fry of (Marine Stewardship Council-approved) cod cheeks, spring onions, garlic and chilli with lime.

By  Alexander StilleWhen Matteo Salvini – Italy’s interior minister and the country’s most popular politician – climbed up on the stage last month at the annual meeting of his party, the Lega, he looked out on a sea of green. Many of the party members were wearing green T-shirts, and some had even dyed their hair green. Green is the colour of the flag of Padania, the independent nation, named after the Po Valley, that Salvini’s separatist party (formerly known as the Northern League) has long proposed creating to secede from the Italian state.This year, however, the message had changed. A new slogan, “Italians first!”, had replaced the old secessionist battle cries. Blue flags – the Italian national colour – mixed with the green, and Salvini stood at a blue-and-white podium in front of a blue backdrop. The enemy was no longer Rome, but Brussels, international banks and multinational corporations. This was Salvini’s doing: in four years as its leader, he has turned a movement of regional separatism into its seeming opposite, a nationalist party.As a result, the Lega’s annual meeting at Pontida – where a confederation of northern cities signed an oath in 1167 to halt the invasion of Italy by Frederick Barbarossa, the German Holy Roman Emperor – had the spirit of a victory celebration. “Four years ago on this stage,” Salvini told the crowd in early July, “you probably shared my own doubts: people thought the Lega was finished.” Instead, he continued, the party had spread its message far beyond its old northern base. “Who would have thought we would be part of a winning coalition in Molise and Sicily? That we would win in places like Siena, Viterbo, Pisa and Terni?”“While we are standing here, the third boatload of slaves in a single month is not arriving in Italy, but heading in another direction … From Pontida the warning has arrived for the human traffickers, as for the mafiosi and camorristi: the carnival is over.” La pacchia è finita (“the party is over”) is one of Salvini’s favourite phrases, and it could be found on the T-shirts of many Lega members at the Pontida rally. Attacks on migrants (and Islam, gay marriage and criminals) have taken the place of separatism in the Lega’s rhetoric. When Salvini was a young city councilman in 1999, he refused to shake hands with Italy’s then president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, saying: “No, thanks, you don’t represent me.” When Salvini was elected to the Italian parliament in 2008, he arrived in Rome in a T-shirt bearing the words “Padania is not Italy”.Then in 2012, prosecutors discovered that the Northern League’s treasurer had misappropriated some €40m in public money, and that hundreds of thousands of euros had gone to the Bossi family. A party that had run on the slogan of “Roma, ladrona!” (“thieving Rome”) had been caught out in the basest kind of corruption. Money had gone to pay for renovations of the Bossi home, a luxury car and a phony university degree purchased in Albania for Bossi’s less-than-brilliant son, who was being groomed for a leadership position.Salvini managed to wrest the party from Bossi and the old guard, dropped the word “Northern” (against their wishes), and embraced nationalism. What propelled the Lega from the margins to the centre of Italian life was a combination of Salvini’s shrewd political instincts and a perfect storm of external events. A first sign of that change came in 2014, when Salvini acknowledged that he would be rooting for the national football team – a big concession (believe it or not) for a Lega leader.The battle cry at his demonstrations was no longer the exploitation of the north by the rest of the country, but immigration, Roma encampments and the indifference of the European Union to Italy’s problems. His first big rally featured a banner saying “Stop the Invasion”. In 2015, he took a risk by organising a major rally in Rome – unusual for the Lega – and took the stage with leaders of neo-fascist groups, against the advice of older Lega leaders, who were vocally anti-fascist. Salvini brushed aside the criticism as a small price for creating a broader, national message. “For tender-hearted journalists and leftists, the problem is 10 rightwing kids reading a pamphlet,” he said. “For me, the problem is the thousands of illegal immigrants stealing, raping and dealing drugs.”Salvini, like the leaders of other insurgent populist movements, has made highly effective use of social media. If Donald Trump has Twitter, Salvini is the king of Facebook. In the second half of 2015, Salvini tripled his Facebook following: capitalising on the refugee crisis and growing discontent with Matteo Renzi’s centrist government, he added nearly 400,000 followers in just six months. At the time, the Italian edition of Wired magazine reported that Salvini posted an average of 10 times a day, “doing in a week what his competitors do in six months”. Since then, his following has increased more than fivefold, to 2.9 million.The magazine found that Salvini’s following often spiked after he made an especially provocative statement – such as declaring, in 2016, that the pope’s welcome to immigrants would “encourage and fund an unprecedented invasion”. But another Wired study found that Salvini has become increasingly sophisticated in the last few years, stimulating positive feelings as well as the usual negative emotions of anger and fear. “The rhetorical strategy is clear: you lower the reader’s guard by playing on fear and anger, but also suggesting that, by putting faith in the Lega, things will get better,” the magazine concluded. “There is a positive element to his posts, even a bit of joy.”However, the old message is still loud and clear. In a post this month, Salvini wrote: “A 25-year-old girl was attacked in the Milan train station, saving herself from RAPE only through use of pepper spray. The rapist was arrested today, let’s hope this time he finds a judge who keeps him in prison for years. P.S. I am not allowed to tell you that the rapist is Nigerian, an illegal immigrant with a criminal record, or I will be accused of RACISM.” (Salvini declined to mention that the victim of the attempted rape in Milan was herself an immigrant, who was returning home at 5am after working a night shift.)In spite of his hard line on immigration and inflammatory rhetoric, Salvini has actually presented himself as a softer and more approachable figure to most Italians. This impression has been aided by the contrast with Bossi, the Lega’s founder, who carried himself like a barroom brawler, threatening to punch protesters at public rallies and making free use of obscenities and insults. In 2001, Bossi said he only used the Italian flag to “wipe his arse”. Salvini, on the other hand, comes across as the nice guy who lives down the block. He is known for giving blood and organising blood-donation drives, and makes frequent references to “mamma” and “papa”, to goodness and generosity.“Matteo is very human,” says Lucia Borgonzoni, a Lega member of parliament and the new minister of culture. “He is very approachable, likes to be with people, takes as many pictures with people as they want. Not because he has to, but because he likes it. As well as political ability, he has real human qualities. Matteo transmits a sense of hope.”Salvini has skilfully deployed this double persona for political gain. In 2014, Salvini made a provocative visit to a Roma encampment on the edge of Bologna, after Borgonzoni, then a city councillor, had been slapped during an earlier visit. (Salvini had declared he would happily take a bulldozer to Roma shantytowns, so the Lega was understandably unpopular there.)When Borgonzoni and Salvini arrived, their car was predictably surrounded by protestors, who began banging on the windows, while one demonstrator jumped on the front of the car as it began to drive away. “The driver started to speed up because these people were genuinely violent,” Borgonzoni recalls, “but Matteo told him to slow down, he was worried that the young man might get hurt. That’s Matteo. He cares about everyone. Meanwhile, our critics on the left did not condemn the violence – saying, ‘They asked for it. What did they expect?’ As if violence against your opponents is somehow different than other kinds of violence.”Above all, it was good politics. The incident depicted Salvini as a tough guy, but with a kind heart – unafraid to visit a Roma camp he had promised to bulldoze, but avoiding violence and even being a victim of aggression. Images of the attack on Salvini spread quickly, and won him another 10,000 Facebook followers in a single day.Salvini moves deftly between online and offline politics: his Facebook page boosts the turnout for his appearances, and posts videos of his speeches and interviews to build up his online following. The young heads of his social media team are integral to Salvini’s success: they were often present at the most important political meetings, including those in which he negotiated the Lega’s partnership with the Five Star Movement.Although Salvini cultivates a strongman image, he alternates soothing traditional Italian references to love, friendship and family with harsh attacks on his enemies: criminal immigrants, mainstream journalists, financial and cultural elites, faceless EU bureaucrats and bankers. He addresses his Facebook followers as “friends”, but makes frequent use of the term “enemy” as well.“Populist groups always have to have an in-group and an out-group – an ‘us’ and a ‘them’,” explains Nicoletta Cavazza, a political scientist at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. “Salvini managed to keep the basic structure of the Lega discourse, but shifted the ‘us’ to all Italians – and he substituted Rome with Brussels, so the enemy was no longer southerners, but immigrants.”Salvini’s rise to power has heightened concerns in Italy about the escalation of racist and xenophobic violence in the country. Dozens of attacks on black people and Roma have been recorded in the last year, all over Italy, from Treviso in the north to Gioia Tauro in the south, including Florence and Rome. The attacks range from drive-by shootings with air guns, in which the attackers were reported to shout “Salvini!” to the assassination of a Malian trade unionist campaigning for fair pay for migrant workers. An Italian athlete of Nigerian descent, Daisy Osakue, the Italian under-23 champion discus thrower, was hit in the eye by an egg thrown from a car. Police have been pursuing attackers and making arrests, but the government has been more reticent. After a torrent of criticism for his anti-migrant policies – culminating with the headline “Get behind me, Salvini” on the cover of Italy’s largest Catholic magazine – Salvini responded with a favorite phrase of Mussolini: “many enemies, much honor.” He also insisted that the idea of widespread Italian racism was “an invention of the left”.Others worry about an increasingly ugly atmosphere. A judge in Milan described how she had been harassed by a car full of Italian men, who shouted at her and followed her after she gave some loose change to a Bangladeshi selling flowers near her office. “What are you doing?” they yelled. “These people are a nuisance and need to leave, and you give them money. Basta!”But the Lega’s Lorenzo Fontana, now the families minister, insists that the only racism is one practised against Italians who dare to think differently about immigration. “Racism has become an ideological weapon,” Fontana wrote on Facebook, “used by the globalists and their slaves (some journalists and mainstream commentators, certain parties) to point the finger at the Italian people and falsely accuse them of every kind of dirty business.”Salvini’s brand of populism is not without precedent in Italy. The Lega Lombarda, the original Lega founded by Bossi, was a protest party against the corruption and fiscal overreach of the government in Rome. In the late 1980s and early 90s, it captured a growing popular anger and disillusionment with a system that was labelled Partitocrazia – “rule by the parties” – in which the politicians in power ided up the spoils and bribes for government contracts to finance their parties, and often, to line their own pockets.The Lega’s rebellion against the system helped set the tone for the major anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Clean Hands, whose findings led directly to the dissolution of the Christian Democratic party and four other satellite parties that had traditionally made up Italy’s coalition governments during the postwar period.Ironically, it was a major beneficiary of this system – the TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi – who rode this populist wave to power in 1994. Like Trump, Berlusconi perfected a style of billionaire populism, a super-rich and super-successful man who spoke in the plain, often crude idiom of the man on the street, bragged about his wealth and success with women, and promised to make all Italians as rich as he was. He railed against the country’s cultural and political elites, and promised to substitute his northern-Italian business knowhow for the corrupt inefficiency and bureaucratic red tape of the professional politicians in Rome.Berlusconi gained power by shrewdly allying himself with Bossi’s separatist Lega Nord in the north, and with a nationalist far-right, post-fascist party, the National Alliance, in the south. He stole Bossi’s populist thunder and co-opted the Lega by giving the “anti-system” party money and positions of power in his governments. Of course, Berlusconi’s populism proved to be entirely phony. He was inept at governance, and more interested in protecting his own private interests than reforming Italy’s economy. He left in place – and exploited to the hilt – the patronage system that the old parties had created and Italy’s economy consistently performed worse than virtually all 28 countries in the European Union.Over 25 years, Berlusconi alternated – and sometimes shared power – with the main centre-left party. The merry-go-round of coalition governments, of infighting and compromises among the country’s leaders, created the impression of a political world that was principally concerned with its own preservation rather than the growing problems of the country as a whole.This set the scene for a new wave of populism, incarnated by the Five Star Movement, now Salvini’s partner in government. Five Star is the brainchild of an unlikely alliance between Grillo, the foul-mouthed comic, and a cerebral internet guru called Gianroberto Casaleggio. Grillo had built a large, faithful audience for his standup performances, which skewered corrupt Italian politicians, greedy bankers and multinational corporations, and sometimes featured bizarre conspiracy theories about cancer cures and the dangers of vaccines being covered up by pharmaceutical companies. Casaleggio correctly intuited that with a blog and a well-run interactive website (run by his company in Milan, Casaleggio Associates) Grillo could become a political force. The blog, which was set up in 2005, attracted millions of visitors, and morphed into the Five Star Movement in 2009.The two outsider parties – Lega and Five Star – ran in the March 2018 elections not as allies, but competitors. Salvini ran in a centre-right alliance with Berlusconi and a couple of far-right, neo-fascist parties. Both Lega and Five Star describe themselves as being “neither left nor right”. Salvini’s followers are decidedly Trumpian, while Five Star attracts disaffected people from across the political spectrum, including younger and better-educated left-of-centre voters. The party has always emphasised environmental issues, clean energy and alternative transportation, and opposed plans for high-speed rail lines through environmentally fragile areas.However, both parties were sharply critical of Italy’s ruling establishment, while also promising to maintain most of the country’s generous social programmes. Both were highly critical of the EU and the euro, and cast a fond eye toward Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.Events played into their hands. As Libya fell into chaos, the number of desperate refugees hoping to reach Europe by boat increased exponentially. In 2014, Salvini’s first year as party secretary, there was a huge jump in the number of people entering Italy from north Africa – from 42,000 in 2013 to 170,000 in 2014, reaching a peak of 181,000 in 2016, a year in which 5,000 people drowned trying to make the crossing.That same year, some 157,000 Italians left the country in search of a better future. While these two migrations are not connected, for many Italians this all feeds into a gut feeling that their country is heading in the wrong direction. Salvini’s great political achievement has been to turn this discontent against the enemies of his choosing: migrants, the EU and Italy’s political elite.Renzi’s centre-left government passed a “jobs act”, which was supposed to boost employment by giving employers greater flexibility in hiring and firing. This had only a small impact on employment, but increased the number of young people hired on a temporary basis, often with low salaries. Many young Italians live with their parents well into their 30s, too economically insecure to marry and start families. “You need an element of certainty to start a family,” says Massimo Garavaglia, a senator for the Lega and undersecretary of finance in the new coalition government.While stopping boatloads of refugees from north Africa may satisfy an emotional need to restore a sense of order to immigration, it doesn’t change the basic demographic arithmetic, which shows that Italy actually needs a healthy level of immigration to survive. Last year, 664,000 Italians died, while only 464,000 Italian babies were born – 100,000 of those were of mixed couples, with one Italian parent and one foreign-born one, according to Istat, the national statistics bureau. If the country is going to maintain something close to its current population of 60 million and have enough working people to keep its pension system afloat, it will have to add to its population. Most of Italy’s immigrants are young, arrived legally, and are working and paying taxes. Both the Lega and Five Star jumped on the immigration issue during the election campaign. Luigi Di Maio, the 32-year-old leader of the Five Star Movement – who is deputy prime minister together with Salvini – attacked the NGOs who were rescuing refugees at sea and bringing them to Italy. “Who pays these taxis in the Mediterranean?” Di Maio provocatively asked.And while Salvini and Di Maio say they have nothing against legal immigration, they seem dead against most means of encouraging it. Salvini vehemently opposed the “ius soli” bill proposed by the previous centre-left government, which would have given citizenship to children of immigrants if they were born in Italy or arrived at a young age and did their schooling there, and at least one of their parents had been in Italy legally for five years. The Five Star Movement, deeply conflicted on the issue, decided to abstain from voting, effectively killing the bill.Despite the increase in immigration in the past 15 years, Italy’s crime rates have actually gone down – but crime is much higher among illegal immigrants, who often live in makeshift quarters, hang out and sleep in parks and train stations, and are hired to do irregular or illegal work that can range from hawking counterfeit designer knockoffs to selling drugs.The EU’s policy – or lack of policy – has only made matters worse. “The European Union made a huge mistake in selfishly leaving Italy alone to contend with the refugee crisis,” says Pier Giorgio Ardeni, director of the Cattaneo Institute, a social science thinktank in Bologna. The EU rules were that the countries receiving immigrants had the duty to sort out those who qualify for political asylum from those who do not. This meant the burden of the massive uptick in refugees fell mainly on Italy, Greece and Spain – all countries contending with major economic problems.The Italian government and the EU agreed to pay €35 a day for those willing to house refugees. A few communities have used these funds wisely, to fix up abandoned housing and reinvigorate towns that have lost residents in recent years. Others, however, have housed refugees in substandard dwellings and pocketed most of the money. “Do you know how much I make with immigrants?” one of the chief defendants in the prosecution of mafia corruption in the Rome city government said to an interlocutor in a wiretapped phone conversation. “They are worth more than drugs.”Salvini cannily anticipated and took advantage of the crisis. He began hitting out against the EU well ahead of the Brexit vote. He had the political intuition (or luck) to back Trump when other European politicians – including Berlusconi – recoiled in horror. Salvini travelled to Philadelphia to meet – and, importantly, to be photographed with – Trump in April 2016, before he had secured the Republican nomination. “It’s the triumph of the people against globalisation, against the mainstream press and the big economic interests,” Salvini declared after Trump’s victory.While defying calls from the Roman Catholic church to welcome immigrants, Salvini avoids direct confrontation and insists his policies are perfectly consistent with church doctrine. “The catechism,” he said again at Pontida, “says rich nations should welcome strangers within the limits of the possible. In Italy, we have reached the limits of the possible. We apply the catechism by opening Italy’s doors to women and children who come here legally on aeroplanes, but no more men on rubber dinghies. We will help them grow up and work in their own countries. Let’s spend in Africa the money that needs to be spent.”One of the big questions of Italian politics is how this odd-couple marriage between the Lega and Five Star will work. Although the Lega is technically the junior partner in the alliance, having far fewer seats in parliament, Salvini has stolen the spotlight from his fellow deputy prime minister Di Maio. (The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, a virtually unknown constitutional law professor, was a compromise solution.) Five Star’s founder, Grillo, insists he wants nothing to do with electoral politics and has delegated the day-to-day running of the party to Di Maio, who has only about five years of political experience.Five Star’s representatives are almost all relatively new to politics. They are often better educated than the Lega leaders, and more likely to have university degrees, but less experienced in the hard-knock world of practical politics. Moreover, Five Star was born out of a deep distrust of traditional politics, and its representatives (they dislike the word “leaders”) have taken a vow to withdraw from electoral politics after only two terms in office. This would mean Di Maio being unable to run for office after this current parliament – at the age of just 37. Salvini, by contrast, has been in politics for 25 years, and appears in it for the long term.“The Five Star Movement is a thin, virtual party that exists mostly on social media,” says Flavio Tosi, the former Lega mayor of Verona. “The Lega by contrast is rooted in the territory, has competently governed many cities and regions, and has developed a leadership class.”In forming their heterodox coalition, Salvini and Di Maio hammered out a “contract” for their government, agreeing on several key ideas. “There are things we have in common, and at the same time, the Lega has certain rightwing ideas that we don’t share,” says Maria Edera Spadoni, a Five Star member of parliament and vice-president of the chamber of deputies, Italy’s lower house, who worked as a flight attendant before she began attending Five Star meetings in her home town of Emilia Romagna in 2009. “The beauty of the idea of a government contract is that it lays out what we have both agreed to, and leaves out the things on which we don’t agree: certain environmental issues, gay marriage. Certain civil rights will not be touched.”Few experts see these proposals as workable, or capable of producing long-term growth. “These proposals to abolish the Fornero law and to institute a flat tax are pure demagoguery,” says Ardeni, of the Cattaneo Institute. Significantly, the new government has put those proposals on hold while it attends to other business. For the moment, the government says it will only apply the flat tax to businesses, not iniduals.If the new government struggles on the economic front, the temptation will be to push “identity” issues, which cost nothing, but rally the troops. Salvini has already proposed placing the crucifix in every public place (not just in classrooms, where it already exists) in order to reinforce the country’s traditions. He has also pushed the idea of armed self-defence along the lines of US “stand your ground” laws, which permit the use of firearms in self-defence against an intruder. The Lega families minister, Fontana, proposed scrapping a law that bans hate speech, the promotion of racial discrimination and the advocacy of fascism – a proposal immediately rejected by Di Maio and Five Star. Fontana also caused a scandal by announcing there was no such thing as a “gay family”.In explaining his own conversion from fervent separatist to Italian nationalist, Salvini insists the common denominator is the question of identity and territory. “I was also drawn to politics linked to a territory,” he explained in an interview for a recent biography (Il Militante, by the journalists Alessandro Franzi and Alessandro Madron). “At school everything was left v right, communists and fascists what interested me was the discussion of identity, autonomy, federalism and community.” If he is a nationalist and not a regional separatist, he says, it is because the threats to identity have changed. Before, a centralised Italian state was eroding regional culture and language, and overtaxing the prosperous north. Now the threats to identity, in his view, are an overbearing EU, globalisation and out-of-control immigration.Others see Salvini’s about-face in a more jaundiced light. “I think his nationalism is a cynical calculation but from a purely Machiavellian point of view, it’s been masterful,” says Tosi, who was a rival to Salvini in the battle for leadership in 2013. “They don’t have the stomach or the ability to deal with the big structural reforms Italy needs, and so I think they are going to hammer away at the immigration issue. Immigration is the glue that holds them together. But if you can’t deal with the economic issues, eventually the voters will recognise that – and I don’t know what will happen then.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df98fd54ec5f149754e94868ef5d015b3075a21f/0_202_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a2ef1e60fa36dcce15988ff5d14b81e","title":"may letter to grassroots tories aims to quell brexit","story":"PM defends common rulebook for trade in message backed by cabinet BrexitersTheresa May has sought to calm fractious Tory grassroots activists angry with her Chequers Brexit plan, writing inidual members a lengthy letter endorsed by sceptical cabinet Brexiters including Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox.The prime minister’s charm offensive over the past few weeks has been aimed at convincing Conservative party members of the merits of her offer to the EU, outlined in the Brexit white paper. It includes a free-trade area for goods governed by a common rulebook.The deal had prompted David Davis and Boris Johnson to quit the government, saying it was not in line with their vision of a post-EU Britain.The letter from May, received by Tory party members on Tuesday, follows a concerted effort by Conservatives to woo party chairs. There have been in-person briefings with May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, and the party chair, Brandon Lewis.Tory chiefs have been alarmed at the extent of the backlash from the grassroots and May herself took part in a conference call to take questions directly from local chairs.In the three-page letter, estimated by ConservativeHome to have cost the party about £70,000, May repeatedly acknowledges the grassroots’ disquiet, referring to the “strong feelings members of our party have on this important national issue”, and saying there had been “a number of questions” about how a common rulebook would affect sovereignty.The letter takes aim at critics who have described the Chequers’ offer as capitulation. “It is in no sense a concession to their demands,” she wrote. “I have been very clear that we are rejecting the two models they have put forward.”Polling by the ConservativeHome website found members bitterly opposed to the Chequers proposal, three in five calling it a bad deal.A further survey by the site discovered that the popularity of cabinet ministers who backed the deal – including former leadership frontrunners Michael Gove and Sajid Javid – had plummeted. Johnson, however, soared to the top of members’ preferences for next Tory leader for the first time since 2016.On Wednesday a handful of party members posted pictures on social media of themselves discarding May’s letter or tearing it into pieces.The script preps Tory members to answer questions such as “is this Brexit in name only?” and “won’t the EU just reject this?” which includes the reply “both sides have to compromise”.Among those endorsing the deal on paper are the Eurosceptic cabinet ministers Fox and Leadsom, as well as Gove, who is environment secretary, and the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab.Leadsom, who was reported to have told colleagues she hated the Chequers deal but was prepared to back the prime minister, is quoted as saying: “This proposal puts the power back in the hands of parliament ... this allows our laws to be decided directly by those we elect.”Fox’s endorsement says the deal will “give the UK the freedom to sign our own independent trade deals”. Raab calls it a “credible vision ... a principled and practical Brexit”.May’s letter also takes pains to emphasise future trade. “I know that some people are concerned that this common rulebook will stop us doing trade deals,” she wrote. “I can assure you this is not the case – and I would not be proposing it if it would.”Among those endorsing the deal was Rob Semple, chair of the National Conservative Convention, the members’ body. In his quote Semple appears to acknowledge some differences in the party over the plan, saying it took “on board differing views within the Conservative party and country as a whole ... it is therefore incumbent on the party that we support the prime minister”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13ac1d6c95696bca81f141fd4036d15fe2f094c3/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84f055a94f095ac6b4d18bb3e2cbde8b","title":"im already stockpiling readers preparing for a messy brexit","story":"We hear from readers who have plans in place in case Britain runs out of food after a no-deal BrexitBritain could run out of food by this time next year if it cannot maintain the flow of goods after Brexit, the National Farmers’ Union has said. After it emerged that the government was drawing up plans to stockpile food in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the British Retail Consortium and drug manufacturers issued more warnings about possible supply shortages, we asked for your views.About 300 readers got in touch, with more than half saying they had already started stockpiling or were seriously considering doing so, and the rest sharing their concerns about shortages after a no-deal Brexit. The most popular food items people wanted to store were staples such as flour, olive oil, dried pasta, rice, powdered milk, coffee and tinned items such as tomatoes and sardines. Many readers also highlighted “luxuries” such as chocolate, and there was mention of stocking up on over-the-counter medicines such as painkillers and antihistamines.Many respondents acknowledged that people would have to be in a relatively privileged position to be able to plan ahead. Here are some of your reasons for stockpiling and views on the practicalities of putting together an “insurance policy” in the larder.I am trying to do my best to avoid political rhetoric and look only at facts. While I still have faith that the people behind the politicians, the civil servants, industry leaders, lawyers and indeed the administrators of the EU are working hard to prevent a no-deal Brexit, the facts around reverting to WTO regulations leave me concluding that April 2019 could be a very sensible time to be self-sufficient, so I’m already stockpiling.My first purchase was an additional shelving rack for the garage and several plastic storage crates, to ensure the “Brexit supplies” are kept separately to everyday food. Each time I go to a supermarket, 2-3 times a week, I am doubling up on all non-perishable or long-date items and throwing a few extras into the trolley. So far I’ve bought mainly tinned goods: soup, different types of beans, tuna and sardines, chopped tomatoes. Also, jars of olives, capers and lots of dried pasta. I plan to spend around £100 a month until we know more about what might happen in March. The chest freezer will be filled with meat, but at the moment I’m looking to ensure we have the absolute basics rather than luxuries. I have also bought flour, yeast etc and will endeavour to learn to bake bread. I have bought ibuprofen, toothpaste and toilet paper as part of doubling up on non-perishable goods. In the event that food supplies are not affected, I will donate any stockpiled items to food banks. So far, my one “luxury” touch is three-packs of Boost chocolate bars at £1 each and with long dates.I am very worried about a no-deal Brexit, while also acknowledging that the chances of this are remote, despite what Liam Fox may publicly utter. I liken it to the tech billionaires who have bought up land in remote parts of New Zealand in case of global nuclear war: the probability is tiny, but the consequences are truly terrible, so it is worth a proportionately small investment in insulating oneself. Adam Roberts, 35, LeedsThere are too many people who seem to have forgotten about (or are too young to remember) the late 1970s and early 80s – 3 million unemployed, serious economic dislocation, and riots stemming from deprivation mixed with a simmering frustration and fury at an out-of-touch government.We also seem to have enough idiots at the helm who are quite willing to drive this country off an economic cliff-edge, knowing that they personally have good financial cushions to land on and who really aren’t bothered about the “collateral damage” they’ll inflict on others. Plus I don’t think they really understand the practicalities of how goods, including food, are distributed andor stored these days. I mean, what exactly is the government going to stockpile and where? I don’t believe this country has the capacity to stockpile any serious food supplies. David Bates, 54, BermondseySince the day of the advisory referendum I’ve been more keenly aware of the need to prepare, but what really kickstarted it was headlines about the government starting to stockpile. It comes down to a simple question: do I trust the government to take care of my family in the event of a crisis, or do we need to take responsibility ourselves? The way I see it, we still have a little time to get a head start on things.Even if nothing happens from Brexit, it’s handy to have a month or two’s supply of tinned food in the house in case we get snow like last year, or you’re ill or lose your job. There are plenty of situations where it’ll come in handy. The key is to only store what you enjoy eating, and actually use the stockpile, don’t just shove it in the shed and forget about it. I’ve got cartons of passata, tinned tuna, carrots, potatoes, onions, pulses, water chestnuts, plum tomatoes, curry paste jars, coconut milk, tomato puree, rice, pasta, water, orange juice, squash, spaghetti hoops, soups, stews, tinned fruit, herbs and spices. I’ve also got a good amount of DIY tools, buckets, lightbulbs, matches, candles, firewood, bleach, Dettol, first-aid items and common medicines. It’s an insurance policy of sorts. I recognise that I’m in a fairly privileged position to be able to do this: not everyone can afford a few hundred quid on unnecessary tins. But I have to look after my family, and I would encourage everyone else to do the same if they can. If you don’t end up needing it, you can eat it or donate to a food bank, because God knows they’ll need it. If you do need it, you’ll be glad of it. Thomas, ShrewsburySo far Brexit proceedings have been disastrous, in my opinion, and I fear we have not yet seen the worst of it. Food shortages will only be one of many trials ahead of us and I have already started to stockpile tinned food. I normally don’t use much, but any port in a storm.I’ve got tinned veg, fruit, pulses, corned beef, spam, sardines, salmon – things I could put a reasonably balanced meal together with. Cordon bleu it won’t be! Healthy? Not overflowing with vitamins, but not bad. I’m too young to remember rationing, but living in the north-east of England in the 50s was not a land of milk and honey – people bought bacon by the slice and butter by the ounce from the dearly beloved Co-operative Stores, which sold food loose from sacks and barrels. People nowadays couldn’t cope with that. If I have to, I’ll dig up my garden and grow my own fresh veg. Fresh fruit is what I would miss most of all, and you can’t stockpile that. Anne Neale, 62, CullercoatsI am making the assumption that most locally produced goods will be fine but anything that comes from further afield will not. So I am planning to buy a two- to three-month supply of staples – pasta, rice, flour, pulses. I assume that British milk will be just fine, but will probably buy some powdered milk and UHT just in case. I will buy additional supplies of canned fruit and tomatoes, tea and coffee.I have been thinking about buying a small chest freezer and running a cable down our small back garden to the shed so we can stock up on frozen veg – broccoli, green beans, spinach – as well as frozen berries, orange juice and fish (guessing Cornish mackerel and Scottish will not be affected, unless all the fishermen decide to move to Spain). We buy our veg from an organic veg co-op, so fingers crossed they will carry on with their UK box. Lettuce is not freezable, so l will grow my own! Victoria Whitford, LondonThis is less theoretical for me than for some – I have started stockpiling, just a couple of items every week. Although I of course hope the nonsense in parliament will resolve itself, and better yet Brexit will be stopped altogether, I have a young son to support and can’t afford to be caught up in the panic buying that will undoubtedly occur when a no-deal is near.So far I am buying tinned food including beans and tomatoes, rice and pasta, tinned fish and bottled water. I will also buy tinned meat. I hasten to add I’m not a “prepper”, I’ve never done this before in my life and never saw myself needing to do so. But my family is too important to me for me to take such a risk. I only wish the politicians would think in the same way. Ed, 33, GloucestershireWe’ve been considering stockpiling for a while as part of wider concerns about food supply chain disruption and as part of a drive to ensure that we lower our household waste, making us more resilient as a household. Brexit emerged as a final prompt as it appears to be a credible trigger, at least for short-term supply issues.I am most worried about Brexit disruption in the initial period, assuming a no-deal (food and medicine primarily), but longer-term I worry about the diminishing opportunities for my children in this country and an erosion of the standards and (some admittedly imperfect) safeguards on food, manufacturing, workers’ rights and environmental standards.I also worry about the effect Brexit is having on our culture – it feels as though the toxicity it has unleashed and the resurgence of the far right is far from played out. I don’t think stockpiling will in any way protect us from those longer-term and chronic issues. It provides a bit of a comfort blanket, but no real aid. I’m not panicking about Brexit but I am taking it seriously.

Government can help to bring together the resources, policies and people who, between them, can do so,” the strategy says.It comes out as local authorities – a key source of funding for many local charities – warn that voluntary groups will have to take on the delivery of services that councils can no longer afford because of funding cuts.The strategy is likely to be regarded with scepticism by many in the voluntary sector who feel that while austerity has driven up demand for charity services, ministers have failed to support the sector financially and sought to silence its views.Although the paper published by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is coy about the big society programme championed by former prime minister David Cameron’s government, it shares many of its objectives.Cameron’s big society idea was launched with great fanfare in 2010 as a way of bringing charities and social enterprises in to replace supposedly monolithic and bureaucratic public services, but it failed to gain traction and was widely mocked as a cover for cuts to public services.The new strategy promises £165m in funds taken from dormant bank accounts and charitable trusts to support community foundations, set up organisations to get disadvantaged people into employment, and tackle financial exclusion.It also includes plans to launch “innovation in democracy” pilots in six regions around the country are also included in the document, to trial ways for people to take a more direct role in community decision-making through possible online polls, apps or “citizens’ juries”. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, and the civil society minister, Tracey Crouch, write in the foreword: “Big societal challenges, including the future of social care, community integration, and housing, are being tackled through solutions that bring together public services, businesses, and communities. “New providers are taking responsibility for youth services, domestic abuse services, addiction services, and offender rehabilitation services. New models are developing for funding and running libraries as well as children’s services.”They add: “All this is happening because of the resourcefulness of the British people.”They claim that civil society, philanthropy and volunteering is thriving in the UK, while businesses “are rediscovering the original purpose of the corporation: to deliver value to society, not just quarterly returns to shareholders”.Ministers two years ago attempted to introduce a “gagging clause” on charities who received public funding, preventing them campaigning on so-called “political” issues. This was subsequently diluted after an outcry.The strategy says: “The government is determined that charities and social enterprises should be fully confident in their right to speak in public debates, and to have a strong role in shaping policy and speaking up on behalf of those they support.”Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said: “The strategy is an encouraging start, carrying a strong recognition of the role that civil society plays in tackling some of today’s greatest challenges, and of the need to ensure its involvement in developing new solutions.“The real test will be embedding the strategy’s aspirations across government, ensuring expert charities are truly involved in policymaking, and that procurement processes work as well for smaller charities as they do for big outsourcing companies.”Northamptonshire county council, which is technically insolvent and needs to make £70m of cuts over the coming months, has said it wants to encourage behaviour change in communities to create resilience in places where the council can no longer step in.East Sussex county council said neighbourhood voluntary groups would have to take increasing responsibility for supporting older people who would no longer qualify for social care support because of big cuts.We’d like your help to find out more about current or future cuts to UK council services.

Yet on Wednesday the Englishman appraised in generous terms his third gold medal of the European Championships, in the 50m breaststroke. “Execution was probably 9.5,” he said. “But the race itself was 10 out of 10.”Without the lustre of lowering his own world record, as he had done over 100m last weekend, there was almost a dash of disappointment when victory was the lone landmark. His time of 26.09sec, with Italy’s Fabio Scozzoli claiming silver and Peter John Stevens of Slovenia bronze, was a championship best. It secured his 11th European gold and he supplanted Fran Halsall as the most successful Briton in the Championships’ history he has the opportunity to make it a round dozen in the concluding 4x100 medley on Thursday.Peaty expects to carve out more history at the 2019 world championships in the South Korean city of Gwangju. “I missed a few strokes which cost me zero-point-zero something but I don’t think it would have got me the world record. But next year is looking very strong: very good power-wise, very good technique-wise.”Sweden’s Sarah Sjoestroem earned her third gold here by claiming the 100m freestyle title for the fourth consecutive time. There was another display of the immense potential of Freya Anderson when the 17-year-old from the Wirral took fourth place in a European junior record of 53.16sec.Siobhan-Marie O’Connor missed out on bronze in the 200m inidual medley by two-hundredths of a second as Hungary’s Katinka Hosszu won the event for the fifth time.Ben Proud will be favourite in the 50m freestyle on Thursday after setting a British and championship record of 21.11sec in his semi-final. Imogen Clark lowered the British best to 30.04 finishing second in her 50m breaststroke semi-final.Jazz Carlin makes her championship bow in the 10km open water event in Loch Lomond on Thursday. The 27-year-old confessed to a lack of motivation after claiming silver in the 400m and 800m freestyle at Rio 2016. “The change has brought reinvigoration,” she said, but it is has been a radical shift.“When I first got into it, I was looking at everyone that was touching me and I was a bit like: ‘How dare you.’ Obviously you can do that, it’s part of the sport, it’s part of the race. So you’ve just got to be content with getting a few slaps on the head, the wrist and everything, and accept it.”Grace Reid and Ross Haslam took silver in the 3m mixed springboard event at the ing European Championships in Edinburgh. With Tom Daley taking extended paternity leave, the 20-year-old Englishman has stepped in as Reid’s replacement partner.Her chances of retaining a share in the title were thwarted by an impressive display from the German duo Tina Punzel and Lou Massenberg with a score of 313.50. “But it was a tough field and we came away with a personal best,” Reid said. Lois Toulson and Robyn Birch were fifth and sixth in the 10m platform final, won by Celine van Duijn of the Netherlands.Great Britain’s Jess Learmonth defends her women’s triathlon European title in Motherwell on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f82623a5031ea44f9ef06ed29bca79beee401b/0_158_4161_2497/master/4161.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=727a85d352372208ef733ba50149261f","title":"dina asher smith zharnel hughes sprint golden generation","story":"Taking both 100m titles at European championships gives rise to talk of Britain overtaking Jamaica in sprinting stakesAfter a golden night, an emboldened morning. Zharnel Hughes was still groggy-eyed after storming to European 100m gold – a lack of sleep rather than a celebratory blowout was to blame – but his vision of British sprinting’s future was delivered with startling clarity. “I think this is a golden generation,” he said. “A new breed.”And then, after rattling off the names of Dina Asher-Smith, Reece Prescod and CJ Ujah – as well as Adam Gemili and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, who have qualified for tonight’s 200m final – Hughes made another extraordinary prediction.Asked if he thought that by the Tokyo Olympics people will be talking about British sprinters in the way we have talked about Jamaica in previous Olympics, he replied: “Yeah, I definitely think so. I definitely do.“Dina has a world-leading time, I ran 9.9 and we’re still young. We still have two years ahead of us before Tokyo. We can get much stronger and much faster. That’s when we’re at our peak. I actually didn’t see the women’s race until after mine. That’s when I heard Dina’s time. I thought: ‘Whaaat, 10.85, that’s reaaaaally quick.”Such giddiness is surely premature, given previously annointed golden generations have not always lived up to the hype. But Hughes’s optimism is understandable. Asher-Smith’s time would have been good enough for gold at last year’s world championships, after all. And he has perhaps a better insight than most about what is possible, given he trains in Jamaica under Usain Bolt’s coach, Glenn Mills.Hughes reckoned he would have run in the low 9.80s in the 100m final if he had not suffered cramp beforehand. On Friday Asher-Smith begins the second leg of what she hopes will be an extraordinary 100m, 200m and 4x100m treble. But she is not getting carried away. “I was like, ‘10.85, me?’ It was surreal,” she said. “But we knew I could do it because we’d been training for it and I knew if I didn’t mess up I could do it. I am over the moon to have done it.”The 22-year-old had promised herself a treat if she ever ran that fast. But now her priorities have altered. “Now I have done it, I think: ‘I don’t want to treat myself, I want to go a bit faster.’”Asher-Smith has not eaten any fast food since February, although every time she drives past KFC she is a tiny bit tempted. How much harm could it really do, she was asked. “Maybe a couple of 10ths,” she said, laughing. “I might not have run 10.8. That’s the question I ask my coach, and he says ‘you don’t want to find out, do you?’ and I’m like ‘good point.’ It’s been a long season of being very disciplined.”She did not enjoy even a small celebration after her 100m win. “They actually wheeled out ice cream when I came back to the hotel but I turned it down. I’m only a third of the way through my championships.”Asher-Smith also cautioned people not to get too carried away despite Britain’s medal haul in the sprints. “We’re improving but this year is a weird one,” she said. “We have had the unique experience of having the Commonwealths and Europeans so we’re in different shape to other people. We have to wait and see.”After three medals for Britain on the opening day of these European championships there was no further glory on day two, although Tim Duckworth can be proud of a fifth-placed finish in the decathlon. The 22-year-old was in second place before the final event, the 1500m, but his chances of a medal were slim given he is no endurance runner and he trailed home near the back to finish with 8,160 points.Germany’s Arthur Abele took gold with 8,431 and to the delight of the 40,000 crowd, who also bade farewell to the discus great Robert Harting on his final international appearance.On Thursday Katarina Johnson-Thompson gets her heptathlon campaign under way while Holly Bradshaw has a chance of a pole vault medal. But British eyes will, once again, be focused on the sprinters, with the former European champion Gemili and Mitchell-Blake contenders for a medal behind the strong favourite, Ramil Guliyev, in the 200m. Another GB victory there and who knows? Perhaps the golden generation tag will begin to stick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55702d8dace6e163e53444f01f5560f2db8ad548/273_299_2836_1702/master/2836.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65107999a2f290d102a77ee0bbacecb5","title":"england v india second test day one live","story":"The toss has been delayed.

When your Roman friend or colleague claims never to have heard of it, it’s because he or she has probably only ever known it as Giovanni’s.

At €1.40 for one scoop it is slightly more than the average in Germany but the flavours are bright and true. The menu changes regularly – and the delicious cakes are not to be overlooked, either. Tables are few but there are parks nearby where you can enjoy your treats.• Brunnenstraße 156, suessfein-berlin.deShelleyThe flavours are truly a display of craft and inventiveness rose and hibiscus, chocolate and ginger, olive and lemon are all a creamy revelation. The location is beautiful it’s right by several museums – Museum Brandhorst, for art, and the wonderful Reich der Kristalle for crystal displays – and you can just about stroll to the Englischer Garten before your ice-cream starts to melt. Excellent value at €1.60 for a scoop, and you get a spoonful of another flavour to try.• 46 Theresienstraße, ballabeni.detiagoBrymor’s ice-cream is made using the milk from Guernsey cows grazed on the lush grass around the farm close to the ruins of Jervaux Abbey between Middleham and the brewery town of Masham in the Yorkshire dales. Rich, creamy concoctions such as liquorice and blackcurrant, banana and mango or the famous thunder and lightning, or all three, can be enjoyed on site after watching the cows being milked, taking a stroll to enjoy the magnificent Wensleydale scenery, browsing the farm shop and letting the kids run free in one of the play areas. • High Jervaulx Farm, Masham, brymordairyDianeCraig’s makes its own ice-cream, from milk produced by cows on its farm. You can watch them grazing in the fields as you sit on a wooden bench outside the little farm shop. All the regular flavours are available, such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and rum and raisin. Things are kept traditional with apple crumble flavour ice-cream but it also has something a bit more adventurous in Turkish delight,melon and ginger, and lemon cheesecake flavours.Cones from £2.25 portion sizes are generous, so you will not be disappointed. • Craiglea House, Weymouth, craigsfarmdairyCaseyThe freshest, healthiest gelato … and a delightful assault on the senses, as well as inexpensive and served by friendly staff.

A place of sweetness and laughter that my children’s memories will hopefully always return to. • Gelato from £2.20, 11 Agincourt Square, Monnow Street, greenandjenksSarah WoodallFor me, the only place to buy ice-cream is Nicholls of Parkgate. The Nicholls family have been making delicious homemade ice-cream for 75 years. You can buy a cornet at £1.60, or fancy cones and tubs – and even buy a 1 litre box of your favourites to take home. There are more than 10 regular flavours, including banana choc chip, cinder toffee and lemon and line.• The Parade, Parkgate, Neston, nichollsicecream Catherine RenfreyThere are fantastic regular flavours here but new ones are always being experimented with.

It moves fast. • Poortstraat 93, lekkerijs.nlJakobFamily-owned, this typical Spanish ice-cream parlour and turron boutique has a great old-school interior. I thought it was amazingly cheap considering the quality and flavour (around €1.50 a scoop) on offer – and the servings are generous, too. Try orange with chocolate chips or leche merengada (a Spanish classic based on a chilled “whipped milk” and cinnamon drink). Enjoy your ice-cream while strolling around the cathedral area andor the Paseo del Parque boulevard. • Calle Marqués de Larios 5, no website ChrisThis parlour is tucked away in Østerbro but still has queues out of the door. The selection of organic gelato changes daily but extraordinary regulars include hazelnut and bergamot, coffee and lemongrass, lemon and poppy seed and coconut with hibiscus. Would recommend getting at least two scoops of the cinnamon with caramel (about £4) and snapping a photo of the stylish little shop – even the method of displaying the flavours on offer is a typically cool Danish design.• Isoteket, 43 Randersgade, on FacebookRachelOn a quiet alley on the less-touristy side of the River Oder, Lody Roma was opened in 1946 by two soldiers: an Italian and a Pole.

There were also concerns that preparations for the wedding, the first in the imperial family since Akihito’s only daughter married in a low-key ceremony in 2005, could overshadow his abdication on 30 April next year.The 84-year-old will be replaced on the Chrysanthemum throne the following day by his eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito.“We have come to realise the lack of time to make sufficient preparations for various events leading up to our marriage this autumn and our life afterward,” Mako said in a statement at the time. “We believe that we have rushed various things.”Japanese media have reported, however, that Kako’s parents, Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko, were increasingly troubled by media reports that Komuro’s mother was experiencing financial problems stemming from a loan she received from her former partner to cover her son’s tuition.Mako’s parents reportedly told the Komuros at several face-to-face meetings that the wedding could be marred by the mother’s reported debts and that the wedding could not go ahead until the matter had been resolved.There are also concerns that the couple could invite public criticism, as they will receive a lump sum of about 100 million yen ($900,000) from the government to help ease Mako’s exit from the imperial family and into her new non-royal life.Komuro left for New York earlier this month to begin three years of study for the state’s bar exam. No date has been set for the wedding or the series of rituals that precede it, but Kyodo News, citing a source close to the couple, said Mako and Komuro were in regular contact and still intended to marry.

Analysts say sterling’s slide – which makes imports and foreign travel more expensive, but UK exports cheaper – could push up inflation and lead to a renewed squeeze on living standards. The pound dropped below $1.29 in overnight trading. “What we are seeing is broad sterling weakness, a very aggressive weakening trend,” said Peter Kinsella, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Morgan Stanley, though, says it expects Britain to secure a deal by early 2019 and the pound to strengthen accordingly.Theresa May has sought to calm Tory grassroots activists angry with her Chequers Brexit plan, writing inidual members a lengthy letter endorsed by sceptical cabinet Brexiters including Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox. May acknowledges the “strong feelings members of our party have on this important national issue” but argues her plan protects sovereignty and a proposed “common rulebook” with the EU will not stop the UK doing deals with other countries. A handful of party members posted pictures on social media of themselves discarding May’s letter or tearing it up. Polling by the ConservativeHome website has found members bitterly opposed to the Chequers proposal – while Boris Johnson has soared to the top of members’ preferences for next Tory leader, at the same time as the party machine faces pressure to discipline him for insulting women who wear burqas.Cave boys get Thai papers – Three of the “Wild Boar” soccer boys and their coach who were trapped in a cave for almost three weeks have been granted Thai citizenship. The boys had been stateless, despite being born in Thailand, and unable to travel outside of Chiang Rai province, which is home to ethnic minorities from neighbouring Myanmar.Officials said the change of status was not because of the cave ordeal – the boys had all properly applied for their citizenship beforehand. Still, the event was advertised on the local government’s Facebook page with the words: “Wild Boars revel! Got Thai citizenship.”Salisbury sanctions – The United States is to restrict the export of sensitive technology to Russia over the novichok poisonings in Salisbury. The new sanctions provide that if Moscow does not meet a 90-day deadline to renounce chemical and biological weapons and let in inspectors, President Donald Trump is obliged to impose broader sanctions. It is the latest in a string of instances where the Russia policy of the Trump administration as a whole appears tougher than the president’s personal approach. At the July summit in Helsinki he appeared cowed alongside Vladimir Putin.“Let’s ditch, once and for all, the idea that selective schools are an inspiring model for, rather than a major block to, high-quality public education, and start to talk seriously about how to create a common system.”Today, schools campaigner Melissa Benn makes the case for a national education service as the only way to fix a broken system. Academies have not proven to be the answer and “it is clear that the Tories have run out of ideas, bar the expansion of grammars”, she writes. Labour is to publish plans for a universal system of education. Benn writes. “Time to learn the lessons of our global neighbours and phase out selection, reform unfair school admissions, and bring education back into public hands.”Kepa Arrizabalaga has become the world’s most expensive goalkeeper after completing a £71.6m move from Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea.

Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3590706.1533802525!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"south korea bakes in hottest temperatures in a century","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPolice officers stand guard under the shade of canopies at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul, South Korea on August  1st, 2018.  Photograph: EPAYonhap South Korea OutAt least 42 people have died in South Korea, as the country grapples with a record heatwave with temperatures unseen in more than 100 years.This is the highest number of deaths since South Korea began officially counting casualties due to heat in 2011. More than 3,400 people have been treated for heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, since the end of May, officials said.Temperatures in the capital Seoul, which is home to about half the country’s population, reached 39.6 degrees last week, the hottest temperature in 111 years.South Korea has been grappling with the extreme temperatures since late July, which have wreaked havoc on crops across the border in North Korea, a country that has often faced food shortages.Most of the deaths were among elderly and poor people who lack air conditioning in their homes. But at least five died after working outdoors, including a man in his 30s and a migrant worker from Vietnam in his 50s.The government has also said it plans to revise laws to include extreme heat as a form of natural disaster, allowing victims of heat-related deaths or illness to receive compensation.The government has cut electricity prices for July and August in order to encourage citizens to use energy-intensive appliances like air conditioners. The cut is expected to save consumers about 267 billion won (€206 million), according to the ministry of trade, industry and energy.The heat is also impacting the country’s military, in which all men must serve. A conventional ammunition depot exploded due to a “chemical reaction due to high-temperature heat”, the Korea Times reported, citing lawmakers. No one was injured in the explosion, but the magazine was near explosive materials.The storage facility was built above ground rather than in an underground cave which is typically more secure.“Concerning some of the storages in the middle of cities, the Army must immediately search all ammunition storages and check for any hazards possibly leading to accidents affecting citizens,” said opposition lawmaker Kim Joong-ro.The heat has also led to some odd moments, such as when a chick hatched from a carton of eggs left on a balcony. The constant temperature of just below 40 degrees meant there was no need for an incubator. – "},{"url":null,"title":"nasas daring mission touch sun explained","story":"Nasa is preparing to embark on a daring mission to touch the sun on Saturday,  aiming to go closer than any other spacecraft has ventured.The Parker Solar Probe will endure wicked heat while zooming through the solar corona to study this outermost part of the stellar atmosphere that gives rise to the solar wind.The launch is currently targeted for August 11 at 3:33 a.m. EDT (8.33am BST), with an extended launch window through to August 23.To send a probe where you haven\u0027t been before is ambitious. To send it into such brutal conditions is highly ambitious, Nicola Fox, a project scientist from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said.The project, with a $1.5 billion price tag, is the first major mission under Nasa\u0027s Living With a Star programme.Nasa is hoping to use the data collected from the probe to help astronomers predict solar storms and explain some of the deepest mysteries surrounding our source of light and heat.The probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker, is set to use seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to steadily reduce its orbit around the Sun, using instruments designed to image the solar wind and study electric and magnetic fields, coronal plasma and energetic particles.Nasa aims to collect data about the inner workings of the highly magnetized corona.Although 4 million miles sounds like a long way by our tiny standards here on Earth, being that close to the sun is likely to be a risk for the spacecraft.For example, by orbiting the sun at a distance of between 28 and 43 million miles, Mercury\u0027s surface and atmosphere have been completely changed by the constant stream of radiation and particles from the sun.It has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable 29 degrees Celsius even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly 1,370 degrees Celsius at its closest pass.The closest a spacecraft has been before is when Helios 2 came within 27 million miles of the sun in 1976. By way of comparison, the average distance from the Sun for Earth is 93 million miles.Technicians and engineers perform light bar testing on NASA\u0026#39s Parker Solar Probe at the Astrotech processing facility in TitusvilleThe information collected from the probe is likely to help future generations of humans, who may one day live outside the Earth\u0027s atmosphere.Our world has since grown ever more dependent on a network of technology – both in orbit and on our planet\u0027s surface – that\u0027s vulnerable to a threat we barely understand.These people will need the knowledge to protect themselves from severe winds of charged particles and radiation.The resulting data will improve forecasts of major space-weather events that impact life on Earth, as well as satellites and astronauts in space.Alex Young, a solar scientist at NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland, said it was of fundamental importance for us to be able to predict this space weather, much like we predict weather here on Earth.In the most extreme cases of these space weather events, it can actually affect our power grids here on Earth, he added.Please review our commenting policyWasp warning as hot weather brings

But the drought conditions in the state of New South Wales this year have been the driest and most widespread since 1965.The state government said Wednesday that 100 percent of New South Wales\u0027 land area of more than 800,000 square kilometers (309,000 square miles) was now in drought.Primary Industries Minister Niall Blair said farmers were enduring one of the driest Southern Hemisphere winters on record.This is tough. There isn\u0027t a person in the state that isn\u0027t hoping to see some rain for our farmers and regional communities, Blair said in a statement.Cattle on a dry paddock in the drought-hit area of Quirindi in New South WalesFarm reservoirs have dried up and crops are failing.State and federal governments are providing financial help, but not enough for many farmers.With dry conditions forecast to continue for the next three months, farmers had to decide whether to continue the expensive and laborious task of hand-feeding cattle and sheep or sell their livestock.The state government on Wednesday also lifted the number of kangaroos that farmers are allowed to shoot and reduced bureaucratic red tape facing land holders applying for permission to shoot.Farmer Clive Barton walking through the paddocks in the drought-hit area of Duri in New South WalesThe requirement to tag dead kangaroos to keep a tally of the number shot across the state had been dispensed with.Many farmers are taking livestock off their paddocks, only to then see kangaroos move in and take whatever is left, Blair said.If we don\u0027t manage this situation, we will start to see tens of thousands of kangaroos starving and suffering, ultimately leading to a major animal welfare crisis, he added.A train makes its way through dry paddocks in the drought-hit area of Quirindi in New South WalesBut Ray Borda, president of the Kangaroo Industries Association of Australia, which represents commercial shooters who hunt kangaroos for meat and leather, raised animal welfare concerns about the regulation changes.Anybody on the land that will make a phone call to the Department of Environment can get permission to shoot almost whatever they want to shoot and it\u0027s unaudited and unchecked and that\u0027s our concern - animal welfare, Borda told Australian Broadcasting Corp.The government would have been better off subsidizing professional shooters to reduce kangaroo numbers more humanely, he said.We see this as probably the worst possible outcome for the kangaroo, but I\u0027ve got to emphasize we do understand the plight that farmers are in, Borda said. Please review our commenting policyBritain urged to step up sanctions against \u0026#39corrupt\u0026#39 Russia in wake of US interventionBen Stokes wishes England cricket team good luck in Test he is missing ahead of giving evidence in courtTrouble in paradise: Ghost hotels replace celebrity endorsements in NicaraguaStrong 5.9 magnitude quake jolts Indonesia\u0026#39s Lombok, causing panic as death toll reaches 164NHS needs thousands of overseas doctors to plug GP shortage North Korea revives \u0026#39axis of evil\u0026#39 ties with Iran as denuclearisation talks falterArgentina Senate rejects bill to legalise abortion in setback for women\u0026#39s rights groups\u0026#39Consider how upsetting it must be being uprooted\u0026#39 Police force under fire for sympathising with travellersEmotional moment when Korean War veteran\u0026#39s dog tag returned to sons in USComment: Received Pronunciation is the sound of a truly classless BritainIsrael\u0026#39s wave of strikes on Gaza \u0026#39kill pregnant woman and toddler\u0026#39 after militants\u0026#39 rockets hit town of SderotThree men due in court over murder of baby killer in Welsh villageFacebook apologises after confetti and balloons appear on earthquake postsCheese burglar: Hungry thief caught after leaving DNA on a block of Red LeicesterStale cockpit air may be dulling the performance of airline pilotsRevealed: Marie Curie tops list of 10 most influential women of all timeComment: It’s a fiction to suggest that there was no plot by Islamist hardliners to take over state schoolsNasa\u0026#39s daring mission to \u0026#39touch the sun\u0026#39 explainedTheresa May writes letter to Tory grassroots seeking support for Chequers planWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/08/TELEMMGLPICT000171231562_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq2vX1u98YPHn7kC8MGPWAvhEtVTYvoHZrweHwT364EPM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"burka terrifying defend do muslim women like no favours","story":"Some Muslims say the niqab is un-IslamicLOL was the reply I got from my niqab-wearing best mate when I sent her the article that Boris Johnson wrote for this newspaper on Monday.

Now that we know, I think we’re obligated to ask those next sets of questions and really understand it.”In recent years, studies have shown that even an increase of a few hundred parts per million of carbon dioxide in the air we breath causes people to test lower for cognitive skills. But until the latest study, pilots and airline cockpits hadn’t been examined.Normal levels in the atmosphere are 400 parts per million. Concentrations of the colorless, tasteless gas can rise in poorly ventilated spaces where people exhale it - such as crowded airliners..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}It’s clear we haven’t been thinking about it too deeply in terms of the impact on pilot performance. Now that we know, I think we’re obligated to ask those next sets of questions and really understand it.Joseph AllenCarbon dioxide levels reached as high as 1,400 parts per million on five percent of airline flights the European Aviation Safety Agency tested, according to data it released last year. The average was 603 parts per million, just slightly higher than levels found in the air.Airliners replenish oxygen in a plane at high altitudes by pulling in the thin air and pressurising it, mostly by scooping it from the front end of jet engines.No passports, more turbulence and standing cabins – 18 ways flying is going to changeBecause earlier studies showed people performed more poorly on tests of brain function at levels as low as 1,000 parts per million, the researchers thought it would make sense to examine pilot skills and carbon dioxide.Thirty airline pilots were recruited to fly multiple three-hour segments in a special flight simulator in which carbon dioxide levels could be manipulated.Performance on 21 manoeuvres ranging from making a steep turn to handling an emergency engine fire, decreased as carbon dioxide levels rose, according to the study.Flight examiners certified by the Federal Aviation Administration rated the pilots’ performance.At 700 parts per million, pilots were 69 percent more likely to correctly perform the manoeuvres compared to when they were breathing carbon dioxide at 2500 parts per million. At 1,500 parts per million, they were 52 percent more likely to pass compared to the higher level.The study was published Wednesday in the Journal of Exposure Science \u0026amp Environmental Epidemiology.Allen, who is also co-director of Harvard’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, took pains to say that air travel is extremely safe.How much have plane seats shrunk since the golden age of flying?There has been only one passenger death on a US-registered airline in more than nine years and there’s never been any evidence linking routine carbon dioxide levels to a crash.However, several of the few recent fatal accidents that have occurred involved puzzling lapses in pilot performance, according to accident investigation agencies. One example was when a captain on a Colgan Air flight made a series of abrupt manoeuvres in 2009 near Buffalo, causing a perfectly good commuter plane to plunge to the ground, killing 50.At the very least, Allen said, regulation agencies like the FAA might want to study the issue and compare the growing research on the effects of carbon dioxide with the existing US regulations on aircraft design.Britain urged to step up sanctions against \u0026#39corrupt\u0026#39 Russia in wake of US interventionBen Stokes wishes England cricket team good luck in Test he is missing ahead of giving

quake jolts indonesias lombok causing panic","story":"An Indonesian soldier and an official try to calm people shortly after an aftershock hits the area in Tanjung on Lombok island on August 9 A strong aftershock struck Indonesia\u0027s Lombok Thursday, causing panic among evacuees already traumatised by a devastating earthquake that killed more than 160 on the holiday island four days earlier.The 5.9-magnitude quake struck at a shallow depth in the northwest of the island, the US Geological Survey said, even as relief agencies raced to find survivors among the wreckage from Sunday\u0027s quake.It was the strongest of some 355 aftershocks that have rattled the island since Sunday, national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.Evacuees at a shelter in northern Lombok\u0027s Tanjung district ran out onto the road crying and screaming, an AFP reporter at the scene said.Motorcycles parked on the street toppled over and the walls of some nearby buildings collapsed.A woman wearing a motorbike helmet was seen crying with her two daughters in her arms.An Indonesian woman cries next to her children shortly after an aftershock hits the area in Tanjung on Lombok island on August 9We were stuck in the traffic while delivering aid, suddenly it felt like our car was hit from behind, it was so strong, witness Sri Laksmi told AFP.People in the street began to panic and got out of their cars, they ran in different directions in the middle of the traffic.The aftershock comes just four days after a devastating 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck Lombok, which relief agencies said had wiped out entire villages in the worst-hit regions in the north and west.An Indonesian man tries to calm a woman shortly after an aftershock hits the area in Tanjung on Lombok island on August 9 A total of 164 people were now confirmed dead in the quake, Nugroho told AFP, with a further 1,400 seriously injured and more than 150,000 displaced.State-run news agency Antara reported overnight 347 had been killed by the quake, but Nugroho said the tally was incomplete and unverified.However, he said Thursday the death toll has jumped significantly, without providing further details.Local authorities, international relief groups and the central government have begun organising aid, but shattered roads have slowed efforts to reach survivors in the mountainous north of Lombok, which bore the brunt of the quake.Aid begun trickling into some of the most isolated regions, officials said midday Thursday, but many people displaced by the quake still lack basic supplies.In some parts of northern Lombok, survivors can be seen standing on the road with cardboard boxes asking for donations and food.We are still waiting for assessments from some of the more remote areas in the north of the island, but it is already clear that Sunday\u0027s earthquake was exceptionally destructive, Christopher Rassi, the head of a Red Cross assessment team on Lombok, said in a statement.I visited villages yesterday that were completely collapsed.Members of an Indonesian search and rescue team look for victim of the recent quake in Tanjung on Lombok island on August 9Tens of thousands of homes, businesses and mosques were levelled by the quake, which struck on Sunday as evening prayers were being said across the Muslim-majority island.There are fears that two collapsed mosques in north Lombok had been filled with worshippers.Rescuers have found three bodies and also managed to pull one man alive from the twisted wreckage of one mosque in Lading Lading village, while at least one body has been spotted under the rubble in Pemenang.Authorities are gathering information from family members with missing relatives to determine how many more people may have been in the buildings when they collapsed, national search and rescue agency spokesman Yusuf Latif told AFP.Across much of the island, a popular tourist destination, once-bustling villages have been turned into virtual ghost towns.Many frightened villagers are staying under tents or tarpaulins dotted along roads or in parched rice fields, and makeshift medical facilities have been set up to treat the injured.Evacuees in some encampments say they are running out of food, while others are suffering psychological trauma after the powerful quake, which struck just one week after another tremor surged through the island and killed 17.There is a dire need for medical staff and long-term aid, especially food and medicine in the worst-hit areas, government officials said.Some evacuees have complained of being ignored or experiencing long delays for supplies to arrive at shelters.A man inspects the ruin of his house destroyed by an earthquake in North Lombok, IndonesiaThere has been no help at all here, said 36-year-old Multazam, staying with hundreds of others under tarpaulins on a dry paddy field outside West Pemenang village.We have no clean water, so if we want to go to the toilet we use a small river nearby, he said, adding they needed food, bedding and medicine.The Indonesian Red Cross said it had set up 10 mobile clinics in the north of the island.A field hospital has also been established near an evacuation centre catering to more than 500 people in the village of Tanjung.Kurniawan Eko Wibowo, a doctor at the field hospital, said most patients had broken bones and head injuries.We lack the infrastructure to perform operations because (they) need to be performed in a sterile place, Wibowo told AFP.Aid groups say children are particularly vulnerable, with many sleeping in open fields and suffering illnesses from lack of warm clothing and blankets.Please review our commenting policyBritain urged to step up sanctions against

rics","story":"Created with Sketch.Changes to tax on buy-to-let properties has led to a lack of new properties going on the rental marketClick to followThe Independent OnlineEast Anglia and the South West are set to see the biggest increasesUK rents are expected to rise by 15 per cent in the next five years due to a lack of supply, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ (RICS) has warned.The group said its July survey showed a continued reduction in new property being put on the market in the lettings sector, with 22 per cent more respondents reporting a fall, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of decline. This lack of available properties means rents are estimated to go up by almost 2 per cent across the UK this year, but RICS said “the shortfall in the supply pipeline is more visible over the medium term”, with rents predicted to rise 15 per cent by the middle of 2023. East Anglia and the South West are viewed as likely to see the sharpest growth over the period, RICS warned. The organisation said the lack of supply, which is “evident in virtually all parts of the country” was “symptomatic of the shift in the mood music in the buy-to-let market in the wake of tax changes which are still in the process of being implemented”. Tax relief for buy-to-let investors has been reduced, while stamp duty on second homes has increased in recent years.Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said: “The impact of recent and ongoing tax changes is clearly having a material impact on the Buy to Let sector as intended. The risk, as we have highlighted previously, is that a reduced pipeline of supply will gradually feed through into higher rents in the absence of either a significant uplift in the Build to Rent programme or government funded social housing. “At the present time, there is little evidence that either is likely to make up the shortfall. This augers ill for those many households for whom owner occupation is either out of reach financially or just not a suitable tenure.Abdul Choudhury, RICS London policy officer, said the survey showed the government must “urgently” look at the private rented sector and find ways to “encourage good landlords”.He said: “Ultimately, Government must consider the impact of its policies, and if the wish is to move away from PRS, it must provide a suitable alternative. If they wish to improve PRS, as we have suggested by professionalising through regulation and the PRS code, there is justification to reconsider the approach taken to tax.”Owning a home cheaper than renting in every part of UK, study findsLondon rents rising almost three times faster than wages Landlord offering \u0027sex for rent\u0027 says he is not breaking the lawResearch from think tank Centre for London released earlier this week showed the lack of affordable housing in the capital was a major factor causing people to leave the city. In its report, the group said: “The continuing affordability crisis and the prospect of Brexit are dampening the city’s appeal, with the former seen as driving the rise in the number of people in their mid-twenties to thirties leaving the capital.”buy to letEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/25/12/glasto-crop.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6345871  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Glastonbury The Movie (In Flashback)  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/25/12/glasto-crop.jpg","title":"demi lovato","story":"Created with Sketch.Singer has been recovering after she was reportedly found unresponsive at her home in Los Angeles last monthClick to followThe Independent CultureDemi Lovato releases statement after suspected drug overdose: \u0027I will keep fighting\u0027 Demi Lovato\u0026nbsphas issued her first statement after being taken to\u0026nbsphospital for a suspected drug overdose in July.\u0026nbspThis illness is not something that disappears or fades with time, she continued.

scientists\u0026nbspThe UK must maintain existing relationships with its European neighbours after\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspor face a serious decline in its scientific activities, the

funding\u0026nbspand over half the researchers working in the UK were born overseas.Scientists on both sides of the Channel broadly agree it is in everyone’s interest for the UK to maintain a similar level of cooperation with Europe following Brexit.But Dr\u0026nbspVallance\u0026nbspwarned that such future cooperation is not a “foregone conclusion”.In the meantime, he said it would also be important to look beyond Europe and forge more links with the US and Commonwealth nations to “renew our commitment to international collaboration”.He said: “Our nearest neighbours are outstanding

successful in our science.”He said the deal being pushed for by the government is striving for a system where science being conducted with our European neighbours is not interrupted.In a speech given in May at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, Theresa May said she valued this collaboration and wanted to retain full association with the EU’s proposed €100bn\u0026nbsp(£88.9m) research and innovation scheme – the successor to its Horizon 2020 programme.Woolaston calls for Brexit referendum to be re-runHowever, some have questioned the feasibility of retaining all of the current benefits enjoyed by the UK science community following Brexit.“We would share those aspirations, but we think there is a gap in how the government intends to deliver on them,” said Sue Ferns, deputy general secretary of scientists’ trade union Prospect.“Horizon 2020 was an important source of funding for many UK scientists – clearly the government wants to have access to the successor but the widespread expectation is that we will be paying more and getting less out.”Concerns also remain about the free movement of scientists and their families, and the UK has already parted ways with European collaborations such as the Euratom nuclear agency and the Galileo satellite programme.In an interview with The Independent, particle physicist and TV personality Professor Brian Cox said there is “no upside” to Brexit for UK science – a view that has been echoed by many important figures including the Royal Society president Venkatraman Ramakrishnan.Nevertheless, Dr Vallance said the government is pushing for the best deal possible for scientists.“Although there’s good will on both sides and the scientists want it, it is not a foregone conclusion ever until you’ve done it so we need to keep focused on that, and the prime minister is quite clear on what she wants from this,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our

Sketch.Click to followThe Independent OnlineIndian sailor stranded aboard ship in Great Yarmouth for 18 monthsAn Indian sailor was left stranded aboard a ship moored in Great Yarmouth for a year-and-a-half.Nikesh Rastogi is captain of the offshore supply vessel Malaviya Twenty, whose owners fell into liquidation,\u0026nbspleading to complex\u0026nbsplegal wrangling over unpaid crew wages and port dues.The 43-year-old seaman had not been paid since 2017, he said, and feared leaving the vessel in case he would lose out on the back pay.He and three other crew members worried that\u0026nbspif they left the ship\u0026nbspit would be “considered a derelict which means anybody can take it over”.Lawyers acting for the crew made representations to the Admiralty Marshal at the High Court in July and the ship has now been arrested, meaning the court can arrange to sell it and use the money for the sailors\u0027 wages.Capt Rastogi, from Mumbai, said he hopes to fly\u0026nbsphome with his colleagues within weeks.“It is like a weight being lifted because there was a point of no hope,” he said. “There was a period where things were really bad mentally.”Paul Haworth, a director at the law firm Birketts which represented the crew, said a surveyor instructed by the court will value the ship and the sale process should finish in September.Paul Keenan, an inspector from the International Transport Workers’ Federation, said the ship could be worth between £700,000 and\u0026nbsp£800,000.Mr Haworth said that should be enough to pay those involved in the negotiations, including the Admiralty Marshal’s costs, port dues, the crew’s unpaid wages and lawyers.He said a court order would be needed to sell the ship for less than its valuation price.The Malaviya Twenty has been in Great Yarmouth since June 2016.Capt Rastogi said he was contracted by an agency in February 2017 as part of a 13-strong replacement crew, after the ship’s owners fell into liquidation.All of his original crew returned to India last year, and three new crew members joined him in September 2017 on six-month contracts.Capt Rastogi said his employers withdrew in January 2018 after new contracts failed to materialise, and that he and his crewmates have not been paid since last year.He said the situation had been difficult but he felt responsible for his crew, adding “you can’t sit and mope over it, you just slide into the role”.The crew spent much of their time doing routine maintenance and performing drills and kept in touch with family at home on WhatsApp.UK

the European Union in 2016 has swung against Brexit, according to a new poll.A YouGov survey shows people in the southwest now oppose the UK’s departure amid the chaos of the negotiations and the mounting prospect of a no-deal Brexit.The poll – commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign for a fresh referendum – adds that a greater proportion of people want another chance to vote on Brexit, by a margin of 42 per cent to 35 per cent.Brexit and housing crisis combining to cause exodus from London \u0027No-deal\u0027 Brexit fears push sterling to 12-month lowA no-deal Brexit would be a

also comes as the president of the Royal Society and Nobel prize-winning biologist Venki Ramakrishnan warned that a no-deal Brexit would be devastating for the UK’s science industry.According to the YouGov\u0026nbsppoll, when respondents were asked how they would vote if a fresh referendum were to be held, 46 per cent said they would Remain a member of the EU, 43 per cent opted for Leave, 6 per cent replied “don’t know” and a further 6 per cent said they would not vote.When pollsters excluded the don’t knows and would not vote, 51 per cent said they would back Remain while 49 per cent believed Leave would be the best option.At the 2016 referendum around 53 per cent of voters in the southwest cast their ballot for Leave while 47 opted Remain.The region is particularly crucial for the Conservatives as it often cited as being crucial to David Cameron’s surprise majority victory at the 2015 general election as his party swept away seats from the Liberal Democrats, who lost all of their 15 MPs.And at the 2017 snap election Theresa May’s party held 47 seats in the southwest while losing four – three to Labour and one to the Liberal Democrats.Peter Kellner, the former YouGov president, said the poll is the first “significant test” of public opinion in the region on Brexit since the 2016 referendum and demonstrates that “attitudes are beginning to shift”.People\u0027s Vote

negotiations with the bloc are completed and 35 per cent said they would oppose it.But if the prime minister’s negotiations in Brussels break down and the UK has to choose between staying in the EU or leaving without a deal, 47 per cent said they would prefer a fresh public vote while 27 per cent opted to hand the decision to MPs.“Voters in the southwest support a People’s Vote on any final Brexit

This lack of available properties means rents are estimated to go up by almost 2 per cent across the UK this year, but RICS said “the shortfall in the supply pipeline is more visible over the medium term”, with rents predicted to rise 15 per cent by the middle of 2023. East Anglia and the South West are viewed as likely to see the sharpest growth over the period, RICS warned. The organisation said the lack of supply, which is “evident in virtually all parts of the country” was “symptomatic of the shift in the mood music in the buy-to-let market in the wake of tax changes which are still in the process of being implemented”. Tax relief for buy-to-let investors has been reduced, while stamp duty on second homes has increased in recent years.Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said: “The impact of recent and ongoing tax changes is clearly having a material impact on the Buy to Let sector as intended. The risk, as we have highlighted previously, is that a reduced pipeline of supply will gradually feed through into higher rents in the absence of either a significant uplift in the Build to Rent programme or government funded social housing. “At the present time, there is little evidence that either is likely to make up the shortfall. This augers ill for those many households for whom owner occupation is either out of reach financially or just not a suitable tenure.Abdul Choudhury, RICS London policy officer, said the survey showed the government must “urgently” look at the private rented sector and find ways to “encourage good landlords”.He said: “Ultimately, Government must consider the impact of its policies, and if the wish is to move away from PRS, it must provide a suitable alternative. If they wish to improve PRS, as we have suggested by professionalising through regulation and the PRS code, there is justification to reconsider the approach taken to tax.”Owning a home cheaper than renting in every part of UK, study findsLondon rents rising almost three times faster than wages Landlord offering \u0027sex for rent\u0027 says he is not breaking the lawResearch from think tank Centre for London released earlier this week showed the lack of affordable housing in the capital was a major factor causing people to leave the city.

Indonesia earthquake: SHOCKING footage shows people in hospital beds10.35am update: NASA satellite map shows new ground deformation after Bali quakeScientists from NASA used new satellite data to produce a map of ground deformation on Lombok, Indonesia, following the deadly 6.9-magnitude earthquake on August 5.Using Caltech\u0027s Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis project (ARIA), the experts created a map which shows the amount of permanent surface movement that occurred.This is believed to be almost entirely due to the quake, over a six-day period between satellite images taken on July 30 and August 5.From the pattern found in the map, scientists determined the earthquake fault slip was on a fault beneath the northwestern part of Lombok Island.And the quake caused as much as 10 inches (25cm) of uplift of the ground surface.White areas in the image are places where the radar measurement was not possible, largely due to dense forests in the middle of the islands.Bali earthquake NASA map: Lombok\u0027s landscape has been changed by the tremors (Image: NASA)10.20am update: Aid efforts are being hampered by landslides and debrisHusni Husni from the Red Cross told US network CNN: \u0026ldquoWe are concerned aid trucks can\u0026rsquot get through because of the debris and there are also landslides happening.\u0026ldquoA lot of people are displaced, and many have migrated to the hilly and mountainous areas because of fear of a tsunami.Fellow Red Cross official Christopher Wrassi added: We are still waiting for assessments from some of the more remote areas in the north of the island, but it is already clear that Sunday\u0027s earthquake was exceptionally destructive.I visited villages yesterday that were completely collapsed.10.00am update: Dozens of earthquakes and tremors hit the popular tourist hotspotDuring the last seven days, a total of 20 earthquakes have hit the region according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).Since Sunday\u0027s 6.9-magnitude quake, a number of earthquakes have hit the embattled region, clustering around the northwestern coast.Some of just 4.1 magnitude but others ranging from 5.3, 5.5 and 5.9-magnitude this morning.8.05am update: USGS says earthquake measured 5.9 on Richter scale\u0026nbspIndonesia\u0026rsquos disaster agency said the quake caused damage to buildings and sent people out in the streets in panic.He wrote on Twitter: \u0026ldquoPeople are more traumatised by the earthquake.The quake struck not far from the epicentre of Sunday\u0027s magnitude 6.9 tremor, which has claimed the lives of 347 people.Lombok earthquake latest: The earthquake hit at 12.25pm local time at depth of 10km (Image: USGS)7.49am update: Aftershocks felt in Bali Aftershocks from the 5.9 earthquake were felt in Bali this morning.Holidaymakers in the area have been evacuated from the Gili Islands after the first 6.9 earthquake hit Lombok on Monday. 7.40am update: A humanitarian crisis is looming in LombokThousands have been left homeless and in desperate need of clean water, food, medicine and shelter.Authorities made announcements over loudspeakers at evacuation sites after Thursday\u0027s quake, urging people to remain calm and stay inside tents or find open space if they were inside or near buildings.Please stay calm, this is just an aftershock and it will be over soon, there\u0027s no need to be scared, one official announced in a calm voice.7.32am update: Another HUGE earthquake hits Lombok - measuring 5.9 magnitude.

Unfortunately, for many young Muslims in Britain today this promise is being broken.“Young Muslims themselves identify cultural barriers in their communities and discrimination in the education system and labour market as some of the principal obstacles that stand in their way.“Young Muslim women face a specific challenge to maintain their identity while seeking to succeed in modern Britain.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fine. But this leopard is not about to change his spots.Throughout his life he has shown terrible judgment. It is extraordinary how often he picks the wrong side.He is not just a threat to British Jews if he gets into power.He’s a threat to Britain, full stop.BRUSSELS bureaucrats always put their precious project ahead of common sense.It explains their approach to Brexit negotiations.Yet our analysis of what a ‘no deal’ Brexit would mean for French pharmaceutical companies, German car manufacturers and everything in between should focus minds.You can’t just find £500 billion down the back of the sofa, Jean-Claude.The Brexit Department has its own detailed study too, but are keeping it private.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM has — finally — started to talk to them with a concrete plan.The silence after her meeting with Emmanuel Macron is concerning, but the noises from German business leaders and politicians from the Continent in recent weeks are more promising.As the clock ticks, it’s time for them to tell Brussels that the theatrics and the anti-Britain briefings have to end. The Chequers fudge is not perfect. But Brussels would be mad to knock it back.And if they do? Planning is already stepping up for a clean-break Brexit.The PM still believes no deal is better than a bad deal and insists she’s ready to walk away.And that, as President Trump knows, is The Art Of The Deal…AND so another new front opens up in the war against the motorist.It’s outrageous that companies in some parts of the country could be charged if their employees drive to work.Those firms, who have already paid business rates for having a car park, will just pass on the extra cost to workers. Another stealth tax, another pocket emptied.We wouldn’t mind so much if we believed the money would be ploughed back into the roads, getting rid of potholes and fixing rocky road surfaces. Or if the trains turned up when they’re supposed to.But we won’t hold our breath.POLICE unions never fail to complain about overwork and stress on the job.We can understand why. It’s not an easy job. Coppers have our respect.But the news that one in 12 have second jobs suggests that not all of the wailing about long hours and working conditions are entirely legitimate.The next time a victim is told there’s nobody available to investigate, they might wonder what their local bobbies are up to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wasn’t surprised I choked on my toast because anything bad that happens to me — big or small — I’ve already lived through in my imagination.But I choked at the sheer obviousness of the scientists’ conclusions. Of course feeling stressed helps people deal with bad news. What next? Scientists discover sleep is related to tiredness?I can deal with bad news better because I’ve already been in that moment. I’m well prepared because I’ve actually lived it in my head.Anyway, the choking passed and, to my surprise, I didn’t die. That’s another beauty of always believing the worst will happen. What a wonderful surprise it is when the worst doesn’t happen.The toast didn’t kill me. I cheated the choke. Oh, the joy.I don’t know how long I’ve been this way. It’s definitely been going on since I was a kid.I remember flying off on holiday to what was then Yugoslavia with my mum and dad. I recall my mum trying to talk to me about all the exciting things we’d be doing when we got to my nan’s house on the Adriatic.I kept shaking my head and not saying anything and she got annoyed and rolled her eyes, thinking I just wasn’t looking forward to our holiday.But she misunderstood me. I didn’t want to think about the nice things we’d be doing because I was so convinced the plane was going to crash that it made me sad to consider what I surely wouldn’t experience.Imagine, then, my joy when the plane didn’t actually crash and I ended up not dying. What a bonus!And I went in the sea and didn’t drown — another nice surprise.I almost look forward to the moment when I do croak. If I have any warning I’ll tut and say to myself, “Oh well, I knew this would happen sooner or later.”This kind of attitude is admittedly a disaster when it comes to wooing women. Assuming total failure ahead of any move made on the opposite sex is disastrous. It’s just not attractive.I’ve a friend who simply cannot imagine why any woman in the world wouldn’t desire him.Consequently, many women do desire him. I, on the other hand, simply cannot imagine why any woman would desire me. Consequently, they invariably don’t. But because I knew they wouldn’t, I’m not remotely downhearted.I’ve kept the company of positive people over the years. They have their uses. But expecting me to believe them when they say, “Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine”, is fanciful.And believing that from professional advisers can be absolutely calamitous.“Oh yes, Adrian, it’s all going to be fine.” And then, whatever it is, turns out not to be fine and they just shrug and say, “Oh dear, didn’t see that coming, pay me some more fees and I’ll make sure it’ll be all right in the end.”In my work as a journalist I’ve talked to many psychologists who speak of the power of positive thinking. Yeah, whatever. Maybe. But what I do know for sure is that I just can’t do it.When you’re standing on a golf course with a club in your hand addressing the ball, you’re supposed to envisage your perfect shot. For me, impossible.What I actually envisage, with complete clarity, is a truly dreadful shot.I can actually hear the ball smacking on to trees, or plopping into water. I’m living in the calamity.So at least when it happens, which is often, I can shrug and say, “Hmm, thought so.”All this may stem from supporting a team like West Bromwich Albion. I once told a priest, in all seriousness, that I suffered from deep despondence.When he asked me why I thought this was, I told him (as a joke) who I supported. He nodded gravely and said, “Yes, I see, I see.”I have a friend I travel with on the supporters’ coaches to away matches. The poor chap always thinks we’re going to win. Even at 2-0 down at half-time he’ll be sure we’ll emerge victorious.I challenged him once about these absurd delusions and he said: “Look, we all have the same journey home after a game. If we’ve won we’re both happy, if we lose we’re both sad. The difference is that I’ve had a much more enjoyable journey there than you.”That convinced me for a while. So the next game I tried being positive.And we lost. And it hurt more. So I went back to how I was.There’s only one route to happiness I can think of and it’s to be found in the lyrics of a song by the late Mose Allison: “I don’t worry ’bout a thing, ’cos I know nothing’s going to be alright.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it.

Disgraceful.Although there was an uproar among the residents, a lot of people stuck up for the drivers because the roadworks can be an inconvenience.Lisa Waller wrote on Facebook: No defence for the drivers, but maybe show a little urgency in the works so people dont feel the need to off-road it across the fields.Liam Donovan added: If its a main used road with no close by diversion sign dont close the whole road down, work on one side then when you have finished work on the other you can keep the traffic going - its been done many times.What do you expect. Today I drove past an open barrier saying road closed, to find the work being done on one side.Other people was diverting for no reason you have got to chance it sometimes because 80 per cent of times it says road closed it nothing turns out to be happening.No offence to the workers though, this is just what I come across on a daily driving job.And one person particularly stuck up for the drivers, as Renier Jansen wrote: Love it!

Temperatures will fall off a cliff.“A huge atmospheric block prevented the jet stream from delivering wet weather from the Atlantic – but that block has finally been dislodged, and further weather systems will arrive.”A Met Office forecaster said: “It is turning cooler as the jet stream is diving south, steering progressively cooler air from Greenland and Iceland towards western Europe.“From Sunday to August 21, temperatures will generally be around normal.Spells of rain or showers are likely to push southeastwards.“From August 22 to September 5, the North of the UK is likely to see the driest weather.Temperatures are likely to be above normal, and many areas may become warm or very warm.”The Met Office said much hotter-than-normal UK conditions over the three months until the end of October are a huge 11 times more likely than much cooler conditions.The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The Met Office forecast is astonishing.“September has 27C possible in Scotland, and even warm temperatures into October.”The Met Office three-month forecast said: “For August-October, the probability the UK average temperature will fall into the warmest of our five categories is around 55 per cent.The coldest of our five categories is less than 5 per cent.”This year is twice as likely as usual to have the hottest August to October period since before 1981, the Met Office forecast shows, due to more warm high pressure forecast."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425478167.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"storm tornado sunset amazing entries weather photographer competition","story":"Arranged by the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) and AccuWeather, the deadline for entries was on June 5.“Weather impacts everything we do,” said Brian Lavery, Managing Director, Europe for AccuWeather.“We have seen countless examples of how and when the Superior Accuracy of our forecasts kept people safe and out of harm’s way.“I’m looking forward to seeing these captured moments that illustrate how we live alongside nature.”In what is the third edition of the photography competition, entries have come flooding in from across the world, with amateurs and professionals capturing the very best of Mother Nature.Images sent in for consideration included weather phenomena like stunning cloud formations, crisp lightening strikes and awe-inspiring sunsets.A mirror image of sunrise at Worthing Pier by Steven PastonThe overall winner of the competition will receive a £500 cash prize, an Olympus TG-5 Tough camera and one years membership to the Royal Meteorological Society."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425529923.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa mays public sector wage hikes leaves tens of thousands of public sector workers with less take home pay","story":"Experts last night said nurses and teachers were among those facing huge disappointment despite increases billed as the “biggest for a decade” by the Government just weeks ago.The pay hikes have moved certain workers into a higher pension contribution band – meaning the state takes more towards their retirement.Insurer Royal London said an employee on £26,500 who gets a 2 per cent pay hike could have as much as £146 a year less in their pocket to spend because their pension contributions move from 7.1 per cent to 9.3 per cent.One NHS source said a number of young nurses were shocked to see their most recent pay packet go DOWN.Others had seen an increase of as little as 60p a month.She said: “People recognise the NHS pension is a rare golden one.“But for many young families this has impacted their current lives. No one mentioned the wider implications of this pay rise.”The revelation comes just a day after the BMA union warned that 90 per cent of doctors were unhappy with their pay deal.Theresa May ripped up the seven-year public sector pay cap earlier this year by awarding NHS staff a 6 per cent pay rise over 3 years.Big hikes of up to 3.5 per cent were then announced for doctors, teachers, prison guards, police officers and the Armed Forces last month.Steve Webb, the ex-Lib Dem pensions minister and now Royal London policy chief, said: “Millions of nurses, teachers and other public servants have faced nearly a decade of pay squeezes and will have believed that things were finally going to get better.“It was unforgiveable not to explain that increased pension contributions could mean some of them would actually be worse off following the new pay deal.”A Treasury spokesman last night said: “It’s right that as workers earn more money they contribute a bit more towards their public sector pensions – which continue to be some of the most generous pensions available.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sources told The Sun the motion may also demand Labour then campaign “to remain in the EU”.Some 130 constituency Labour parties (CLPs) are already though to be supporting the move.Critically the push is backed by union leaders – including TSSA chief Manuel Cortes. Sources claim Momentum co-founder Jon Lansmann is also supporting the idea.A source told The Sun: “An overwhelming number of Labour members and voters are fed up with Brexit. We believe a substantial number want the party to face up to Brexit extremists.”Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly refused to rule out a second Referendum – with aides merely saying it is not current Labour policy.But Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer last month said Labour could back a ‘People’s Vote’ if MPs reject Theresa May’s final deal with Brussels.At the time, he said: “In those circumstances it seems to me the sensible thing is to keep all our options on the table.”Union powerbroker Len McCluskey – the head of Labour donor Unite – last month said he was “open to the possibility” of a second vote.Labour opens the floor to motions by party members and activists on the Sunday of its annual conference.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep. She spends thousands every month getting her nails done so they look really chavvy.And then there’s the periodic scaffolding required to keep those vast mammaries aloft – plus a bit of pointing and retiling.The surprise to me was how in the name of hell she managed to amass £45million, not how she managed to spend it.For doing WHAT exactly?A woman on a flight from Valencia to London apparently “bonded” with a “hot guy”.Now Jo Lia has launched a Facebook campaign to trace the poor bugger.She says he was called “Joe” and looked a bit like Jordan Henderson.

Clearly Labour has no intention of kicking out its Jew-haters.So I would suggest everyone in the party who ISN’T anti-Semitic get the hell out right now.And leave the party to the racist, hard-left rabble who are currently running it.The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig says that people mistake her for Tom Cruise.It’s easy to see why, isn’t it?

But it was just me, nipping out for some fags.Our former Foreign Secretary is in trouble for having said that Muslim women wearing the full burka look like postboxes, or bank robbers.But that’s pretty much what most think, isn’t it?Boris was against banning the burka. But increasingly I think we should follow most of our European friends and outlaw the ridiculous garment in public places.Almost half of British 18 to 24 year olds don’t know when World War One took place, according to a survey.And hardly any of them could name the prime minister – David Lloyd George – who led us to victory.But it’s not really their fault, is it? Truth is, they’re not taught stuff like this any more.The history curriculum has been pretty much stripped of things which shows Britain in a good light, or British people being the victims of aggression.Instead, they learn very dubious arguments about slavery and colonialism.It’s a dangerous thing. When you lose a sense of pride in your nation, you also start to lose respect for its authority and its laws.And you raise a generation of perpetually whining airheads who understand nothing of the sacrifices made by Britons in the past.YOU see? They take their dieting really seriously up here in the North East. Pizza, chicken and chips. My missus took this pic, above, in a Teesside café.She once spent two weeks trying to find a salad in Austria, with no luck.The BBC is about to spend more than two million quid on a propaganda campaign to make you pay its licence fee.This is as opposed to the rest of its budget, which is spent on a propaganda campaign to convince you that all immigration is good, Israel is evil and Brexit a catastrophe.Fewer and fewer people watch the BBC.The licence fee has become an absurdity – an unjust tax which growing numbers of people simply refuse to pay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We couldnt believe it.Its disgusting. I cant believe we have been living next door to that.Three men - including two near neighbours - have been arrested on suspicion of his murder.Gaut was rehoused in the small ground floor flat by Caerphilly council.Another neighbour said: The flat where it happened is owned by the council, theyre always moving people in and out of them.Who wants to live next door to a child killer or a paedo?The flat and three neighbouring properties were sealed off as cops combed the area for clues.Gaut, then 21, was jailed for life in July 1985 for the murder and torture of a 17-month old boy just 11 miles away in Caerphilly.The beast was babysitting his girlfriends son Chi Ming Shek - known as Marky Pickthall - when he battered, kicked and burned the sole of the childs foot.The babys mum Jane Pickthall, then 23, had been out drinking and left Gaut to look after her two young children.She arrived home in Caerphilly and had sex with Gaut.But the next day she found her sons dead body under a chest of drawers in his bedroom.A murder trial at Cardiff Crown Court heard Gaut tried to make the death look accidental.The baby died of multiple injuries including a broken arm, injured liver and spleen and a fractured skull.A judge described the murder as the worst crime in the land.Sentencing, Mr Justice Caldfield said: The person murdered was a defenceless little baby and on the furys finding you not only murdered that child but also tortured him.Police say Gauts next of kin has been informed and enquiries are continuing.The child killers body was discovered around 3pm on Saturday.A Gwent Police spokesman said: The cause of death has yet to be established and will be determined following a post mortem examination.A spokesman for Caerphilly council said: We can confirm it is a council property and we are helping police with their inquiries.As it is an on-going inquiry it would not be appropriate to comment further."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425510143.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"gatwick love darling complaint","story":"Bosses said the terms are unprofessional despite being widely used as friendly way of talking to someone.The ban was outlined in a memo by contractor Wilson James, which provides special assistance services to passengers.It stated: “If you do not know the name of the person you are speaking with please refer to them as Sir or Madam.“We are in a customer-facing environment and must remain professional at all times.”But the censure has not gone down well with staff, who accused bosses of over-reacting.One told The Sun: “How small-minded to write a memo like this.

The ultimate mistake was a droplet of water between my eye and my contact lens. It could blind me, or even kill me one day.Despite years of treatment, I still have this parasite in my eye.I am told that it is dormant. It goes into this stage to protect itself, picture it curling into a ball.We will never be able to tell whether it is dead or not or if and when it may reawaken so I have to live with the feeling of never knowing.Skye started to have symptoms of ME, an incurable condition, just a month after coming off the medication doctors prescribed to treat her eye problem.The neurological condition causes extreme exhaustion, pain, brain fog, among a variety of other symptoms.She said: The fatigue is like no other - I actually wish there was another name for it.You cant muster up the energy to put on foot in front of the other.You cant get dressed and ready for the day without a blackness descending over your eyes. You cant carry a conversation let alone even speak.The bottom of the line is that there is no energy there in the first place to channel through your body to all the right places. The only thing you can do is lie and exist.Skye added: My life has been ripped to pieces and then burnt down into nothing but ash and smoke. My life was planned out.I lay in the dark because of light sensitivity alone and waiting for someone to return home and take me to the toilet.My bed is my world. My bed is my support. It has seen me through endless days of torturous pain, fatigue and inner turmoil.Rosie Halsall, 17, from Liverpool, also suffers from ME and was diagnosed just aged nine leaving her wheelchair-bound.At her worst, she was unable to lift her head from her pillow, was spoon-fed and unable to sit for more than 30 minutes without fainting.She said: ME has changed my life. I cant sleep in my bedroom, instead in a downstairs room. Im sensitive to lights and sounds, so regularly wear sound reduction headphones and sunglasses- particularly on bad days.People dont tend to see the bad days, the days when Im crying in pain, when Im too exhausted to wear proper clothes, and the help I need from my parents with washing myself.Both teens have decided to speak out in support of Severe ME Awareness Day and to raise awareness of the condition.A spokesman for the ME Association said: It is an invisible illness. When you see us, we might not always look ill, but when our symptoms flare, the effects are obvious.It can feel like a constant flu, the smallest exertion can floor us, our bodies are painfully sore, restful sleep eludes us, light and noise are intolerable, and brain fog causes confusion.There is no known cure and no effective treatment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000422732452.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"majorca mansion vandalism michael oleary","story":"Vandals struck amid industrial action by the budget airline’s pilots over pay and conditions which hit flights to and from the Spanish isle.More walkouts expected to affect thousands of holidaymakers are due to take place on Friday.One message reads “Solidarity with Ryanair workers” while another says: “Michael O’Leary.

My son had the badge but it was taken away when he was fidgeting in class but that was because they’d taken his fidget spinner off him.The 34-year-old mum - whose son Mika, seven, is still at the school - has launched a petition to get rid of the badges.Other parents have spoken out, with one writing on Facebook: Everyone paid the same amount to do the same fun day. How very wrong is it to punish a child on a fun day when they have already been punished beforehand. Even prisons don’t punish you twice.... imagine getting ten years for a crime and then two days before you get out they give you another ten years.”The schools head teacher Nicola Haddock defended the decision, saying all children had at least two-and-a-half hours on the play equipment.Ms Haddock said: The Year 6 fun day, funded by both parents and our Parent Teacher Association, is a celebration for all of our children. While the children rightly recognised for their continued good behaviour over the school year were given the first place on the inflatables, this was not at the cost of the other children. They had a choice of other activities and time on the inflatables and, with all of our pupils, had equal access to ice-cream.I have investigated the concerns from the parents who have approached the school, as I do with any parental concern, and responded to them personally apologising for any shortcomings they may have felt happened on this day. I will, as always, review the school’s practices in light of parents’ feedback."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425625285.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"treasure hunder darrell miklos ufo bermuda triangle","story":"Darrell Miklos uses secret maps created by his ex-NASA astronaut pal Gordon Cooper to unearth shipwrecks in the briny deep.But during one of these trawls, intrepid explorer Darrell stumbled across huge mysterious structures that he thinks could change how we view our place in the universe forever.The huge unidentified submerged spaceship is covered in 15 unusual protrusions — which Darrell describes as unlike anything I have ever seen.Darrell, who will show off his other-worldly find on his Discovery Channel show Coopers Treasure, told MailOnline: It was also something that was completely different from anything that Ive seen that was made by nature.The mystery objects were found lying on the seabed near the Bahamas — within the notorious 1.3million km watery grave known as the Bermuda Triangle.It is the scene of countless strange disappearances of planes and ships — attached to which are curious tales that some discredit as myth but others say point to extra-terrestrial or even paranormal happenings.Veteran diver Darrell made his mammoth discovery during a hunt for the wreck of English ships related to the 16th century Brit sea captain Sir Francis Drake.But using maps designed in the 1960s by astronaut Cooper, Darrell detected more than 100 magnetic anomalies at an undisclosed location deep in the Caribbean waters. Describing his approach to his latest find, Darrell said: I was trying to identify shipwreck material based on one of the anomaly readings on Gordons charts when I noticed something that stuck out, that shocked me.He said the object has the appearance of a battleship with a steep wall from which five protruding arms stick out like cannons.Using special breathing apparatus to reach the 300ft-deep spaceship, Darrell said he and his fellow divers noticed that it did not appear to be man-made.And the fact it was covered in thick coral suggested the object — if it landed there from beyond our planet — did so hundreds if not thousands of years ago.Darrell added: Certainly nothing Ive ever seen based on my experience - and I have years of experience at doing this, weve identified multiple different types of shipwreck material - this doesnt match or look anything like that.Looking back at the Cooper charts, Darrell came across a puzzling note left by the former spaceman at the site of the structure — unidentified object.Now, Californian Darrell wants to investigate the mysterious site further — despite the risk he faces of being dubbed an alien conspiracy theorist.The Bermuda Triangle lies in a section of the North Atlantic Ocean which covers a vast area of 440,000 miles of sea.Its one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, with vessels crossing through to get to ports in America, Europe and the Caribbean.Nicknamed the Devils Triangle it has been blamed for the disappearance of dozens of planes and ships over the past 100 years.When Columbus sailed on his first voyage to the New World, he reported a great flame of fire crashed into the sea one night and that a strange light appeared in the distance a few weeks later.However, reports of unexplained disappearances did not really capture the public’s attention until the 20th century when the USS Cyclops, a 542-foot-long Navy cargo ship with over 300 men on-board, sank somewhere between Barbados and the Chesapeake Bay.One of the most famous mysteries was the disappearance of Flight 19 when five Avenger Torpedo Bombers vanished over the Triangle on December 5, 1945.All 14 men on the flight disappeared without a trace and a Martin Mariner Flying Boat also vanished during the search with 13 men on board.At least 1,000 lives have been lost in the last 100 years. On average, four aircraft and 20 yachts go missing in the area every year.Theories about the Trinagles strange occurences include UFO abductions, a shield to guard the lost city of Atlantis and sinister secret government testing. He wants to remain neutral until he can dig up more evidence on what the structure could be and is hoping to have a third series of his Discovery show commissioned to help tell the story.Hopeful Darrell added: I want to see what it is, because it may be nature-made, just a freak of nature.But given its placement in this particular part of the Caribbean and given what Gordon has told me about visitors from another planet and the things that Ive seen, I think its definitely worthwhile investigating.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

were pulled over for driving erratically.They wrote: We feel it necessary to show the other side of this horrible drug.We feel we need to be a voice for the children caught up in this horrible mess.This child cant speak for himself but we are hopeful his story can convince another user to think twice about injecting this poison while having a child in their custody.Just weeks later, Florida cops wearing bodycams found two mums overdosing on heroin in a car while their babies were the back seat.Kristen Leigh O’Connor, 27, of Coral Springs and June Ann Schweinhart, 28, of Lake Worth, were found slumped unconscious in a heroin stupor, with their newborns strapped in the back of the vehicle.Both were charged with child neglect and the children were taken into social services.US deaths from drug overdoses rose 21 per cent in 2016, and have significantly contributed to the decline in life expectancy in America.For the first time, the powerful painkiller Fentanyl and its close opioid cousins were a bigger factor in the deaths than any other legal or illegal drug, surpassing prescription pain pills and heroin.Two-thirds of the 42,000  drug deaths in 2016 involved opioids, a category that includes heroin, methadone, prescription pain pills like OxyContin, and Fentanyl.The highest drug death rates were recorded in ages 25 to 54."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425566067.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"staithes cliffs north yorkshire beach","story":"Emergency services

At least 15 senior Tory figures have demanded he apologise. But the former Foreign Secretary has defied Theresa May by refusing to say sorry for his remarks. In the piece, Mr Johnson argued against Denmark banning the burka. But he made several comparisons between the covering worn by some women, saying it made them look like “bank robbers” or “letter boxes”. Mr Johnson also revealed he would “feel entitled” to ask a woman wearing the burka to remove it if she came to his constituency office. Here\u0027s how top Tories have reacted to the comments.  Theresa May  Prime Minister   I do think that we all have to be very careful about the language and terms we use. And some of the terms Boris used describing people\u0027s appearance obviously have offended. So I agree with Brandon Lewis. What\u0027s important is do we believe people should have the right to practise their religion and, in the case of women and the burka and niqab, to choose how they dress. I believe women should be able to choose how they dress. Brandon Lewis  Conservative Party chair   “I do think Boris should apologise. I do agree with Boris we should be able to have a debate but we’ve got to be sure to use the right language.” Ruth Davidson  Conservative Party Scotland leader   I think it\u0027s also not been shown through history that when men make sweeping statements about what women should or shouldn\u0027t wear that it goes well for them. I think that this wasn\u0027t an off-the-cuff slip, he wrote a column, he knew exactly what he was doing and I think it crossed from being provocative and starting a debate and actually it became rude and gratuitous. I think he should apologise for them. It doesn\u0027t bode well, and we\u0027ve seen it in the arguments and the debate over anti-Semitism in Labour, of how we\u0027ve got to a point in 2018 where we\u0027re supposed to be so much better at accepting and discussing and being open about different faiths, religions, backgrounds, social classes, all of these things, and actually we\u0027ve become slightly even more siloed and treating them differently. If you use the analogy of Christianity, would you ever write in the  that you should have a debate about banning Christians from wearing crucifixes?  It\u0027s the same argument but it\u0027s in a different faith so why are the parameters different for one faith and not the other? That\u0027s where I think you start getting these questions of what constitutes anti-Semitism, what constitutes Islamophobia, and if you have that comparator in your mind then that perhaps is a better guidance for not what you should or shouldn\u0027t say, but how you frame the debate. I agree with the point of his piece which was you shouldn\u0027t ban the burka, the niqab, the hijab - I don\u0027t think we should ban it - but what he said was a gratuitously offensive way of saying it. Jeremy Wright  Culture Secretary   When you are discussing a subject such as this, then I think describing it as people looking like letter boxes isn\u0027t helpful. I think we should all choose our language with care. That\u0027s the sort of language I think we should try and avoid using. Alistair Burt  Foreign Office Minister   “I would never have made such a comment. I think there’s a degree of offence in that, absolutely right.” Tobias Ellwood  Armed Forces Minister   Boris has many talents, but his attack on Muslim women for their appearance is not the way to defend freedom of religion. Now more than ever, we must communicate the integrity \u0026amp inclusiveness of the Conservative Party. Penny Mordaunt  Equalities Minister   Brandon Lewis has done the right thing. Remember only two things are the case: either a woman wants to wear the niqab, or she does not. If you want to support women who do not want to wear the niqab I recommend giving Masih Alinejad and others a follow. Dominic Grieve  former Attorney General   If he were to become leader of the party, I for one wouldn\u0027t be in it. I don\u0027t regard him as a fit and proper person to lead a political party and certainly not the Conservative Party. He is somebody who seems to me to pursue an agenda that is entirely self-referential, doesn\u0027t take account of colleagues. He wasn\u0027t able to observe Cabinet responsibility when he was in government. Lord Sheikh  Conservative Muslim Forum president   Take the whip from him. Why not? He\u0027s not a super human being, he\u0027s a member of the party. The party chairman, the Prime Minister has the right to take the whip. That\u0027s the thing I\u0027d like to see. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi  former Conservative Party chair   As a feminist, what really disgusts me in this whole episode is that Muslim women are simply political fodder, their lives a convenient battleground on which to stake out a leadership bid. Boris Johnson’s contempt for Muslim women is part of a dangerous pattern. “Well, this approach is not just offensive, it’s dangerous. Johnson’s words have once again validated the view of those that ‘other’ Muslims. They send out a message that Muslim women are fair game. “What starts as useful targets for ‘colourful political language’ and the odd bit of toxic campaigning ends up in attacks on our streets. “Muslim women should not be a useful political battleground for Old Etonians. “It is crass and it must stop, and it must be condemned by the leadership right from the Prime Minister down.” Lord Eric Pickles  former Conservative Party chair   There are tensions now that exist within the community, a degree of hatred out there that I\u0027ve not witnessed for a good few years. If this was a councillor from Scunthorpe or Middlesbrough or somewhere I\u0027m not entirely sure he would have been given the amount of slack and, in truth, he wouldn\u0027t have been given the amount of attention, that Boris has got. Paul Masterton  Conservative MP   “No one is shutting down debate. “They are pointing out it’s possible to argue for empowerment and religious freedom of women and girls, come to the view you are against a ban on the burqa in public places (as he did), all without mocking women who do wear one for their appearance. Heidi Allen  Conservative MP   “About as suitable to be Prime Minister as he was Foreign Secretary.” Anna Soubry  Conservative MP   Boris Johnson\u0027s comments on what some Muslim women choose to wear are offensive - in my honest opinion they fuel Islamaphobia.

Just 7,245 new affordable homes to buy were funded by the government last year - down from 20,298 in 2009/10. Official figures show the number of those homes completed fell for four years in a row after the Tories took power, and hit a low point of 4,280 in 2015/16. It comes despite Theresa May declaring in January that it was her “personal mission to restore the dream of home-ownership”. Labour claimed 77,000 fewer affordable homes to buy had been built than if construction had continued at the 2009/10 rate.  Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said: “Theresa May and the Conservatives have talked big but delivered little for those locked out of home-ownership. “Ministers have slashed direct help for first-time buyers on middle incomes by cutting funding for low-cost homes such as shared ownership.” The figures are for affordable homes to buy that were funded by either Homes England or the Greater London Authority. They mainly cover “shared ownership” homes, where buyers take out a mortgage on part of their property and pay rent on the rest. Some 20,298 were completed in 2009/10, the earliest year for which figures were available - followed by 16,726 in 2010/11, 15,144 in 2011/12, 14,753 in 2012/13, 8,710 in 2013/14, 12,257 in 2014/15, 4,280 in 2015/16, 5,864 in 2016/17 and 7,245 in 2017/18. It comes after a Chartered Institute of Housing report in May found government investment in affordable housing had been slashed from \u0026pound4.2bn in 2009/10 to \u0026pound483m in 2016/17.

The Football Association says it would plough a windfall into grassroots sport for 20 years. But there are other, better ways to do this. As the Premier League kicks off this weekend, it continues to receive at least \u0026pound3billion from domestic and overseas TV rights. It’s not hard to see how England’s richest clubs have so much money to share around between themselves. So the FA should be demanding the government introduce a levy of 10% on the TV income Premier League clubs receive.  This would help nurture the next generation of Harry Kanes, Jordan Pickfords, and Kieron Trippiers. Grassroots football in England is, unfortunately, not as healthy as the Premier League\u0027s prize pot. Only one in three grass pitches are of adequate quality to play football in England, and last season one in six matches were cancelled due to poor facilities. Meanwhile taxpayers paid out more than \u0026pound160million to build Wembley. So any decision to sell off this nationally important venue should not be taken before other alternatives have been exhausted. The Premier League currently puts just \u0026pound100million into grassroots football- a pitiful contribution given how wealthy its clubs are.

The honourable Member of Parliament for Boris Johnson is considering his next move. The Opposition is making headlines by chewing its own entrails over whether or not it likes Jews. The country is stockpiling food and medicines, while grass fires rage, cows go hungry and farmers talk of disaster. To make matters worse, he is being made to look incompetent by Jeremy Hunt, of all people, and Jacob Rees-Mogg is being spoken of as the next Prime Minister because he sounds clever. Grumble grumble and bugger me, Marina, but old Boris is benched! No-one is talking about Brilliant BJ. Damned impolite when I resigned on a matter of principle, having not displayed one iota of principle for the entirety of the 54 years I have given humanity the benefit of my existence. Well, I had a call on the telephoney-what-not the other day from Steve Bannon, you know, the man who looks like a suppurating tumour and got Donald Trump elected. He said I can take control of the news by saying mad and bonkers stuff, more mad and bonkers than normal anyway, not British bonkers but Trumpian bonkers. The fake news will faithfully report it all and the racists will love me, and all the racists-but-pretending-they-aren\u0027t will say they\u0027re supporting my economic policies.  So I asked the editor of the Waily Torygraph if they\u0027d like me to write something that would get lots of attention, and they said they could do with something like that, and here it is, Marina old girl! If this doesn\u0027t get me on top of the news agenda for a solid week then nothing will!   Let me read it to you. I spent five whole minutes on it, it\u0027s really good. Listen.  Ahem. If you tell me that we do not have enough state control over what women wear, then I will man the barricades with you, comrades! Let us rip from Muslim women their headscarves, bare the bodies masked by burqas, remark upon the beauty or otherwise of faces covered by niqabs!  It is the sovereign duty of every Englishman, fwar fwar fwar, to see whatever bit of a woman they fancy. Especially if they\u0027ve got dusky skin. Why, I regularly tell my wife to walk around in a balaclava purely so I can exercise my human right, guaranteed at the signing of Magna Carta, to jump out from behind a tree and rip it off again. And that\u0027s why we need to make the Queen walk around naked. Our monarch must set an example that British integration means women being told what to wear, and accepting that most days she looks like a knitted German egg cosy.  I am not in any way being racist. Did I say racist? I didn\u0027t mean to. It\u0027s what people will call me, of course, racist, but don\u0027t let us repeat the word racist in case it causes extra headlines about racism. So many items of female clothing are oppressive, and a truly liberal nation such as ours should not allow women of any race to totter along in high heels, thoughtlessly mimicking the billions of victims of Chinese foot-binding, nor the menace of winter tights that go all bobbly after a single wash and make them look like shabby French mime artists, coming over here and stealing the jobs of Ango-Saxon street artistes.  But let us not stop there, my brethren. Let us also call out the controlling nature of corduroy, the Nazi obsession with nylon, the perverted prevalance of polyester and wrongness of rayon. Nature made totty to titivate us, not to be hidden away! If this makes me a militant feminist then I am happy to confess I am one of the sisterhood.  And don\u0027t get me started on people who cover up their God-given bodies for religious reasons. The priesthood attracts paedophiles precisely because their vestments give them the perfect excuse to hide their true natures. And nuns! They\u0027re basically just angry penguins, aren\u0027t they? Penguins who flatten the wages of British Protestants.   And hair! Women shouldn\u0027t be allowed it, for it covers their skulls! Pluck out their eyelashes, epilate their eyebrows, render them clean of fuzz!  Say so long to saris. Wave bye-bye to baggy sweat pants, winter jumpers, 1920s vintage clothing, duffel coats and pyjamas. No woman needs them, and I say so in a spirit of weird and bullying adoration of the female form because otherwise we\u0027ll be overrun by half-drowned picaninnies.  In a spirit of gender equality I will also point out that not all men in crash helmets are acid-wielding murderers on a rampage, and of course we should not ban them as that would be an example of nanny state control. But if I make you worry about them, you\u0027ll be ripping helmets off little kids on trikes by the end of the week, won\u0027t you? Vote for Boris.  The hard truth everyone in this politically-correct world is too frightened to say is that it\u0027s simply ridiculous for people to choose to go around looking like letter boxes. Dogs urinating on them! Post being shoved into their cakeholes! Being turned to gold with the curse of King Midas if there\u0027s an Olympian nearby! The working classes being oppressed yet again by the elite, of whom I am most definitely one and therefore was born to be PM.    If a woman spoke to me I should feel fully entitled to ask her to divest herself of all clothes first so I could talk to her tits properly. After all, this is how humans have evolved to work. There\u0027s no mention of leather jackets in scripture, you know. Off with that woman\u0027s head.  It applies also to children with cancer, the malingering little brats, in those hospital gowns they just hide sweets in. Little old ladies in tweed, scarecrows in straw hats, roadworkers lurking behind shapeless hi-vis jackets while treacherously talking this country down. This doesn\u0027t mean we should ban clothes or the right of any man or woman to wear what they please when going about their own business. It just means no-one\u0027s been talking about Boris since I resigned, apart from the 1,704 mentions I\u0027ve had since then in British newspapers, and that\u0027s not good enough.  So if I say Muslim women look like bank robbers, act all offended when you say I\u0027ve offended them, and grab lots of headlines while people fail to notice that my \u0027hard truth\u0027 is the same as saying anyone in a mini-skirt is a prostitute , then I\u0027ll get away with encouraging millions of people to attack women in the street just to prove they\u0027re victims of someone else.  Whaddya think, Marina? Churchillian in its sweep, I think future historians will agree, and so illogical as to take up most of the country\u0027s mental bandwidth as they try to understand it and fail to spot that I have become an integral, entertaining and, most worryingly of all, taken-seriously part of their lives. Jolly clever of me, really, ain\u0027t it? They\u0027ll never notice, and the Tory faithful will lap it up. Next week, I will tell them we need to build a wall on our northern border and make the Scots pay for it, that the NHS must be dismantled for the good of our health and the RAF must shoot down any planes with Muslims on board. We\u0027ll call it Boris\u0027 Battle of Britain. Rah!

Labour backbencher Anna McMorrin sets out for the frozen North later this month - 55 years after her father Ian was on the British Antarctic Survey. He died in October aged 79 - but Anna is keeping his memory alive with her fact-finding mission at the top of the world. “My trip pales into insignificance compared to his, but it will be really interesting to get even the tiniest little glimpse of the kind of environment that my father was in nearly 60 years ago,” she said.  “I was always really proud of him for having done it, because it’s not everyone’s dad who has been to the Antarctic. “Growing up, I remember his many stories of life in that vast, beautiful, untouched landscape and how the natural world shaped him. “His passion for the environment and his determination to change things has stayed with me.” Cardiff North MP Anna, 46, and colleagues from the Commons Environmental Audit Committee will investigate how micro-plastic contamination is harming marine life. They will see first-hand the affects of climate change and plastic pollution on the Arctic Circle. Her father’s pioneering work in the early 1960s included looking at the difference in weather patterns and ice. His contribution to research was immortalised in the naming of the McMorrin Glacier.  Ian was one of 12 researchers despatched to the Antarctic in 1961 - and his tales of the mission involving sleds, huskies and whales kept Anna and her sister gripped at bedtime. The proud MP said: “One of the stories he used to tell me and my sister was when he was going out in a little boat to catch fish, which they had to do to survive. “If you fell in the water you literally had seconds to live. “He turned around and suddenly this huge eye had risen next to the boat, and it was a huge whale.  “He just sat there absolutely still because he knew that with one flick of the tail, if they ended up in the water they would be dead. “This whale came over, looked at them and submerged itself and swam way. Life was hard for the duration of the trip. “One boat came to them with supplies during the whole time there were there, so it really was completely cut off, she said. “They had letters sent to them but obviously they got them all at once so they would store them up.” Ian’s passion for exploration and science rubbed off on his daughter, fuelling her own quest years later.

Taking a plastic cup and some tape, she attached it to her prosthetic leg and matter-of-factly began dancing around the room. The 13-year-old lost her leg in a horrific bus crash when she was just two years old – a tragedy that seriously injured her mother Sarah and killed her grandmother Elizabeth - but has always wanted to be able to stand on tip-toes like other dancers. Unfortunately there has been no prosthetic to allow her to do this. But in emotional scenes in a TV doc tonight, viewers will see an inventor help Pollyanna, so that she no longer has to try to make her own.  Her mum Sarah, 46, explains: “Pollyanna attaches a plastic cup to her leg with gaffer tape. Once she made another pointe leg out of a Pringles tube. She just decided that despite what anyone said, she could do it. She was always dancing around the kitchen on her own.” Pollyanna has always refused to let her disability hold her back despite 21 operations and more than 20 prosthetics over the last decade, but the ballet world is unforgiving and she remembers one particularly tough moment. “In my ballet exam I got marks off because I didn\u0027t point my foot,” says Pollyanna. “It\u0027s quite difficult to point your foot when you don\u0027t have a foot.” Sarah, who won a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain award for her campaigning and charity work around prosthetics and child amputees, adds: “Pollyanna was about seven. It was quite hard when the results came out. “Pollyanna has quite good musicality and is naturally quite elegant, but she was marked down for footwork. She scraped a pass and all her other little friends got distinction. We didn\u0027t want her to grow up thinking she couldn\u0027t do anything, so we decided we didn\u0027t want her to do exams. “She gave up ballet for a while and became a national champion in horse riding for the Riding for the Disabled Association. But when she was 10 she wanted to do ballet again.”  Pollyanna, who lives in Harpenden with mum Sarah, dad Christopher, sister Sapphire, 16, and brother Barnaby, 18, was even asked to audition for the Royal Ballet when she was 11. “There was a lot of build up which was all quite positive and exciting, then we got a two-line rejection email,” recalls Sarah. “She didn\u0027t make a song and dance about it, she just moved on. “The Royal Ballet may have said no, but she thought \u0027Well I can actually.\u0027 She filmed herself dancing in our kitchen and put it on YouTube. It got thousands of hits.” After that, dad Christopher, 46, put the video out on social media with the message: “My daughter wants to do ballet, who can help?” The family was bombarded with messages from across the globe offering solutions. That\u0027s when they were contacted by the team from the BBC2 documentary, Inventing The Impossible: Big Life Fix, which sees inventors and engineers come up with solutions for those who face day-to-day difficulties. In the doc, inventor Yusuf Mohammed is tasked with creating a new prosthetic leg for Pollyanna. Viewers will see Pollyanna pirouetting across the room on her blade, before working with Yusuf to come up with something that allows her to move onto her toes. “The leg is brilliant,” says Sarah. “She has beaten off competition from around 200 able-bodied children to win a place on a contemporary dance course in London and will take the leg and see how she gets on. She got the place because of her drive, her potential and her talent.

The footage was filmed by single-mum Jemma Shaw, 29, who lured the thief in to her home after offering to buy the bike less than 24 hours after it was taken. Jemma\u0027s 12-year-old son Alfie Whitby had his beloved BMX stolen from a park close to their home in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire on Sunday. Mum-of-two Jemma scoured Facebook and saw the thief had listed the item for sale on a local selling site so contacted the seller to see if she could have a look at it. The hapless thief can be heard on the video saying \u0027I\u0027ve had it for ages\u0027 after being challenged by Jemma about where he got the bike from.  He is seen trudging into Jemma\u0027s front room with the bike and she challenges him: No you haven\u0027t, you stole this yesterday, you\u0027re on video. The thief, who was sporting a South Park t-shirt, then huffs \u0027errr, ok then\u0027 and then makes a run for it out the front door. Jemma then shouts after him: You have stolen from a 12-year-old boy - you absolute evil b*****d. But it wasn\u0027t all bad news for Jemma and Alfie - who bought the bike for \u0026pound160 new - as the thief had even fixed his broken back brake.  Jemma, who has lived at the address for a year and owns her own cleaning business, said: Over the past year I have become a very spiritual person. I now see the good in everyone. I don\u0027t believe we should be scared of people like this or be worried about things happening in the places where they live.

Tragic Ellie Phillips researched suicide methods online and wrote about her own funeral. The inquest was told that the star hockey player had issues with her school and friendship groups in her year. Her mother Michelle told the coroner that Ellie was a private person who was quite negative. She said her younger daughter was thoughtful, considerate and kept her cards close to her chest. But she said they were quite similar because the teenager was quite argumentative and always wanted the last word.  Michelle said she was \u0027addicted to her iPhone\u0027 and she threatened to confiscate it and her iPad because of her daughter\u0027s attitude. She said during the last summer holidays she spent a lot of time on her own and was blanked by three school friends when she saw them on a shopping trip. The senior Devon coroner Philip Spinney heard that Ellie was not happy at the independent Shebbear College school in Devon and wanted to leave to go to another school. Her stepfather Stuart Ley said: She was a glass half empty person, not naughty but argumentative.  He said she would not confide in him and was guarded because he wasn\u0027t her real dad\u0027 who had moved away to Truro, Cornwall, when her parents\u0027 marriage ended. He said Ellie did not have many friends and was \u0027socially isolated\u0027 after being left out which left her feeling moody. The day before her death she had captained her school hockey team to their best result in a tournament and Ellie was player of the tournament. She also represented Cornwall at hockey.  On the day she died she talked about people who she did not like before going to a pond area to do her homework at their dairy farm at Sutcombe, North Devon. She did not try and conceal herself as she played loud music before she hanged herself. Her mum found her and tried to revive her but she died in North Devon hospital. A post-mortem concluded she died from hanging. The inquest at Exeter\u0027s County Hall heard she had \u0027some social concerns about not fitting in\u0027 but the Year 9 student\u0027s behaviour was normal and her GP said she had no mental health issues. Det Con Emma Baker said she found two notes on Ellie\u0027s iPhone which were dated May and September 2017 where she was \u0027considering the end\u0027.

And Maryanne, 46, and Tommy Pilling, 60, are no different - as they recently proved with their choice of anniversary cards for each other.  The happy couple, who both have Down\u0027s syndrome, celebrated an incredible 23 years of marriage last month with their loved ones.  But when they handed each other the cards they had lovingly chosen, they were met with a heartwarming surprise - because they matched.  Maryanne\u0027s card for her doting partner was a light green-blue colour, with the words: For my amazing HUSBAND on our anniversary.   And the one she received back was almost identical - but in a light pink colour and reading: For my beautiful WIFE on our anniversary.  Remarkably, the cards both had the same design.  The couple\u0027s stunned loved ones shared an image of the cards on a Facebook page which follows Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s romance. They wrote: The anniversary cards that Maryanne and Tom bought for each other..... I never realised they knew each other quite so well!! Maryanne and Tommy, who live together in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, tied the knot in a beautiful church ceremony in July 1995. The beaming bride wore a Cinderella-style gown for the Shoeburyness service, while her groom donned a made-to-measure suit.  Almost a quarter of a century on, they remain happily married, sharing kisses and cuddles and making amazing memories every day. Maryanne tells her husband she loves him three times a day, lights up when she speaks of him and enjoys going out to concerts with him.  But sadly, in recent years, Tommy has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u0027s disease - and continues to display early signs of the condition.  He is getting more forgetful, while it is becoming harder for him to speak and be understood by those who aren\u0027t close to him. Maryanne\u0027s mum Linda Martin explained what she and other loved ones have told her daughter about Tommy\u0027s condition and the future. At the moment, we just say that Tommy is getting older and he forgets things, and he needs a bit more care, she said in a recent podcast.  And that is enough for Maryanne to deal with at the moment. We go on a day -to-day basis. So at this moment, baby steps, she added. Linda spoke out about her daughter and son-in-law on Jo Piazza\u0027s Committed Podcast earlier this year, ahead of their anniversary.  She also revealed her joy at the couple\u0027s beautiful love for each other.  This love has defied both the odds and critics - who have previously called Linda a \u0027bad mother\u0027 for allowing Maryanne to get married. But as far as the mum is concerned, the fact her daughter has found somebody to love is the best thing she could have ever wished for. She said: I wish I could have found a love like it in my life - because it\u0027s very honest, it\u0027s very true and it really is a beautiful thing.  She added: I can always remember saying I don\u0027t care what she [Maryanne] achieves, I just hope to God she finds somebody to love. And she did, she has. And to me, that\u0027s the best thing I could have ever wished for her. Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s fairytale relationship began 28 years ago. The couple, who share a passion for cooking, met through fate in 1990 while working in a local training centre for people with disabilities. At the time, Maryanne was 19 - 13 years younger than Tommy. But from the moment they met, they shared an incredible connection. When asked what she thought of her first encounter with her future husband, Maryanne told podcast host Jo: That I love him. Just true love. It wasn\u0027t long after that Maryanne brought Tommy home to meet her family. She giggled happily as she proudly introduced him.  That\u0027s when I realised my little girl was falling in love, said Linda. Although Tommy was fairly quiet, Maryanne soon brought him out of his shell. And a year after they met, things became very serious. Deciding he wished to propose to his beloved girlfriend, a besotted Tommy bought a plastic ring for her from a vending machine. He then gave it to Maryanne, who was elated. She excitedly showed her mum the ring, saying Tommy wants us to get engaged. Linda, who admitted her first thought was good God, sat down with her daughter and Tommy and asked them what they wanted. In response, the couple said they wished to marry each other.  Linda then took the pair to get a proper ring and for the next four years, they remained engaged, getting to know each other properly. In mid-July 1995, they finally tied the knot in a perfect\u0027 ceremony, surrounded by hundreds of family and friends, and so much love. Linda said her daughter looked stunning in her white dress, tiara and long veil, while Tommy proudly wore his made-to-measure suit. For their honeymoon, the couple stayed in a seafront hotel, according to the podcast, \u0027Love Me Tender\u0027, which was released earlier this summer. Afterwards, Tommy moved into Maryanne’s family home. However, amid the post-wedding bliss, Linda received cruel messages telling her that she shouldn\u0027t have allowed her daughter to get married. But she told Jo: For me as a mother, I would have felt I\u0027d failed her if I hadn\u0027t acknowledged the fact that she was in love with somebody.  Maryanne and Tommy later moved into their own flat. Today, they continue to live independently there, next door to both of their mums and across the road from Maryanne\u0027s sister, Lindi. And despite needing assistance from their loved ones with most aspects of their life, including cooking and washing, they manage superbly. They go out on dates and day trips and, recently, Tommy celebrated his 60th birthday with a huge party. As always, his wife was by his side. Pictures of the happy pair - who were thought to be the first couple with Down\u0027s syndrome to wed in 1995 - are regularly posted online.  The Facebook page about their relationship - set up by Lindi - has amassed more than 40,000 followers, with the numbers rising.   A post on the \u0027Maryanne and Tommy\u0027 page reveals the couple renewed their wedding vows 13 years ago - then again three years ago. It adds: They have now been together for 28 years, since Maryanne was 19 years of age. Tommy is 13 years older than Maryanne and he recently celebrated turning 60! On World Down Syndrome day too! Their marriage is like a fairytale and they are the most blissfully happy couple that I know. I think most of us could learn a thing or two from them! When they got engaged 25 years ago many many people doubted them, said it was disgusting and they shouldn’t be allowed to get married, they also said that it would never work. But I like to say they are still as happy as they were 28 years ago when they first met. This page shows their love for one another quite clearly, it shows how happy they are, how much they adore each other and it proves to all the doubters that anything is possible with love.

Their money comes from a number of different sources, and they\u0027ve both had paid jobs in the past. But a lot of their fortune is from inheritance, with their mum Diana and their great-grandmother leaving them money in their wills. While Diana\u0027s fortune was split evenly between them, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother decided to leave Prince Harry a lot more than his older brother.  But it wasn\u0027t just because she preferred Harry or had some strange problem with William, and there was actually a very thoughtful reason behind it. Years before she died, the Queen Mother reportedly put a large chunk of her money into a trust fund for all her great grandchildren. Harry and William shared about \u0026pound14m of this, with the bulk going to Harry, reports the BBC . When the Queen dies and Prince Charles becomes king, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, will become the new Prince of Wales. This means he will take on the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate which funds the public, charitable and private activities of the heir to the throne. Prince Harry on the other hand, won\u0027t get any of this.  After her death, Buckingham Palace released an outline of the Queen Mother\u0027s will, after going through the high court to try and keep it private. Her estate, which was valued at between \u0026pound50m and \u0026pound70m at the time, was passed onto her daughter the Queen. Her majesty did not have to pay inheritance on the fortune. Many items from the Queen\u0027s private art collection were given to the royal collection and went on display at the Palace. Prince Charles moved into her home Clarence House. A statement released at the time read: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother has bequeathed her entire estate (which mainly comprises the contents of her houses) to The Queen.

Soccer-mad Jade Almond, 16, hit her head on a door frame after leaning back too far on her chair three weeks ago. Within 12 hours the budding goalie was left with uncontrollable shakes and unable to put her pressure on her right leg. The condition has left her right leg \u0027shivering constantly\u0027 with extreme shaking \u0027like she was wearing a bikini in the Antarctic\u0027. Doctors have now said the bump triggered a mystery condition called functional neurological disorder (FND).  The Wigan Athletic Ladies goalie is suffering multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u0027s disease-like symptoms and will need to undertake a strict rehabilitation regime in order to recover. Jade\u0027s anxious mother Michelle Almond, 41, says the teenage goalkeeping starlet had her whole life ahead of her before the bizarre injury. Michelle, of Wigan, Lancs., said: Jade is a trooper and doing really well - she had the whole world ahead of her and now this has happened. Jade was undertaking a four week long National Citizen Service (NCS) course, an annual school holiday scheme set up brimming with activities, which included rafting and climbing in the first week. But it was in the classroom in week two of the four week task at the University of Manchester when she hit her head on the back of a door frame on Saturday, July 14. It left the football mad teen feeling sick and \u0027spaced out\u0027 but she continued with her pals and partook in the afternoon session. However, Jade then hit her head again on the window of their mini bus, due to the motion of the vehicle, while travelling to another part of the campus.  Jade said: I can\u0027t remember much of the day after hitting my head on the door frame. It\u0027s all a blur really to be honest, I was just out of it. All I want to do now is to get better, be able to go to Sixth Form in September and continue doing what I was doing. After becoming ill and not being able to walk at 9pm the same evening, she was sent to Manchester Royal Infirmary by worried course organisers. I got the dreaded call from the organisers of the award who said Jade had bumped her head and was being sent to hospital, said call handler Michelle. The mum-of-three added: Jade being a goalkeeper, we knew it was bad because she is a tough goalkeeper. She\u0027s had broken bones and cuts and bruises - she\u0027s tough. She has never suffered from headaches or have any family members who have neurological diseases. Jade just shakes and to look at her you would think she has Parkinson\u0027s - it\u0027s that bad. It\u0027s like she is wearing a bikini in the Antarctic and is just shivering constantly on her right leg.

Charlotte Jones fell in love with the luxury shoe brand - worn by celebrities including Kate Moss, Beyonce and Melania Trump - when her partner gave her a pair as a gift.  The 30-year-old wore the black heels into the ground and, after booking a holiday to Ibiza three years ago, she realised they were so battered she needed new ones. But she didn\u0027t want to pay \u0026pound800 and feared she would end up with fakes if she bought them online.  It was then that Charlotte got the idea to set up her own shoe salon specialising in unworn and unwanted Loubs at a fraction of the cost. She spent a year learning how to properly authenticate the shoes named after high end French stiletto creator Christian Louboutin, who has been designing women\u0027s heels since 1991. Charlotte now runs her own brand Love Luxe from her home in Barnsley, South Yorks.  Her earnings now trump her partner Dael Baxter, 33, an internet marketer who helped her set up the business officially last year. It means she can stay home with stepson Jack, 11, and daughters Anyssa, seven, and Briseis, three months. Charlotte said she has sold upwards of 400 pairs of Louboutins and celebrity fans include glamour model Chloe Khan and reality star Jodie Marsh. She also sells other high end designer gear like Chanel and Alexander McQueen.  But her real passion is still Louboutins. She now has a network of private sellers, many with collections in the hundreds. Most of the shoes she sells are boxed and unworn, with their owners being given so many pairs by partners and husbands that they simply can\u0027t wear them all. Charlotte said: It\u0027s hard to believe, but there are ladies out there with hundreds of pairs and many of them aren\u0027t even fussed. It started by chance really. About three years ago, I only had one pair of Louboutins and I\u0027d worn them to death.  Me and my partner had a nice holiday planned, we were going to Ibiza and planned to try out some really nice restaurants and I wanted to look good. Obviously I needed some new shoes but I didn\u0027t want to buy two or three pairs of Louboutins at full price because they\u0027re so expensive. I was looking around and realised that there wasn\u0027t really anything in between. You can either buy them full price or you can chance it [online] ... but you never really know whether they\u0027re authentic.  I contacted some private sellers and managed to get two or three pairs at less than half the price. I just thought \u0027There\u0027s a market for this\u0027. It started as a hobby and then just snowballed. Part of the job is driving hundreds of miles to pick up pairs from across the country and her car is often crammed full of Louboutin cardboard boxes. As well as selling the brand, she also has her own collection of 11 pairs - including her first ever \u0026pound495 Irizas - but says her tastes are always evolving. Her aim was to allow women just like her the opportunity to be able to afford a pair of designer shoes without having to fork out for the huge price tag, which for many was unaffordable.  She even offers prospective purchasers credit if they need it as well as a 14-day return window. Charlotte said: A lot of the shoes are brand new, the ladies have been bought them as gifts and they don\u0027t fit or they don\u0027t like them. You\u0027d be amazed, some women have huge collections and they never wear them. Every lady should be able to buy a pair of high end shoes. She added: I don\u0027t make too much of a profit. I try and keep the price as low as possible.

Anxious Amanda Muller says toddlers Luca and Romy were stalked by the insects while visiting a beauty spot in Louth, Lincolnshire.  She says little Romy\u0027s lip ballooned and Luca had a spike in his temperature after they were stung in the face, Grimsby Live reports.  She has now called for more warning signs at the scenic beauty spot where she claims families are being terrorised by large swarms. The incident occurred at Hubbard’s Hills, Louth.   Drunk US woman tells cops they shouldn\u0027t arrest her because she\u0027s \u0027pretty, thoroughbred and white\u0027  Mum-of-four Amanda, who co-owns a dance academy, said: “We were there a couple of weeks ago and it was ace. So we thought we would all go again and took pack ups. But within half an hour I was in A\u0026ampE with the twins. Luca and his sister Romy, who are due to celebrate their second birthdays on Sunday, were eating snacks. Wasps stung Luca on the top lip first as he munched Mini Cheddars. One then stung Romy on her bottom lip as she ate a ham sandwich. “The kids were not bothered by the wasps buzzing around them but we were wafting them away, said Amanda.  But it was like being stalked. They did not go away, even though you spun around. We moved to another spot but they still came for us. “There were other people stung while we were there. The mum is warning other families to be aware of the risk of wasp stings. “There should be more signs up to warn people and what to do if you get stung,” said Amanda, of Holton-le-Clay. A Hubbard’s Hills spokesman said signs warn visitors to be aware of wasps. Both Luca and Romy were treated at Louth County Hospital with anti-histamine and steroids. Most insect bites and stings are not serious and will get better within a few hours or days. Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they\u0027re unlikely to help. But the invasion, due to perfect breeding conditions, has brought plenty of business to pest controllers in northern Lincolnshire. Vermfree owner, Luke Pomfret said he was responding to 50 calls a day and was taking out 10 wasps nests per day due to the impact they are having on households and businesses. Luke - who ironically is allergic to wasp stings - even responded to one wedding venue where guests were fearful to go out due to the swarms of wasps outside. Luke said: “It is unreal. I have never seen anything like it. People who have worked in the profession for over 20 years say they have never seen so many nests.” He added: “It was really poor last summer and I had about 20 nests. But now I am doing up to 10 a day.”  He responded to the Waltham home of Mike Chase who had two nests on his property. He told how he keeps watching out for apples falling from his tree in the back garden because wasps swarm over them within minutes. Try kicking one of those apples, and you would be in trouble, he said. Luke wears a protective suit because of his allergy. He was treated in hospital two years ago after being stung on his ankle. The 29-year-old told how he rapidly became very itchy all over his body and scalp and suffered hives throughout his body. He was treated in hospital. There are lots of things you can do to prevent an invasion and its often easier than dealing with a problem to get rid of them. You should regularly inspect your home for any nests developing. Look in your loft, shed, garage or under the eaves. Also check your garden. Nests will start golfball size. When the queen starts laying eggs, they will grow in size rapidly. You should keep bins away from windows and doors. It\u0027s best to empty and wash them regularly so wasps are not attracted to them. Check your home for any gaps or holes, particularly in the loft. You can put insect mesh over grille vents or air bricks to make it harder for them to get in. Keep sweet-smelling plants, which may attract wasps, away from your doors and windows. Why are there so many wasps? Wasps start appearing in the spring but mainly just the queens who are looking for a suitable nest site. But they start to run out of food around August and that’s when they go out looking for alternatives - normally all the sweet things we have on our tables and in our kitchens."},{"url":null,"title":"wayne rooney leads tributes cameron","story":"NewsWayne Rooney leads tributes to Cameron Rowley, 11, who died after battling cancer at same time as his mumChester FC supporter Cameron passed away at home in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, and the former England captain took to Twitter to share his sorrowShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy ColesSallie Ehlen22:46, 8 AUG 2018Updated22:49, 8 AUG 2018NewsCameron Rowley, 11, pictured during his treatment last year (Image: Liverpool Echo)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Wayne Rooney has paid tribute to an 11-year-old boy who died after fighting cancer at the same time as his mum.   Life-long Chester FC supporter Cameron Rowley passed away at home on Monday surrounded by his family after a three-year battle with a rare form of the disease .   In February Cameron, his dad Brandan and his partner Sam were invited to Everton FC to watch a game against Crystal Palace where Cameron met some of the players including one of his heroes Wayne Rooney, the Chester Chronicle reports.  And he clearly made quite an impression on the legendary player who took to Twitter on Wednesday evening to remember the lad from Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. Sharing a heart-warming picture of them he Wayne wrote: Gutted to hear that young Cameron Rowley sadly passed away this week. It was a pleasure to meet him at Goodison last season. Thoughts and condolences are with his family and friends.  Cameron was diagnosed with desmoplastic small-round-cell tumour (DSRCT) – a very rare and aggressive form of cancer - in April 2015 after being taken ill during a family holiday to Mexico. Doctors initially gave Cameron just two weeks to live - but he fought back, and with treatment beat his prognosis. His mum Jacqueline Hickman, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor when Cameron was five, had to break the devastating news to her oldest son he was terminal in October 2017. Since then Cameron’s parents and three brothers Ben, Jack and Ethan have spent time making memories and enjoying what time they had left with the football-mad youngster. In a tragic turn of events, Jacqueline was told that she had another tumor in the back of her brain in 2016.  On Monday Cameron\u0027s dad announced the sad news on Facebook : “It is with an incredibly heavy heart that I tell you this afternoon my hero Cameron grew his angel wings and flew to heaven. He was surrounded by his loving family.     “He found peace with all the support from his family and many friends and has now moved on to a pain-free place. “He was such a loving and giving person and everything that made him the best person we know will be sorely missed by all who were privileged to know him. “I could never be more proud of you son for never giving up, you have battled hard for over three years, you were the best role model for your brothers. You spread happiness and joy in everything you did and I am so thankful and privileged to be your dad Cameron Rowley. Since Cameron’s death was announced tributes have been flooding in from friends and family and the football community. The Chester FC club Twitter account put out a tribute following the team\u0027s 3-0 win at Curzon Ashton on Monday night. It said: Our deepest condolences are with the family and friends of Cameron Rowley – who has sadly passed away. He was an inspiration to many and will be missed. That win tonight was for you, mate. Chester FC’s Matty Hughes said: “Words can’t describe what all the family is going through right now I’m so sorry. I met Cameron back in 2015 at our training session and stayed in touch ever since. What an absolute hero and inspiration he was not only to me but to everyone who ever met this little boy. You’ve fought till the very end and I’m so proud of you! Goodnight god bless my little buddy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman shocked tinder match makes","story":"NewsWoman shocked when Tinder match makes extremely cheeky request - and then things take a very strange turnAdele Elizabeth couldn\u0027t believe the message the man had sent, so decided to have a bit of fun with himShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor19:51, 8 AUG 2018Updated22:34, 8 AUG 2018NewsAdele Elizabeth (Image: Supplied)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLike most singletons on Tinder, Adele Elizabeth was excited when she saw a message pop up from a new match. But when she read what the man had to say, she was completely shocked. Instead of opening with a cheesy chat up line, an interesting fact about himself or even a safe hello, he decided to tell Adele how hot he thinks her mate is - and even asked if she could give him her number. Wow. But luckily Adele, 23, saw the funny side of it and passed on her pal India\u0027s details - but then things took a very strange, but very funny, turn when she decided to have a bit of fun with the bizarre situation.  Speaking to the Mirror, she said: I laughed when I first saw the message. I wasn\u0027t surprised because India always get the attention on nights out too. Typical man thing to do.  She met 21-year-old India, who is an identical twin, when the pair were working in Corfu and they remained friends after returning home to Nottingham. But Adele, who works for an online fitness company, decided to have a bit of fun with the guy, and said she just couldn\u0027t remember which of the sisters posed for the picture with her - what a pickle! So she told the man the situation and gave him both of their Instagram accounts. How helpful! She said: I passed on their details because I didn\u0027t want to get in the way of him and true love.  And because I thought it was funny for him to work out which twin he should message. The determined guy messaged one of the twins and explained the situation - but awkwardly got the wrong sister. Oh dear... She quickly told him his mistake, and quickly pushed the blame back onto Adele.  But unfortunately, neither of the girls were interested in him. Adele said: Neither of them is looking to date somebody right now and especially not somebody who would message that to their friend. Ouch. Sorry mate...

And when the tumours were discovered, she was given the dreadful news she had stage three cancer. Sarah said: “I had prepared myself for bad news.

Guests staying at luxury resorts and hotels in the Riviera Maya resort area and Cancun in Mexico are reportedly suffering severe sickness and diarrhoea. Last year over 78 Brits were struck down with the bug Cyclospora parasitic bug while the year before 443 Brits were hit by the bug - spread by water and food contaminated by faeces - in the same Riviera Maya and Cancun resort area. The same bug ravaged the area in 2015 with 79 UK tourists being affected. The latest sickness outbreak has affected guests who have mainly stayed in all inclusive hotel resorts and health authorities expect the number of victims to rise like in previous outbreaks. The illness is likely linked to tainted food supplied to hotels throughout the resort areas and victims of the latest outbreak include a Doctor.  Guests are believed to have eaten contaminated food in their hotels and later fell ill with severe stomach cramps and diarrhoea. Last night Nick Harris Head of Travel at Simpson Millar solicitors - who is representing over 350 victims of past and current outbreaks - said: The current number of victims is just the tip of the iceberg and this is now obviously out of control again but should have been avoided. People should have been warned before travelling so that they could make an informed choice. This is beyond belief. I warned ABTA that British holidaymakers were falling ill with the bug in May when people started contacting me. But they ignored me. They should be warning people travelling to Mexico but seem to put profit before safety. Tour operators are playing Russian roulette with their customers lives. We are being contacted by many affected holidaymakers and I am genuinely concerned that someone will die before the problem is treated seriously.  I would urge anyone who has been sick like this on holiday to contact their GP and ask for a Cyclospora test. Victims who have returned to the UK from the resort have been very sick and after laboratory tests they have since been diagnosed with Cyclospora – a bug commonly associated with food poisoning and poor hygiene. The sickness bug is spread by infected human faeces contaminating water or food and previous outbreaks have been connected to fresh fruit such as raspberries and salad products such as basil and lettuce. Public Health England advice recommends UK tourists to maintain a high standard of food, water and personal hygiene, even if staying in high-end resorts in Mexico. Symptoms include frequent, watery diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, bloating, nausea, flatulence, low-grade fever, loss of appetite and weight and anyone who feels ill should visit their GP immediately after returning home.  Health Protection Scotland have confirmed the outbreak on their website. They said in warning statement posted on their site: “Cases of infection with the diarrhoea causing parasite Cyclospora have continued to be reported by UK holidaymakers returning from Mexico. This is the fourth successive year since 2015 that cases of cyclospora infection have been reported in travellers returning from Mexico. 46 cases of cyclospora have been reported in England, Scotland and Wales. Where information is known, cases have stayed at several different hotels in the Cancun and Riviera Maya region (mostly on an all-inclusive basis), suggesting the source is again likely to be a foodstuff that has been distributed to hotels throughout the region. Richard Elson, Head of Risk Assessment and Response of National Infection Service at Public Health England, said: We strongly urge people to maintain a high standard of food, water and personal hygiene when travelling to the Riviera Maya coast in Mexico and to be aware of the risk of Infection from a food and water bug, Cyclospora.

The president wishes his partner a speedy recovery in the post.  Another Facebook picture released by the couple shows a healthy-looking Asma upright with a heavily bandaged wrist. The post read in Arabic: I belong to the (Syrian) people who taught the world steadfastness, strength and how to face difficulties My determination comes from your determination and strength in the past years. The Syrian First Lady is being treated at a military hospital in Damascus, according to state news agency SANA, but gave no further details about her condition. 42-year-old Asma Assad, born in London to Syrian parents, married her husband in 2000 and moved to Syria\u0027s capital Damascus just six months after the pair were wed. Her father, who lives in west London, moved to the UK to train as a cardiologist at Cromwell Hospital and has been described as a key liasion between the Syrian and British governments.  The pair have three children - sons Hafez, born in 2001, and Karim, born in 2004, and daughter Zein, born in 2003. The former City investment banker was seen as a reforming figure in the Assad regime and enjoyed a positive public image prior to the outbreak of Syria\u0027s bloody civil war in 2011. Asma has been praised for her charity work and championed economic development and women\u0027s rights in the largely conservative Muslim nation. Since then, however, attitudes towards her have soured as atrocities by Syrian authorities became widely known. In 2012, her assets were frozen by the European Union who placed a travel ban on her and her husband   Her Instagram account shows her frequent meetings with Syrian government troops as well as families of those injured in the eight-year conflict.  Critics have accused the First Lady of humanising Syria\u0027s repressive dictatorship which has killed thousands of civilians in chemical weapon attacks.

They are reported to have been terminally ill and in so much pain they asked doctors to to end their suffering. They were given the lethal injections in Belgium, where euthanasia is legal regardless of a person\u0027s age. The identities of the children have not been revealed. Their deaths came to light after a new report was published by the CFCEE the commission that regulates euthanasia in Belgium. It was confirmed by an official that the nine-year-old had a brain tumour, and the 11-year-old was suffering from cystic fibrosis, according to the Washington Post .  The children would have had to follow a procedure where they make their wish known in writing. They would then be examined by child psychiatrists to ensure they are intelligent enough to make the decision and are not influenced by a third party. However, parents can overrule their child\u0027s wishes. The pair were given the fatal injection between 2016 and 2017, along with a 17-year-old who had muscular dystrophy. Of the 4,337 who asked for assisted dying in Belgium in 2016 and 2017, most were cancer patients. Belgium amended its euthanasia law in 2014 to make it legal for doctors to end the life of a child, however young, following their request. Luc Proot, a member of the CFCEE, defended the decision to authorise the young euthanasia cases, saying: “I saw mental and physical suffering so overwhelming that I thought we did a good thing.”  For euthanasia to proceed in Belgium, doctors must first verify that a child is “in a hopeless medical situation of constant and unbearable suffering that cannot be eased and which will cause death in the short term.” In the UK, assisted dying is illegal - but a Mirror poll in June found that three out of four Brits would support a law change to allow it. They want people with a terminal illness who have six months or less to live to be given the right to decide when they die. However, critics have said relaxing assisted dying laws would put pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives. These people might end up doing so out of fear of being a financial, emotional and care burden, the critics claim.

I think he is perfect for Scottish football.“When I signed him before he was very good for me and he got his move to Aalborg on the back of that.“He has trained with us now but he is still a player at Aalborg so it is in the hands of the two clubs.”Safranko made 28 appearances for AaB last season but has dropped to the bench for the early games of this term after a formation change.That’s prompted him to seek a regular starting place elsewhere in a bid to add to his two Slovakia caps and he sees teaming up with his old boss again as the perfect way to achieve that.Although United have not ruled out a move for Austrian attacker Toni Vastic after his trial last week, with Safranko not coming cheap, that now looks unlikely.Csaba, meanwhile, has apologised to fans for his team’s poor showing in Saturday’s defeat against Dunfermline.He’s made it clear the display that led to three second half goals being conceded at Tannadice was unacceptable.“I have to apologise to the fans, for all the people who like and love Dundee United, for the performance and the result on Saturday.“The second half was nowhere near good enough, it wasn’t acceptable,” he added.“It was not what the fans, the staff and even the players wanted.“The players told me, gaffer we have to go and really tell everybody sorry but I take the responsibility.“Of course, we know every team can lose games but we know we should not lose like we did in the match.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united have to start getting it right from now on says edjenguele","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith so many changes to the squad taking place over the summer, experienced defender William Edjenguele knows it was always going to take new-look Dundee United time to gel.However, the experience the 31-year-old has amassed over his career and, in particular, of life in the Championship over the past two seasons with the Tangerines, tells him they better find a way to do it quickly.Like every other United player, the big Frenchman was gutted by Saturday’s 3-2 home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline in their league opener.It goes without saying that loss was not what the incumbents of the Tannadice dressing-room wanted or expected.“It was the first game of the season and at home, so you want to start well and that’s what we didn’t do,” he said.“In the first half we didn’t play particularly well but we managed to get the first goal and it looked the kind of game where the team who got it would be the winner.“And I thought in the first half, while we were not playing that well, neither team was. However, we were showing togetherness and real fight.“Second half there were a few mistakes and that cost us the game.“We were a bit unlucky as well because there was a handball in the move for their second goal and it should have been a foul for us.“You can’t use that as an excuse because he (the referee) did not give it and you have to defend the situation.”Neither will Edjenguele use the vast changes to the squad over the summer to deflect from what fans had a right to expect to be a much better start.The weekend saw nine men in tangerine making their league debuts for the club.That meant only two of the team that beat the Pars over two legs in the promotion play-off quarter-final just last May, were involved in the United starting line-up.Having been at eight clubs in his 13-year senior career, he knows better than most that any new group needs time to get to know each other and that’s definitely the case at Tannadice where he’s never seen so many comings and goings in such a short period.He’s well aware, however, that, while that process could take two or three months, it cannot be at the expense of results.“Definitely it will take time. I don’t even know how many players exactly came in but it was a lot.“There were a lot of changes, so we definitely need some time to gel together.“And I should say I do respect Dunfermline. They are a good side, especially going forward, and they have some decent players. So if you don’t play well they can beat you.“At home you expect us to do a bit better than that. Everybody is disappointed but we have to go again.“It was a hard day but we have to make sure we are better right away because the one thing that you find out is the season goes by fast and we have to be ready to go quickly.“We have to play better, starting with the next game. It’s as simple as that.”After the struggles of the Betfred Cup group that saw United come out on top in just one of their four ties and even then only after they already knew they were out of the competition, it’s fair to say many supporters feared the worst going into the Dunfermline clash.Edjenguele, though, insists the players had been in confident mood.The feeling was they were coming together as a team and would be ready for the opening 90 minutes of league action. That, of course, only made defeat more painful.“Some of the results in the cup were not good until the Elgin game,” he said.“We were making progress and things were moving in the right direction, so this was a real setback.“Like I say, now we must work to make sure we are ready this week.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united kids earn scotland call up to face england and turkey","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThree of Dundee United’s academy youngsters have been chosen to represent Scotland in the upcoming U/16 matches against England and Turkey.Midfielders Christopher Mochrie and Lewis Neilson and defender Adam Hutchison are included by Scotland coach Billy Stark.The game against the English will take place on August 20 at 3pm and the meeting with the Turks kicks off two days later.Both are to be played at the English FA’s St George’s Park complex.United’s senior academy manager Brian Grant said: “It is great to see these three lads rewarded for their hard work and application.

Thanks.”The firm was reportedly liquidated last Friday.Teejay – which takes its name from the initials of its director, Thomas Jordan – had operated routes in Angus including the 43/43A loop around Arbroath.It was also in charge of the 78A and 79A services that linked Dundee with Monikie, Monifieth, Ethiebeaton and Kellas.Teejay’s latest accounts revealed assets totalling just over £56,000 as of the end of 2017.Stagecoach East Scotland has arranged with Angus Council to take over Teejay’s routes until a permanent operator can be found.A spokeswoman for the council said: “We can confirm that we have arranged for Stagecoach to operate the local bus contracts in the short term.”Douglas Robertson, commercial director at Stagecoach East Scotland, said: “As a result of the recent administration of local bus operator Teejay Travel, we were asked by Angus Council to step in to cover the contracts previously operated by Teejay.“We are delighted to be able to provide the resource in order to operate these contracts on behalf of the local authority, ensuring customers see no disruption to their travel.”Teejay Travel could not be reached for further comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b69627bdece2-448x564.jpg ","title":"tom duthie patience and time in short supply for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the dust settles on a disappointing opening-day result against Dunfermline at Tannadice, a few moments’ calm reflection could lead to the conclusion all this Dundee United squad needs to be Championship contenders is a little time and patience.Give Csaba Laszlo’s rebuilt squad a few more weeks to gel and they could be a strong force at this level.And a little patience during those weeks to forgive mistakes that are probably inevitable would help with that process.So much for the theory, now for the harsh reality. It can be summed up with the following words – tough luck, because both are going to be in short supply.When it comes to the first, the fact is the time to be ready for any league season is on day one.At the weekend, United were not and that’s why, despite losing out to the odd goal in five, they were comprehensively beaten by a Pars outfit that was ready for action while they were found lacking.In pointing that out, it’s worth remembering that, although Dunfermline’s wasn’t quite to the same extent, over the summer circumstances meant they were forced to undertake a major overhaul of their squad that saw players leave and 10 new faces brought in.That was not least because they lost two of their key performers, Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird, to the Tangerines. Despite that, particularly during the second half of the weekend game, the visitors looked a strong and cohesive unit that was sound at the back and dangerous going forward.By way of contrast, the longer the game went on the more disjointed United became.However valid the reasons for that may be, the rest of the Championship is not going to sit back and give them time to get their act together.In Dumfries this weekend it’s more than reasonable to expect Queen of the South to do all they can to come out of the blocks quickly, hit United hard and early and try to stay on top of them.That’s just common sense and an approach that’s to be expected from the opposition for weeks to come, if not longer.Put simply, when a team looks as vulnerable as Csaba Laszlo’s do, they are going to be tested early in games and it’s only by winning matches they can expect opponents to start cautiously.As for patience, something being sought from fans, there has to be a realisation that among Arabs it’s not so much worn thin as disintegrated.A support that’s been used to top-six finishes in the Premiership and cup final appearances, has been put through hell and are now facing a third season out of the top flight.So much so that when new chairman Mike Martin addresses them, he often starts off with an apology, and wisely so.Through no fault of their own, supporters have been stuck in a long dark tunnel and, if they cannot see any light at the end of it, they cannot be asked to show understanding.Make no mistake about it, their team is where it is because results dictate that’s their true position in Scottish football.But when they look at where Dundee United have been and the lingering perception of it as a size of club, the very least Arabs have a right to expect is a side that’s challenging to get back up.Some 5,000 of them turned up for the league opener and gave yet another indication of where United could be.No other clubs outside of the Old Firm, Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs can rely on that kind of turn-out on a Saturday.If this team don’t start producing, they’ll not be able to either.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

Sir Alex Ferguson took chances with the Class of ’92 at Manchester United and he took chances playing young kids at Aberdeen.“He gave Eric Black, John Hewitt and others their chance and they came through.“It would be good to see another striker like Bruce come through because if you’re good enough, you’re old enough, in my opinion.”Dons gaffer McInnes is still hoping to sign another striker before the transfer window closes at the end of the month – and ideally he would like another frontman in before Saturday’s game with Dundee.With Adam Rooney leaving the Granite City for Salford City earlier in the summer, Aberdeen have two senior strikers in Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove.May, a £400,000 signing from Preston North End a year ago, struggled in his first campaign – particularly after an injury sustained in December against Rangers after a bad tackle from Ryan Jack, while Cosgrove – who joined in January from Carlisle – is only 20 and has yet to score in a competitive game for the Dons.McDougall joined Aberdeen in 1984 from St Mirren and helped the Reds win the Premier Division title in 1985 and the League Cup and Scottish Cup the following season.After his goal-laden time at Pittodrie, he was forced to retire in 1987, aged 29, due to injury.McDougall believes McInnes is right to try to add another striker and believes the goals of Rooney need to be replaced.He also reckons it’s important Aberdeen bide their time and wait for the right attacker to become available.McDougall added: “I think they need another striker added to their squad. Derek McInnes knows that and is working on it they lost Adam Rooney to Salford and his goals need replaced.“They need more firepower up front than what they have at the moment.“I just don’t see enough goals in the senior strikers. I’d love to see it but I feel they need a little bit more.“There have been encouraging signs for the season – they did well against Burnley in the Europa League and Lewis Ferguson looks a good player – but I would like to see another striker signed.“You can get strikers but Aberdeen don’t want to take in anybody, they need somebody with a bit of class because they want to keep moving forward.“Derek’s resources are limited so he’s right to wait for the right striker because he wants to make the right decision.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"charity cyclists return","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of north-east cyclists has returned home after completing a five-day 700-mile cycle for charity.Organised by Stonehaven community group Strive, the cyclists set out on Wednesday and covered the length of Scotland, from Stonehaven to Melrose, and back in aid of rugby legend Doddie Weir’s Motor Neurone Disease charity – the My Name’5 Doddie Foundation.During the challenge, the cyclists met Scottish Rugby Union chairman Colin Grassie, the Glasgow Warriors squad at Scotstoun Stadium and Doddie.Strive is aiming to hit a fundraising target of £75,000 this year, with a rugby tournament and charity ball on at Aberdeen’s Marcliffe Hotel still to come.Strive founder Willie Tulloch said: “The whole experience has been absolutely fantastic and we were completely overwhelmed by the support that was given to us as we travelled.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your chance to speak up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTime is running out for people to have their say on a survey about Aberdeen\u0026#8217s transport.Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans and Robert Gordon University (RGU) are working on a project which aims to improve transport choices in Aberdeen.The survey is looking for people over the age of 16 and who have a journey of up to 10km to work or study.The EU-funded project, entitled the Civitas Portis European Project, looks at cities with ports close to their city centre and looks at the challenges of having a busy working harbour.The group is keen to find out how many journeys take place within Aberdeen city which are walkable or cycleable and which modes of transport people are picking and why.The consultation, which opened on May 14, will close on August 13 and can be completed online at bit.ly/2LwlOUL\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"golden bear caps callums golden year in the states","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCallum Bruce will never forget the day he received an honour for his achievements from Jack Nicklaus.Duff House Royal member Callum, 19, who is back in Scotland after finishing his first year at Midland College in Texas, won the Jack Nicklaus Player of the Year award for college golf after an outstanding year.Former Scotland boys international Callum, who finished top qualifier at the Scottish Amateur at Blairgowrie last week, said: “Having made the final six for the Jack Nicklaus award, I was honoured when I received a call to be told I had won it and that I would receive it from Jack himself at an award ceremony.“I was delighted to discover I had to travel to the Memorial PGA tournament at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, for the presentation.“Winning the award and meeting Jack Nicklaus has been the highlight of my golf career to date.

While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 9:27 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,As usual with Councillor Redman, he was so desperate to berate the SNP in his letter published in the July 20 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser that he is unable to see the hypocrisy of his own stance.He talks of \u0026#8216stealth taxes\u0026#8217 hitting \u0026#8216the most vulnerable people in our society, particularly elderly people living alone\u0026#8217.His accusation of \u0026#8216taking their eye off the day job\u0026#8217 begs the question as to where he was when the Tory government introduced its bedroom tax \u0026#8211 a tax on those who needed an extra room for live-in carers, a tax on grandparents who wanted to have their grandchildren to stay for weekends and at holiday times a tax on widows with sons and daughters in the armed forces expected to sleep on a sofa when home on leave.A disgraceful tax which the SNP government abolishedDavid Hay, MinardSir,It was superb to once again meet up with locals in Whitehouse and across west Kintyre. As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jolomo preaches in presence of royalty","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/08/18, 11:49 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowRenowned artist John Lowrie Morrison had a special royal task to perform last weekend.The Tayvallich-based artist, commonly known as Jolomo, is a trained lay reader in the Church of Scotland, and he was invited to preach in Crathie Kirk near Balmoral, in the presence of the Queen and other members of the royal family.Speaking ahead of the service he said: \u0026#8216I am extremely honoured to accept this invitation.

We are confident our proposals have reached an optimum balance between these aspects.\u0026#8216As a responsible developer, we believe it is important to seek public opinion on our proposals and take that feedback into consideration when developing our projects.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crunch meeting on ardrishaig club future","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA meeting is to be held next month to gauge interest in reviving a Mid Argyll sailing club.Disquiet has been growing in Ardrishaig while weeds grow up around sailing boats and canoes belonging to Mid Argyll Water Sports Club.The boats, bought with the help of grant funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust, are lying on the Ardrishaig waterfront, unused in 2018.The Argyllshire Advertiser spoke to Peter Hogbin, who was involved in the club for many years.

The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team.

And the bid to future-proof Craig Tara at the Heads of Ayr is being seen as a huge measure of confidence in the park. A zip-line flying high above a completely refurbished building is the highlight of the new proposals. Bosses at owners Bourne Leisure believe the move is essential to keep families interested in coming to the park. The development follows thousands of pounds being spent already this year on a new pool reception and Millie’s Cookies outlet.  It followed a \u0026pound2.2million Airspace sports development including golf simulator  and climbing wall three years ago.  The 85-acre site traded under the Butlins name until 20 years ago. Now it has also lured in food franchises such as Burger King and Papa Johns. Hastings-based A\u0026ampM Architectural Partnership have just had plans lodged with South Ayrshire Council. They said: “The proposed development will provide a much improved sports and leisure facility for the holiday park guests within a central location. “The proposed works represent a major investment in the park and also confirm Bourne Leisure Limited’s aspirations to provide improved guest facilities and to generally enhance the holiday park by creating a desirable holiday environment, which therefore attracts more guests and in turn contributes a positive economic benefit to the wider area.”  The plans centre on  the sprawling Turnberry Gardens building in the heart of the park.  It could include more sports facilities such as an archery centre. The plan shows a tots zone, a performance area with stage, an RNLI playground and a mini-golf site South Ayrshire Council will determine the application later this year.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsRNLISouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"holidaymakers coaches cannot parked ayr","story":"NewsHolidaymakers coaches cannot get parked in AyrBroken parking barrier causes furyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston12:31, 8 AUG 2018NewsCoach drivers cannot get past this barrier (Image: Elaine Clark)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne hundred and fifty children and parents were dropped off by holiday coaches ... but the drivers couldn’t get parked anywhere legally. They had been directed to a council bus park in Ayr by a policeman, only to have access blocked. Entry to the coach park is via an intercom and barrier – but nobody was answering. Now veteran driver Ian Jackson warned: “The town must get its act together or visitors will go elsewhere.” He led a convoy of three coaches nearly 60 miles from Whitburn in West Lothian. The 53-seater coaches dropped off their passengers outside Pirate Pete’s on the Esplanade last Monday. And Ian,73, of Wishaw, said: “A policeman told us to turn right towards the harbour as there was a coach park there. “We all turned off the esplanade and arrived at the coach park where there was a barrier with an intercom. “I spent 20 minutes pressing it with no answer. “It mean’t all three buses had to reverse out of the street and we had to drive out of the town. We all don’t understand how the council can be so stupid. “The turn-in for buses more than 13 metres long is narrow because of a foot-and-a-half traffic island anyway, so it was chaos reversing out. “Next time the visits might have to be to Largs or somewhere else that can properly cater for us. “These trips can be worth a lot of money for the towns we visit and it is usually a great day out.” There are 20 coach bays behind the car park in Cromwell Road and it has a barrier entrance. Ian also claims he hung on the phone for 25 minutes trying to reach South Ayrshire Council. Ian added: “I was ninth in the queue and I kept on holding I was so incensed. “When I got through they simply said they were not the roads department and I had to call another number. “What a mess.” South Ayrshire Council confessed officials knew there was a problem ... and alleged there were “alternative arrangements”. A spokesman said: “There is an issue with the entrance barrier at the coach park on Cromwell Road and work will be carried out to fix the problem. In the meantime, there are alternative arrangements in place for buses to access the coach park and we’re sorry if these did not work on this occasion.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilWishawWest LothianWhitburnLargs"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"locals ayr discuss what theyd","story":"NewsLocals of Ayr discuss what they\u0027d put in a time capsuleLast week we featured a time capsule that was set to be buried at Burns Monument in Alloway.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet15:51, 7 AUG 2018NewsTime capsule to be buried (Image: Ken McKissock)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCherishing memories is just part of life, everyone does it.

And John Scott MSP believes the 22 homes will breathe new life into an area, off McCall’s Avenue. Mr Scott visited the Britannia Place site, being developed by Hanover Scotland Housing Association, with funding from South Ayrshire Council and the Scottish Government. Builders are CCG (Scotland) Ltd, and the new development, once completed, will be known as Cuthbert Gardens. The name reflects the history of the site, which used to contain the Newton Shoe Factory owned by the Cuthbert family. People are expected to move into the general needs social housing, ranging from two to four bedrooms, early in 2019. Mr Scott met with senior managers from both Hanover Scotland and CCG and was given a tour of the site. He heard about valuable engagement with local residents during construction and how the design had come about, as well as health and safety precautions.  Janice McDonald is the Enhanced Housing Manger for Hanover Scotland. She said: “We already have nine developments in South Ayrshire, and Cuthbert Gardens is our tenth.” She added: “This area is important to future plans and we look forward to delivering more high quality social housing.” John Scott MSP added: “I am delighted to have been able to visit, and look forward to returning to Cuthbert Gardens when it is completed in the New Year. “My office receives regular calls from constituents looking for, in particular, ground level accommodation which is affordable. “So it is hugely welcome that Hanover Scotland and CCG are able to deliver this kind of new supply to the area.” Calum Murray, Director of CCG, said: “This now takes our overall number of homes presently under construction to 61 units. “By utilising ‘offsite’ methods of construction, these new homes will be constructed to the highest quality standard and thanks to a bespoke manufacturing process, their environmental performance will ensure long-term energy savings for the future residents. “CCG can also confirm that as a direct result of this project, we have been able to engage with local colleges to provide training and employment opportunities for the South Ayrshire community.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998. Former pupils from Marr College took to the dance floor at the Marine Hotel last Saturday night to celebrate their 20-year reunion – those who would have started at the Troon school in 1992. There was lots of great banter, reminiscent 90s music and some interesting moves on the dancefloor. People had been sending old photos of themselves from back in the day which was collated into a slideshow. This ran throughout the night, showing that some people had hardly changed at all! Former pupils travelled from all over Scotland to meet old friends, some even came from England, America and as far a Hong Kong to join in the fun. It was a great night enjoyed by all those in attendance. A glass was raised to those from the year group who are no longer here and a “just giving” page was created for donations to be made to Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation in their memory. DJ Steven James, was one of the pupils from the year group and did a great job spinning the decks and taking everyone back two decades. The event was staged by the now Lynda McFarlane, Mhairi Lammie (Miller) and Vicki Cameron. Mhairi said: “Several months of planning by a small dedicated group of former pupils paid off spectacularly. “My only complaint is that the evening was over all too quickly.” Ben Glasgow added: “It was fantastic meeting up with so many people from our year group in the same room at the one time. “The dancefloor and bar did very brisk business.” DJ Steven James summed it up when he said: “It was slightly surreal looking out at a dance floor full of people that I hadn’t seen in such a long time. “By the end of the night, I felt like any barriers or negative preconceptions had been broken down. It’s amazing what a little progressive samba (and alcohol) can do.” Do you have a human interest story that you would like to feature in the Ayrshire Post then give us a call on 01292 294463Like us on

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The scenes were filmed at Yellowcraig Beach and two houses in Haddington, as well as some filming at Pease Bay in the Scottish Borders \u0026ndash all to promote Aldi\u0027s \u0027Special Buys\u0027.  The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.  In past years, East Lothian has been the backdrop for films including The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg\u0027s The BFG. The county also been used as a filming location for several adverts and many TV series, including the popular show Outlander.  Dave Neilson produced the Aldi advert via his award-winning company Filming Scotland.  When asked if he would return to East Lothian to film in the future, he said: \"Absolutely, there are so many locations that fit into a lot of the creative briefs we get through.  \"Also its good facilities and close proximity to Edinburgh it makes it an easy option in term of logistics.  \"In addition, the council are great at jumping on film requests quickly and give a very personal service so again that goes a long way to making the film process smooth.\"  Councillor John McMillan, cabinet spokesperson for economic development and tourism, said: \"It is extremely beneficial for filming to take place in East Lothian as it helps put East Lothian on the map both in terms of attracting other film companies and for potential tourists seeing our beautiful county on screen.  \"Obviously, it also helps our economy by safeguarding jobs in the hospitality industry and local shops, which all help to service film crews and sometimes even big stars!  \"I\u0027m delighted to hear Dave\u0027s positive comments about filming here and it just shows that our film charter has created an efficient partnership-working atmosphere and that can only be a good thing for East Lothian.\"  Rosie Ellison, head of Film Edinburgh, the film office for Edinburgh, East Lothian and the Scottish Borders, said: \"East Lothian has long been a popular destination for filmmakers, with East Lothian Council working in partnership with the region\u0027s film office Film Edinburgh since the mid-1990s, together assuring a film-friendly response to over 400 productions, including feature films Mary Queen of Scots, Outlaw King, Under The Skin, The Railway Man, TV dramas Outlander and Case Histories, and adverts for Chinese water company Ganten and now Aldi.\"  The Aldi advert can be seen online at youtube/watch?v=zRyK6ped4Eg"},{"url":null,"title":"better-if-boat-had-sunk-says-skipper-after-running-aground-at-prestonpans","story":"  Carl Ramsay said he was appalled by the abuse he claims he suffered at the hands of some locals after finding himself stranded on the beach at Prestonpans.  And he claimed his attempts to repair his stricken vessel were scuppered by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which denied him permission to move to nearby Cockenzie Harbour to carry out the work.  Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it. I\u0027d have been better off if it had gone down at sea, rather than coming aground here.\"  Mr Ramsay\u0027s boat the Reaper II ran aground after suffering damage while four miles off Prestonpans beach at the end of last month.  He believes the 45ft vessel was struck by a submarine or whale after it was lifted out of the water by an impact.  It suffered additional damage after striking rocks as it beached at the town.  He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8124595.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cctv-considered-to-combat-foresters-park-vandals","story":"  Enjoyleisure, which manages the park on behalf of East Lothian Council, has confirmed it is looking at the possibility of introducing CCTV across the facility.  The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.  Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

Mr Harris said: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives must be needlessly lost before the Government acts on drink-driving?  \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos figures show that drink-driving is an increasing blight on British roads and yet the Government sits on its hands and refuses to address the issue.  \u0026ldquoBrake is calling for the Government to implement an effective zero tolerance drink-drive limit of 20mg per 100ml of blood, making clear to drivers that not a drop of alcohol is safe."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8127125.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bt-creating-more-than-1000-jobs-in-bid-to-provide-best-support-to-customers","story":"  The adviser roles will be created across BT\u0026rsquos consumer division in the UK and Ireland to fulfil its promise to provide the \u0026ldquobest and most personal support for customers.

The increase is the second for British Gas customers this year, after the company announced in April that it was increasing its prices by an average 5.5% from May 29 for both its SVT and its new Temporary Tariff fixed-rate deal, which replaced the standard tariff at the end of March.  The company blamed the latest increase on a 20% rise in the costs of buying wholesale energy since April.  Which? managing director of home products and services Alex Neill said: \"This second price rise within the space of a few months will be infuriating for customers who have now seen their bills hiked by an average of \u0026pound104 in six months.  \"They should take the power back into their own hands and radically change how much they pay, simply by choosing a better deal. Before the energy price cap comes into effect later this year, customers still stuck on poor value standard tariffs should look to switch now as they could potentially save almost \u0026pound400 a year.\"  Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: \"A second significant price hike in the space of a year will be a bitter pill to swallow for hard-pressed British Gas customers.  \"Those people most likely to be on a standard variable tariff - including the elderly, people on low incomes and those with disabilities - will particularly struggle to cope with yet another bill increase.  \"While the Government\u0027s proposed price cap should protect customers from the worst of these tariffs, anyone who isn\u0027t happy with their energy company should think about switching tariff or supplier.\"  Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica Consumer, said: \"We understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers\u0027 household bills. However, this reflects the sharp rise in wholesale energy costs.  \"In response to rapidly rising wholesale market costs, since April a number of other energy supply companies have increased their SVT prices and Ofgem have also announced a second increase to the prepayment meter cap.\"  The increase comes a day after the energy regulator increased its price cap on variable tariffs due to rising wholesale prices.  Ofgem said its safeguard tariff, which protects five million households from overcharging, will rise by \u0026pound47 per year in October to \u0026pound1,136.  An Ofgem spokesman said: \"While we had to increase the level of the safeguard tariff yesterday due to higher wholesale prices, these households are still better off and can be confident that they are protected from unfair price rises.  \"The way we set this safeguard tariff is open and transparent. We encourage British Gas to be as transparent with its own customers in explaining why they have chosen to increase customer bills rather than absorbing any extra costs themselves.  \"Those British Gas customers who are not satisfied should consider switching to a better deal to make savings of hundreds of pounds.\"  Rik Smith, from price comparison site uSwitch, said: \"British Gas\u0027 standard tariff was already one of the most expensive tariffs on the market. There\u0027s now a feeling that British Gas is hiding behind Ofgem\u0027s prepayment price cap increase to hike its own prices again.\"  Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: \"The energy companies have gone way too far in ripping off their customers.  \"If it wasn\u0027t for the Government\u0027s delay in implementing their promised energy price cap, customers would have been protected from this rise. Now, the cap will not be coming into force until later this year and energy companies are hiking their tariffs before it does.\"  A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said a new price cap would be introduce by this winter to combat \"poor value tarrifs\".  He said : \"It is disappointing that British Gas has announced another price rise in its default tariff at a time customers are already paying more than they need to.\""},{"url":null,"title":"landowners-agree-pilot-scheme-to-reintroduce-lynx-to-scotland","story":"  The Lynx UK Trust has applied for a licence for a trial reintroduction of Eurasian lynx to Kielder Forest, in Northumberland.  The Trust says 270 square miles of potential lynx habitat has been approved for a five-year trial involving a first release of six animals fitted with state-of-the-art GPS collars to monitor their movements.  If successful, it could lead to a wider reintroduction of the carnivorous cats in other parts of the UK, such as Argyll and Inverness-shire.  The trust has already identified an area of \u0026ldquosuitable lynx habitat covering over 10,000 square miles, as close as 30 miles to Glasgow, and consultation is already under way with several major landowners.  Supporters of the reintroduction of lynx say the native species would bring a range of benefits including helping to control deer through direct predation and by keeping deer herds moving through the forestry.  Analysis of similar projects in Europe suggests the animals could also help generate tens of millions of pounds in tourism.  Dr Paul O\u0026rsquoDonoghue, chief scientific adviser for the Lynx UK Trust, said: \u0026ldquoI think this (support from landowners) speaks volumes for the confidence in the trial reintroduction plan we\u0026rsquove laid out, and the potential it has for improving the local ecosystem and expanding the local tourist economy. Literally every landowner we have approached has given permission.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove got an incredible team of ecologists, four wildlife vets and highly experienced reintroduction specialists ready to start work, with a combined 300 years of experience between them.  \u0026ldquoThis will be an exceptionally rigorous, scientifically-led reintroduction trial using cutting edge technology to monitor these cats in stunning detail.  \u0026ldquoEverything is in place to deliver a project that will breathe life into Britain\u0026rsquos dying forest ecosystems.  Dr O\u0026rsquoDonoghue said that while the proposed release site is in Northumberland, it was a \u0026ldquocross-border project that could see lynx involved in the trial cross in to Scotland.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a cross-border site. Landowners on the Scottish and English sides have given access so lynx could be on Scottish soil. But we are also assessing Scottish sites in the Highlands and we see this trial as a precursor to rolling out a larger introduction in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThere is fantastic habitat as close as 30 miles from Glasgow, from Loch Lomond and the Trossachs into the West Highlands and the Great Glen. Lynx specialise on roe deer, of which Scotland has a massive overabundance \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a massive larder for the lynx."},{"url":null,"title":"document-suggests-snp-ministers-did-not-support-a-permanent-fracking-ban","story":"  Previously unseen papers state ministers do not \u0026ldquosupport the notion of a permanent ban because technology could improve and public attitudes may shift in the future.  The position stands in stark contrast to the later statements of senior SNP figures, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisting: \u0026ldquoFracking is being banned in Scotland, end of story.  Scottish Liberal Democrat energy spokesman Liam McArthur said it \u0026ldquodoes not say a lot for the way in which the Scottish Government has handled this policy that even at the 11th hour officials did not know whether ministers intended to permanently ban fracking or not.  He added: \"Moreover, there will be more than a few eyebrows raised in the communities who were promised that the threat of fracking had been removed, only to find out that the Government\u0027s promise potentially came with an asterisk attached.\"  Ministers introduced a moratorium on fracking, which involves pumping water and chemicals at high pressure into shale beds to release gas, in 2015.  Research found it could be worth an estimated \u0026pound1.2 billion to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy over the period to 2062, but critics argue it contributes to climate change and poses a public health risk.  Official documents released under Freedom of Information, written just days before energy minister Paul Wheelhouse outlined the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos final position on fracking in October, detail how ministers planned to announce their \u0026ldquocarefully considered judgement.  It said the Government does not back the development of a fracking industry in Scotland.  But it adds that Mr Wheelhouse should \u0026ldquoset out that the Scottish Government does not support the notion of a permanent ban as it is impossible to predict with any certainty what kind of clean energy technologies may be available in the decades to come, or future public attitudes.  Mr Wheelhouse made no mention of this in his statement to MSPs less than two weeks later. Instead, he said fracking had been \u0026ldquoeffectively banned, adding: \u0026ldquoThe decision that I am announcing means that fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland.  Challenged by Green MSP Mark Ruskell over whether this amounted to a permanent ban, Mr Wheelhouse said he was \u0026ldquotaken aback and suggested Mr Ruskell had not been listening.  He went on: \u0026ldquoI give reassurance \u0026ndash I tried to make it crystal clear in my statement \u0026ndash that there is, in effect, a ban on unconventional oil and gas activities in Scotland.  Earlier this year, a Scottish Government lawyer told a court it had not in fact banned fracking, insisting this was \"the language of a press statement\". It said the policymaking process is still ongoing, while ministers had simply announced \"a preferred position\".  Opponents accused the SNP of hedging its bets instead of implementing a real ban.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos environment spokesperson Claudia Beamish MSP said it was time for the SNP to \"respect the vote of the Scottish Parliament and show its clear commitment to a real ban of on-shore fracking in Scotland.  Mr Ruskell said: \"The change in tone between the Sir Humphrey-style hedge-your-bets briefing and Paul Wheelhouse\u0027s bullish statement shows that SNP ministers knew that they could sit on the fence no longer.\"  Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said there was \u0026ldquoclearly a lot of furious debate within the Government in the days leading up to the announcement of a ban.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted that fracking cannot take place in Scotland but we want the Scottish Government to go beyond the current ban in policy and enact a water-tight ban in law.  A Government spokesman said the \u0026ldquohandling plan was written by officials to provide recommendations, adding that Mr Wheelhouse \u0026ldquodid not agree with the specific recommendation referred to, and so did not include it in his statement.  He added: \u0026ldquoAs Mr Wheelhouse has repeatedly made clear in parliament, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos preferred position is not to support unconventional oil and gas extraction in Scotland. This position has been endorsed by MSPs of all parties and we are currently completing the Strategic Environmental Assessment of our preferred policy.  He said the Government had not been opposed to a permanent ban when the document was written, but did not explain how this continued to be included in the handling plan, weeks after ministers had met to discuss their stance."},{"url":null,"title":"homebase-to-close-80-more-stores-with-2000-jobs-lost","story":"  The DIY chain is next week expected to announce it will file for a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA), a controversial insolvency procedure used by struggling firms to shut under-performing stores.  Restructuring experts at Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal will carry out the CVA.  The Press Association first reported in June that Homebase was exploring further store closures through the procedure.  Homebase would have to secure the support of landlords to carry out a CVA.  But the property industry has expressed consternation at the procedure, which has been adopted by the likes of House of Fraser, Carpetright and Mothercare, saying it leaves them out-of-pocket.  The latest restructuring would come on top of a store closure programme the retailer has been carrying out since February.  A total of 17 Homebase stores have been shut this year and the business has also axed 303 jobs at its head office in Milton Keynes.  The store closures follow the sale of the business by its former Australian owner Wesfarmers to Hilco, a retail turnaround specialist, for \u0026pound1.  Homebase was bought by Wesfarmers for \u0026pound340 million in 2016.  Wesfarmers is known for its Bunnings chain in Australia, and attempted to import the home improvement brand to the UK by converting a host of Homebase stores into the Bunnings format.  However, the fast pace of the transition gave Wesfarmers little time to introduce the Bunnings brand, which is highly successful in Australia, to UK consumers.

The Polish-born French scientist, who became the first person to win two Nobel prizes - one for physics and one for chemistry - carried out important research into radioactivity, a term that she coined.  Her discoveries launched effective cures for cancer and helped in the development of X-rays in surgery.  The magazine asked experts in 10 different fields of human endeavour to each nominate 10 women they believe had the biggest impact, to create the list of 100 women for readers to choose from.  Curie\u0027s nominee, Patricia Fara, president of the British Society for the History of Science, said: \"She (Curie) was the first woman to win a Nobel prize in physics, first female professor at the University of Paris, and the first person - note the use of person there, not woman - to win a second Nobel prize.  \"The odds were always stacked against her. In Poland her patriotic family suffered under a Russian regime. In France she was regarded with suspicion as a foreigner - and of course, wherever she went, she was discriminated against as a woman.\"  The top 100 women were chosen for their achievements in areas including politics, science, sport, technology and literature, and saw the likes of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Dame Jenni Murray and historians Suzannah Lipscomb and Tom Holland among those putting together the shortlist.  In second place was Rosa Parks, an activist in the civil rights movement who protested against racial segregation in America, with leader of the British suffragette movement Pankhurst third.  As well as Curie, scientist Ada Lovelace, a computer programmer and mathematician, and crystallographer Rosalind Franklin made the top 20, in fourth and fifth places respectively.  The UK\u0027s first female Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, is in sixth place, while Diana, Princess of Wales, is at number 15.  Other names in the top 20 include writers Mary Wollstonecraft and Jane Austen, aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart and queens Victoria and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  BBC History Magazine deputy editor Charlotte Hodgman said: \"The poll has shone a light on some truly extraordinary women from history, many of whose achievements and talents were overlooked in their own lifetimes.  \"It is fitting that, in a year that has seen the 100th anniversary of the parliamentary Act that gave the vote to many British women, suffrage campaigners Emmeline Pankhurst and Josephine Butler have been voted into the top 20.  \"Whilst it is unsurprising to see queens such as Victoria and Eleanor of Aquitaine place high, it is refreshing to see some more unfamiliar names make the top 20, such as 19th-century philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts.

And just five days ago, Rangers manager Steven Gerrard, only 90 minutes into his new job, blamed the referee for their draw against Aberdeen.  Now, we can imagine Gerrard has learned the art of the Scottish football blame partly from his old boss, Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers.  In suggesting yesterday that the Celtic board are slow to shove hands into shallow trouser pockets to pay for new arrivals, the manager is making sure he is absolved of blame if the team doesn\u0026rsquot make the European cut. (Of course, he may well have a point. And just watch Gerrard adopt the same tactic in the coming weeks.)  There is little doubt however politicians have long been masters of blame. Donald Trump cleverly uses this art to deflect from election fixing, tax avoidance, sex scandals etc, and closer to home recently we\u0026rsquove seen Jeremy Corbyn supporters blame right-wingers for the Jewish debacle and Theresa May blame everyone but herself for having no Brexit plan.  But students of Blame should study carefully how not to overuse. This week, the Russian synchronised swimming team blamed European Championship organisers for \u0026ldquopoisoning their ladies by adding too much chlorine, their swimmers having to compete \u0026ldquoblind.  This blaming was a little excessive. We Scots have been brought up to expect the upper levels of chlorination, (perhaps linked to our tradition of wee boys peeing in pools) and given the Russians actually won gold, we smiled knowing this was really retaliation for claims of Novichoking.  Students of Blame, however, should understand it can be a very useful device for soliciting empathy with the easily offended. Take the recent case of poet Anders Carlson-Wee. The white poet stood accused of cultural appropriation after he used black dialect to assume the voice of a female homeless person in American magazine, The Nation.  Now, what Blame students should note was this wasn\u0026rsquot an Ali G mickey take, this was a clever, thoughtful poem. Yet, it was easy for the blamers out there to force an apology from the magazine \u0026ndash and the writer himself, who each accepted their share of the blame. Triple blame achieved, all for transgressing (spurious) literary rules of good behaviour!  On a similar note, TV football pundit Ian Wright was blamed for cultural abuse, indeed his remarks reported to Ofcom after the former Gunner kicked at the ankles of Roy Keane\u0026rsquos Irish accent.  Now, Ofcom booted the complaints out of the park, so factor this in you blamers: Plato established a breakthrough in philosophy when he recognized that a linguistic sign is not the same thing as the signified. Many others came to accept this. So if you\u0026rsquore going to blame, pick easier targets. Pick the naive poets.  And once you come to understand the principles of blaming you may wish to consider a career in Law, where blame and personal development can work hand in hand. How does this work? Well, chartered psychologist Dr Angela Summerfield argued that because we are told we can all realise our dreams, that everything is within our grasp, when we learn this isn\u0026rsquot the case we come to the conclusion someone else is responsible. This could be the supermarket that sells you the hundred weight of crisps each week, which means you drive a mobility scooter, or the trainer company which forgot to attach a Tie Your Laces warning.  But don\u0026rsquot think to exploit smart, bold companies such as tree activity centre Go Ape, where you can Tarzan wonderfully with your children. This week, I learned organisers announce (to paraphase) that if you don\u0026rsquot connect your safety wires and you fall out of the tree you only have yourself to blame.    What you blamers out there should also factor in is that society seems to be imposing a statute of limitations on culpability. Dame Joan Collins has recently been mumping her 85-year-old (but still wonderfully shaped) gums about how she blames Warren Beatty for her missing out on an Oscar, having turned down Sons and Lovers in 1960.  Seems lover boy read the script and declared it to be \u0026ldquoAbsolute crap. But no one will blame anyone but Joanie who should have focused less on keeping frisky Beatty happy in bed and more on reading the Lawrence script attentively.  So be selective with your blaming: I\u0026rsquove tried blaming my tennis partner for being ten years younger, my ex-partner for not being a mind reader and my mother for not allowing me once to self-identify as The Batman. Each failed.  Be better blamers. If you wish to wear the crown of victimhood while casting around for those to implicate when things go wrong be smart about it.

In her letter, Mrs May recognised Tory concerns that her proposal for a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook with the EU on goods would stop the UK doing trade deals, but insisted \u0026ldquothis is not the case \u0026ndash and I would not be proposing it if it would.  Mrs May said talks with the EU had reached an \u0026ldquoimpasse, as both of the options on offer from Brussels \u0026ndash a standard free trade agreement or an EEA-style customs union \u0026ndash were \u0026ldquonot acceptable to me or to the United Kingdom.  The only way to break the deadlock was to \u0026ldquoget the EU to consider a third option, but they will only do that if we put forward proposals they find credible, she said.  She said getting a good deal would require \u0026ldquopragmatism and compromise from both sides.  But she insisted: \u0026ldquoThis vision for our future relationship with the EU will be very challenging for the EU \u0026ndash it is in no sense a concession to their demands.  \u0026ldquoI have been very clear that we are rejecting the two models they have put forward.\u0026nbspInstead, we are asking them to accept a bespoke model which meets the unique requirements of the United Kingdom.  The letter included messages of support for the Chequers plan from leading Leave-backing ministers Liam Fox, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom, as well as Chancellor Philip Hammond, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and party chairman Brandon Lewis."},{"url":null,"title":"ian-paisley-recall-petition-opens-in-co-antrim","story":"  The senior Democratic Unionist was suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days over his failure to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan Government.

Mr Paisley has already apologised for what he said was his \u0026ldquounintentional failure to register the hospitality.  He has vowed to fight any by-election campaign.  Three petition centres were opened across North Antrim but Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann has criticised the Electoral Office\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquolimited provision.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Ulster Unionist Party will not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but we would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition and allow the entire North Antrim electorate to have their say.  He added: \u0026ldquoI believe the findings of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards are so serious and go to such an extent that the only option is for a by-election to be called.  The petition can be signed at centres in Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle.

It features six bedrooms and bathrooms, two lounges, a cinema room, a gym, a wine room, plus four acres of grounds, including a one and a half acre lake stocked with more than 2,000 fish.  Current owners Nigel and Melanie Walsh said a difficult property market, Brexit and Stamp Duty were hurdles to achieving a sale, so after nine months decided to adopt a creative approach.

And in its former lifetime, it has also been used as a school and by the Army as Camp 33 to house Italian prisoners of war in the grounds.  The couple, who have been married for 42 years, have also held birthdays, family gatherings and even their son\u0026rsquos wedding at their property.  Asked who she would like to win the competition, Ms Walsh said: \u0026ldquoSomeone who will love it as much as we have.  \u0026ldquoThe people who are buying tickets and entering, I hope and I really mean this sincerely, that they are looking forward to winning Dancers Hill House.  \u0026ldquoI would like to see it go to a family who are going to cherish it and have as much fun as we have, and I hope we succeed.

Campbell died aged 45 on Coniston Water in the Lake District in January 1967 when the boat, travelling at more than 300mph, flipped into the air and disintegrated as he attempted to beat his own water speed record.  The restored hydroplane, which was recovered from the lake in 2001, has been undergoing tests at speed on Loch Fad on the Isle of Bute.  Asked if any world record speed attempts were planned, Mr Smith said: \u0026ldquoThat would be incredibly foolish.  \u0026ldquoYou saw what happened last time.

Nah.  He has spent 22 years restoring the boat, which has a new jet engine, along with volunteers but said the history was not at the forefront of his mind when she re-entered the water for the first time in more than half a century at the weekend.  He said: \u0026ldquoI just wanted to know that she wasn\u0026rsquot filling up with water and about to land on the bottom with her tail fin sticking above the surface.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos all I wanted to see.

He hinted that the historic boat could become a regular visitor to the island, once this month\u0026rsquos test runs are over.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod come back and do it every year, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos like going on holiday with my mates and bringing a boat along for a laugh.

He said archive footage has enabled the team to mirror Campbell\u0026rsquos progress.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos pretty interesting to see the boat is peforming in a pretty similar way to when Donald Campbell had it.

Scottish Conservative MSP Peter Chapman this week challenged First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to tell farmers if she is in favour of the restrictions planned for the route and urged her to support overturning the ban.                                                    His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Thursday 9 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Thursday 9 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services by around 20% for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Thursday 9 Aug 2018

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Thursday 9 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Thursday 9 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Who’s Who in Scotland 2018 has just been published – at a price of £75  (a snip). It is not a book that will get a large number of reviews, I suspect, as many reviewers might find it difficult to find anything to say about it. What are they to write? “This book is short on plot but very strong on characters – there are 5,000 of them ...” Or, perhaps, “the alphabetical structure of Who’s Who in Scotland has much to recommend it ...”             This book, however, makes excellent reading and shows us just what a fascinating and peculiar country we live in. Take people’s private pursuits, for example: at the end of each entry there is a heading “recreations” and it is here that people disclose, usually in two or three words, what they get up to when they aren’t doing all the distinguished things mentioned in the main body of their entry. A trawl through the pages of Who’s Who in Scotland reveals that travel and walking are probably the most popular activities. Entrants do not disclose, though, where they are travelling to, nor indeed where they are walking and why. But distinguished Scots are certainly travelling and walking in great numbers.            READ MORE: Alexander McCall Smith: Should there be second referendums on Brexit and independence?Many of them state that their recreation is running. This is almost as popular as walking. Some of them may be running away from something, but this is not mentioned, which is probably just as well. One entrant, a politician, lists his recreations as rugby, family, and whisky (in that order). Jamie Byng, publisher of Canongate, reports his recreations as tennis, cooking, deejaying, reading, and drinking. Another, a minister of the Kirk, includes amongst his recreations wining and dining and visiting Vienna and York. Vienna and York would be tame destinations, though, for an earlier entry which records, amongst others, the following expeditions: East Greenland (1966) Elephant Island, Antarctica, 1970-71, and Everest in 1976.Recreations aside, it is encouraging to see that there are very large numbers of accomplished people in Scotland – undoubtedly rather more than one might expect in a country of Scotland’s size. If one is of the ‘wha’s like us’ school, one will find plenty of proof here of one’s thesis. After all, here we find Brown, Rt Hon (James) Gordon, Prime Minister Darling of Roulanish, Baron (Alistair Maclean Darling), Chancellor of the Exchequer and Higgs, Professor Peter Ware (recreations, music, walking and swimming) who started off with the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society in 1981 and ended up with the Nobel Prize in 2013. All three of these are people of immense achievement, but their entries are characteristically modest, which is encouraging. Scotland has never been noted for a fondness for bragging, and this is reflected in Who’s Who in Scotland. There is room for everybody in this volume, even those whose role in life is to be a local councillor or the deputy-head of a primary school. And why not? Civic life depends on people who undertake these roles. They may not be the most glamorous callings, but they are at the heart of our society and should be applauded, cherished, and duly recorded in books like this. Such people are worth any number of celebrities.  READ MORE: Famous discovery has ‘ruined my life’, says Professor HiggsThe gentry and above are here, all right, although they are, by and large, discreet – even diffident about their lineage. After all, Scottish nobles have been a somewhat rapacious lot throughout our history, and it is understandable that their descendants should limit themselves to only three or four lines in Who’s Who in Scotland. They often describe their occupation as farmer, but of course the real situation is given away by their recreations which are usually listed as hunting and fishing. The more tactful will write country sports, but we all know that does not include mah jong. Their addresses also reveal what’s what. They usually live in a House, or, quite often, a Castle. On the subject of addresses, the McEwens of Muck are not in this volume, which is a pity. The MacEwen family has the most wonderful address ever: McEwen, Muck, Scotland. And Andy Murray is not here either, which is odd, although everyone knows that his recreation is tennis."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4780818.1533739806!/image/image.jpg","title":"john swinney the evidence shows scottish education is first class","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

A rolling lock change eviction process for those not given refugee status had been announced by accommodation provider Serco.            The firm, contracted by the Home Office, announced a temporary reprieve on the plans last week in the face of legal challenges and protests.            Now the Scottish Government has given £110,000 to the Destitute Asylum Seeker Service.It will allow three partner charities to double their capacity to support people and provide accommodation, over six months.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: “While we welcome the pause in the issue of lock change notices, this is only a temporary measure, and the fact remains that destitution and homelessness are built into the current asylum system - placing hundreds of people at risk.“The plight of people threatened with eviction demands a resolute and humanitarian approach and we cannot see people turned on to the streets because of the failure of the Home Office’s asylum policy.“We all have a moral duty to do what we can to help those most in need and this additional funding, while a short-term solution, will provide urgent assistance needed.”            After Serco announced the lock change plans last month, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken wrote to Home Secretary Sajid Javid warning it risks a “humanitarian crisis”, leaving those affected out on the streets.The contractor denies the claim and said it currently pays accommodation for 330 asylum seekers who no longer receive Home Office support.About a third have been granted leave to remain while the remainder have been refused refugee status.Eviction plans affect the latter group, which the firm says have no right to remain in the UK.            A Home Office spokeswoman said: “It is important that we ensure failed asylum seekers are getting the information they need about the support available to them once their asylum process comes to an end.“How we work together to do this has been a key part of the discussions the Immigration Minister has been having with Serco, Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4781015.1533759067!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland s legal chiefs face calls to review flagship laws on upskirting","story":"        Scotland\u0026#8217s legal chiefs are facing calls to review flagship laws introduced to tackle so-called \u0026#8220upskirting\u0026#8221 amid concerns that loopholes in the legislation are behind \u0026#8220very low\u0026#8221 prosecution rates.                 The Lord Advocate is being urged to step in after it emerged barely three convictions a year have been secured since the laws came into force with “limitations” in Scotland.             Campaigners claim images that are shared on social media for “group bonding” purposes or sold for financial gain, to a magazine or newspaper, can escape prosecution. \u2028One teaching union has warned the laws introduced in Scotland at start of the decade are not working and want mobile phones banned in schools because of the growing problem of pupils using them to take inappropriate photographs. Official figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show there have never been more than five prosecutions or convictions for upskirting, or covertly taking revealing photographs of victims.             Prosecutions have averaged 3.5 per year, with just 3.2 convictions, since 2011. Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur has written to the head of Scotland’s prosecution service, the Lord Advocate Lord Wolffe, raising concerns about the issue and questioning whether guidance to prosecutors remains “fit for purpose”.The prospect of the “very low numbers” being down to low instances of the offence is described as “counter-intuitive” by the Orkney MSP.He said: “There may be some procedural or legal obstacle preventing a more representative number of cases being brought forward and disposed of by the courts.“As you will appreciate, if such obstacles do exist the risk is that those who are victims of this unpleasant and distressing behaviour will be less willing to come forward with complaints in future.“I would welcome, therefore, your views on whether or not the law in this area, and guidance to prosecutors, remains fit for purpose.”            Figures obtained by the party through Parliamentary answers at Holyrood reveal there were just three prosecutions and three convictions in 2016/17, down from five in each category the previous year. In 2014/15, the figures dropped to just two prosecutions and one conviction.Upskirting was banned as a specific offence in Scotland in 2010 and similar measures are in the process of being introduced south of the Border when MPs return to Westminster later this year. The process was marked by controversy when Tory backbencher Sir Christopher Chote recently “talked out” a private members Bill that would have achieved the ban.The proposed English legislation will largely mirror the law in Scotland, but amendments have been proposed to tighten up the Bill after “limitations” were identified in the Scottish legislation.Clare McGlynn, a professor of law at Durham University who specialises in the regulation of pornography, image-based sexual abuse, including ‘revenge porn’, and sexual violence, has been working with MPs on the proposed changes.             She said the current law in Scotland only covers upskirting where it is perpetrated for motives of sexual gratification or causing distress.“That covers a lot of situations, but it doesn’t cover every single instance of upskirting,” she said.“So the debate in England has been, for example, about two main scenarios that might not be covered. One is where someone might take images for financial gain and say, sell them to a magazine.”\u2028She added: “The other major scenario that isn’t necessarily covered is that many of these sorts of images that are taken and are traded amongst groups of men who are trading them not to cause distress to the other person, and it’s not generally about sexual gratification either, it’s about their group bonding.“You see this with revenge porn images as well, often in closed Facebook groups, What’sApp groups. They’re taking and sharing the images amongst themselves. Sometimes they don’t care who the victim is. Often they don’t want the victim to know so you can’t say that they’re doing it to cause distress to the victim. If you have a law which says they have to prove that the perpetrator intended to cause distress to the victim, it doesn’t cover everything basically.”This becomes “another hurdle” which police and prosecutors have to overcome in trying to secure a conviction, according to the academic.             Prof McGlynn has already appeared before Westminster committees scrutinising the issue and provided recommendations and suggestions. Amendments to tighten up the English legislation in this area are expected to be brought forward when MPs consider the issue after the return of Parliament in September. Previous attempts to address the issue through amendments have been rejected at the opening committee stage when the government used its majority to vote them down.A Scottish Government spokesman said in addition to the specific “upskirting” ban north of the Border, a new offence was established last year of sharing “intimate images” without consent under the Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Act which was backed by a high profile media campaign to raise awareness.“Action can be taken and support is available to anyone  experiencing these types of crime,” the spokesman said."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"37 bruce crescent lerwick ze1 0pb ","story":"Offers over £167,000\n\n Externally: Off-road parking, a large front, side and back garden and an outside bin store.\nThe property is in move into condition.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK.

Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 9 Aug 2018 10:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hockey hero lizzie colvin back at work after world cup","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The last few weeks have been so much fun and, most importantly, we have enjoyed every moment.\"\n\nThe former Armagh player now has a new fan club at Belfast law firm DWF, where she works as a solicitor, having moved back home last year after seven years with Dublin side Loreto.\n\nLizzie says she is extremely grateful to her employers for their understanding of the commitments that come with being an international hockey player. \n\n\"Thankfully my boss Ken Rutherford, who has played hockey for Ulster and Ireland, was very supportive when I told him that I was going to the World Cup,\" she said.\n\n\"I had told him it would probably only be a two-week tournament, as we would get knocked out. He had been following our progress and realised that I was going to be off for a bit longer, so in the end it was four weeks. The great reception everyone gave me and all of their lovely messages certainly made it a lot easier going back to the office. A lot of my co-workers who knew very little about hockey have taken a great interest in it, so we\u0027ve got a few more fans in the office now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIreland\u0027s goalkeeping great Ayeisha McFerran (right) is congratulated by Grace O\u0027Flanagan after her shoot-out heroics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike several members of the Ireland squad, Lizzie has had to juggle her hockey ambitions with the demands of full-time work. In the build-up to the World Cup in London the Ireland players were training five times a week.\n\nLizzie has been proudly displaying the silver medal she won at the event, but is still unsure about where it will ultimately take pride of place. \n\n\"Some people have told me that I should get it framed, but I would prefer to have it always ready to go, in case people want to have a closer look. It\u0027s got a few teeth marks in it at the moment from all the pictures, so I\u0027ll need to give it a good polish,\" she said. \n\nThe Belfast Harlequins midfielder, who has been capped more than 160 times, says she inherited her love of hockey from her mum Rosie, who, along with her sister, is a former player. \n\nLizzie got engaged to South African Matthew Holden in Salzburg, Austria, back on January 5, her 28th birthday, and the pair are planning to wed in late 2019.\n\nShe joked earlier this week that her father Peter might have to increase the wedding budget to accommodate 17 extra bridesmaids made up of her team-mates.\n\nWhile wedding plans will be next on the agenda, for now Lizzie is taking a well-earned rest from hockey, although escaping the sight of a pitch isn\u0027t easy.\n\n\"I live right beside the Harlequins ground, so I can see the pitch from my bedroom window - but I won\u0027t be venturing onto it for a while,\" she added. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"more 12hour glider belfast bus lanes to operate from","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

new planning application for the Grand Opera House in Belfast has revealed that a previous £10.5m extension had limited success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe \u0027Act 2\u0027 extension to the main building was opened in 2006, but according to the Grand Opera House Trust it has failed to meet expectations.\n\nAt the time the Arts Council of Northern Ireland had contributed £2.3m to the project.\n\nNow the trust has submitted plans for a major revamp of the Act 2 extension, along with upgrading the main facilities.\n\nIt\u0027s hoped the work can be completed before the Opera House\u0027s 125th anniversary in 2020 and the application calls it \"a once in a generation opportunity to restore the auditorium to its former grandeur\".\n\nThe Act 2 building currently provides the Baby Grand Space, which hosts smaller performances and functions.\n\nIt also provides extra facilities for front of house, bleacher seating and bars at different levels.\n\nThe planning application said that although the relatively new extension provides \"much needed accommodation\", it required work to improve ambience and customer satisfaction to \"better reflect the quality\" of the main auditorium.\n\nKey issues with the current accommodation include \"poor quality\" public realm and entrance area with \"a cluttered and confusing arrangement of services\".\n\nIn addition, the trust said the internal layout led to bottlenecks at key facilities such as bars, toilets, staircases and, in particular, the auditorium entrances.\n\nIt added: \"There is a lack of continuity of theme or style between the original theatre and heritage to the Act 2 accommodation and many of the linking spaces are poor quality.\"\n\nThe problems were also affecting income, with the application saying the Baby Grand, Hippodrome Room and Shakespeare Room are all currently under-utilised and \"not fulfilling their potential\".\n\nThe BBC said the trust is also plans to use part of the reworked space as a permanent exhibition on the theatre\u0027s history.\n\nThe project also proposes to revamp the main auditorium with new seats, ceiling decoration and upgraded sound, lighting and stage facilities.\n\nIt\u0027s not known how much the proposed refurbishments would cost at this stage, but it\u0027s reported a restoration levy on ticket prices since 2011 will contribute to the \"significant

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"time drawing near for ireland border poll sinn feins mcdonald tells hunger strike event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pound continues slide as britain stares into brexit abyss","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

euros.\n\nConnor Campbell, financial analyst at SpreadEx, said: “The fears of a no-deal Brexit have really gathered steam in the last few sessions, a snowball effect stemming from Mark Carney and Liam Fox’s warnings either side of the weekend.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMr Fox, the Trade Secretary, said over the weekend that the chances of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement in place is becoming more of a reality.\n\nHe believes that a no-deal Brexit is now more likely than an agreed withdrawal, putting the odds at “60-40”.\n\nHis comments echoed those Bank of England Governor Mark Carney last week.\n\nSterling is likely to plummet further if fears of “no deal” materialise, something analysts believe is a real possibility.\n\nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC, said: “Whether you believe such a scenario is likely or not, such is the incompetence of this Government, as well as its Opposition, investors would be foolhardy not to take some steps to hedge against such an outcome.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"people are loving this new zealand librarys creative memeinspired poster","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

has marked the anniversary of the world’s second atomic bombing with the United Nations’ chief and the city’s mayor urging global leaders to take concrete steps toward world nuclear disarmament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nSecretary-general Antonio Guterres, the first United Nations chief to visit Nagasaki, said fears of nuclear war are still present 73 years after the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings and that they should never be repeated.\n\nHe raised concerns about the slowing effort to denuclearise, saying existing nuclear states are modernising their arsenals.\n\n\n\nLet us all commit to making Nagasaki the last place on earth to suffer nuclear devastation\nAntonio Guterres, UN secretary general\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“Disarmament processes have slowed and even come to a halt,” Mr Guterres told the audience at the Nagasaki peace park.\n\n“Here in Nagasaki, I call on all countries to commit to nuclear disarmament and to start making visible progress as a matter of urgency.”\n\nThen he added: “Let us all commit to making Nagasaki the last place on earth to suffer nuclear devastation.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople sing in front of the Peace Memorial Statue at Peace Park in Nagasaki (Takuma Kaneko/Kyodo/AP)\n\n\n\n\nThe peace and nuclear disarmament movement, started by survivors of the atomic bombings, has spread around the world but frustration over the slow progress led to last year’s adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nJapan, despite being the only country in the world to have suffered nuclear attacks, has not signed the treaty, because of its sensitive position as an US ally protected by its nuclear umbrella.\n\nNagasaki mayor Tomihisa Taue urged Japan’s government to do more to lead nuclear disarmament, especially in the region to help advance the efforts to achieve a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres, at Nagasaki Peace Park (Miyuki Saito/AP)\n\n\n\n\nHe said citizens of the atomic-bombed cities are hoping to see North Korea denuclearised.\n\nMr Taue said he hoped Japan’s government would take the opportunity to realise a nuclear-free Northeast Asia, including Japan and the Korean Peninsula.\n\nMr Taue urged Tokyo to sign the treaty and “fulfil its moral obligation to lead the world towards denuclearisation”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoke billows up over Nagasaki, Japan, after the atomic bombing (US Air Force/PA)\n\n\n\n\nHe said more than 300 local assemblies have adopted resolutions calling on Japan to sign and ratify the treaty.\n\nJapan seeks to close the gaps between nuclear and non-nuclear states to eventually achieve a nuclear-free world, said prime minister Shinzo Abe, repeating almost the same phrase he used in his speech three days ago in Hiroshima.\n\nThe bombing of Nagasaki on August 9 1945 was the second US nuclear attack on Japan, killing 70,000 people, three days after the bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed 140,000.\n\nThey were followed by Japan’s surrender, ending the Second World War.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"50 new jobs created new eurospar store skeoge area derry recruitment","story":"\nA new store which is expected to open in the Skeoge area of Derry in
