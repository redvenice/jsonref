But, having worn it for 20 to 30 minutes a day, and seen improvements, he has become a paid ambassador.‘When you put it on, you can feel the way the T-shirt pulls so that your posture is set back in the right place,’ he says. ‘Usually, I wear it after exercising to put me in the right position — that seems to work for me. But it’s also helpful for my studio work.’Sitting and standing in poor positions does cause excessive strain on tissues, ligaments, muscles and tendons, leading to inflammation, pain and weakness, explains Professor Tony Kochhar, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon specialising in shoulder and upper limb surgery based at London Bridge Hospital.‘So, if you have back pain from poor posture, the shirt could offer immediate relief. This garment is designed to remind people to use their muscles in a better combination, so that their posture improves and they are less prone to muscle, tendon or ligament strains and, therefore, have less pain and weakness.

At the last funding round in October, Monzo was valued at £1bn.The app-based challenger bank, which now has 2 million users, has grown rapidly in the four years since its 2015 launch. Founder and chief executive Tom Blomfield, 33, said that number could reach 3 million within months. With no bank branch network to soak up investment cash, the company plans to use the fresh funding to expand business in the UK and overseas. It announced a US launch last month.In its home market, Monzo is particularly popular among millennial customers with a strong following among 20 to 35 year olds, mostly in Britain’s south-east. Just over a third of Monzo’s customers are aged 25 to 31 and every customer is issued a banking card in coral pink, to make them highly visible when used at the bar or coffee shop.Where Monzo has also scored is in realising that for many millennials, money is a stressful business, so it offers a multitude of services allowing people to keep tabs on what they are spending their money on and split bills with friends. They can set monthly budgets for spending on things such as groceries and going out. Customers get a notification the moment they use their card, before the receipt has even finished printing.New customers download the Monzo app on their phone, then provide a photo of a valid identity document (such as a passport or driving licence) and record a short “selfie video” for further identification.Monzo is now hoping to broaden that appeal to a larger swath of the UK market. It is ploughing money into a TV ad campaign, which is expected to take up a significant chunk of its £10-12m marketing costs this year, in a bid to pull in more and varied customers.The bank started as a pre-paid debit card. The team generated hype for its sleek app with a lengthy waitlist, and that whiff of exclusivity operated as a cunning customer lure. Wannabe customers could jump an initially lengthy queue if friends granted them one of their few “golden tickets”. Demand swelled, allowing Monzo to grow its user base exponentially despite spending virtually no cash on marketing up until this year.He acknowledges that Monzo’s appeal can be hard to grasp. “Monzo has developed this almost cult-like following where everyone’s like, ‘It just works really, really well.’ And you’re like, ‘Why?’ And they just point to a few dozen different small things that together make the whole thing better,” Blomfield said.Customers like being able to sign up digitally, instantly freeze a lost card, get immediate alerts on spending and transactions, and use the card abroad without any extra fees. As the company moves into the US, Blomfield’s strategy is to find “two dozen micro-interactions that suck, and them make them amazing ”,Fans of the business model include Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom and singer Tom Odell. Both took part in some of Monzo’s multimillion pound crowdfunding campaigns, and many of its everyday customers followed suit.Like many tech “unicorns” – new tech companies valued at more than $1bn (£0.79bn) – the bankhas yet to turn a profit. Last year its losses quadrupled to £33m. Blomfield says he is no hurry to make money: “Getting to profitability is not a goal we are prioritising over delivering customers real value. If that takes 10 years, we are committed to it,” he said..Monzo is not only taking on digital rivals such as Revolut, but also Britain’s high street banks. Lenders including HSBC, Lloyds and Barclays are scrambling to keep up with fintech upstarts. Under its Natwest brand, Royal Bank of Scotland has even launched its own standalone digital bank, operating at arms length away from old IT systems that can make it hard to innovate.As the high street lenders have been cutting costs by closing branches and axing jobs, Monzo is hiring. It now has more than 1,000 staff.Blomfield struck out on his own after a stint working at now-rival digital bank Starling. While his banking experience is otherwise thin, the founder has stacked his board with experienced bankers such as chairman Gary Hoffman. Once chief executive at Barclaycard, Hoffman is best known as the man parachuted in to stabilise Northern Rock at the beginning of the financial crisis.Blomfield is certainly ambitious: “I think at some point we will end up with multiple banking licences across the world with inidual CEOs for each of those.But “Right now,” he says, “I’m having a huge amount of fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c4ffda073aa7fab1501eb5d7d503a8be0bc20b/0_266_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ade8333b39aec8cbd886a37d5aa71b6a","title":"humans v the city the staggering scale of chongqing in pictures","story":"Chongqing’s population is estimated at just below 10 million but that rises to more than 31 million if the built-up surroundings are included.

It would be wrong to regard such warnings as a bluff. When push comes to shove, such MPs are likely to be in no mood for compromise. This attitude will have been hardened if Boris Johnson becomes party leader despite his obvious flaws – especially since Brexit has radicalised Conservative members so much that they would rather break up the United Kingdom than not leave the EU. Depressingly the no-deal option is openly flirted with by both leadership candidates, shamelessly proffered to Tory members in exchange for their votes.It is important to remember that even with the DUP’s support, a few Tory rebels can bring down a wayward government by leaving it. What also seems clear is that the new Conservative leader will not have a majority for either his central policy or for his government. That means Theresa May will in all probability have to assess which party leader will command a majority in the Commons. If it is not the Tory leader then it will be Jeremy Corbyn. If neither can put together the votes then Britain will be heading for a general election. Where Tory rebels would go from there is a tantalising question. Some have argued that the shape of the civil war in the party resembles the infighting that was a prelude to Robert Peel’s 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws, which protected British grain against cheaper imports. Peelites such as William Gladstone, who split the Tories by defecting to what ended up as the Liberal party, could justifiably claim to be on the side of the future rather than the past. That is still a seductive argument that could be used by their would-be heirs today.However, the recent experience of Change UK has shown that while there are many contenders for the inheritor of Gladstone’s mantle, their claims have yet to be realised in substance. Well-established mainstream parties are not given to significant splits in the modern era – not least because no substantial breakaway has given rise to a significant new competitor or one that could ally with an existing rival. Both Labour, which endured a traumatic schism in the 1980s, and the Tories are being stretched by Brexit. For the Conservatives there is a more existential threat because it faces a surgent rightwing nationalist Brexit party of Nigel Farage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42860b91979d9217a3d8e3194cfd3fa3c2538274/0_274_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24bcf5f5120748f592282fda87106dbf","title":"brexit union conservative party northern ireland scotland","story":"For three years now, millions of people across Europe have observed the playing out of a peculiarly English psychodrama: it is one that evokes the spirit of the blitz and a world war few are old enough to remember it rehearses idealised images of a return to a golden age of imperial influence and prestige, all as the Conservative party tears itself apart in its attempts to perform Brexit.Within Britain, any references to “national character” remain spectacularly English. The Conservatives have done little to thrash out an image of how the UK can expect to define its post-EU identity – other than vague invocations of sunlit uplands – because they cannot yet fathom how to properly exit. But most politicians and members of the public who are heavily invested in Brexit tend to speak of English exceptionalism as the trait that will pull them through.It is notable, though, that Tory politicians have been frequently careful to refer to their group by its full name: the Conservative and Unionist party. That they do so is a kind of over-compensation, because it is increasingly obvious to anyone watching this slow-motion car crash that, for all the talk of taking back power from Brussels, the project is all about moving it to London, rather than incorporating Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast. Attention has been paid to the problems involving the Irish backstop, but the focus has been on trade and goods, rather than the rights of iniduals to move across the border freely, and how border infrastructure could revive the tensions and demons of the past. The prospect of independence in Scotland has largely been dismissed by politicians in England, even while the arguments there rage on, inflamed by the looming exit deal and the even more extreme possibility of no deal. Polling on feeling across the union is conducted regularly, but views haven’t been quite so in sync for some time. Sentiment around independence in Wales particularly, but also Scotland, ebbs and flows. But a poll for the Sunday Times over the weekend showed that support for Scottish and Welsh independence had risen – granted, with a large number of undecided voters – and that if Boris Johnson became Tory leader, both countries would shift firmly towards independence if given the chance to vote. Nationalists in Ireland have seen support for Irish reunification rise, though the large proportion of undecided voters, who may pull back from the brink, remains a real threat to that cause. Repeated polling in Ireland suggests politicians should consider planning for a border poll – a referendum on Irish reunification – since sentiment is riding so high, even before Brexit.Will the Conservative members preparing to vote for Johnson even care if Brexit ends up leading to the dissolution of the union? Last week’s YouGov survey of Tory members revealed just how far the card-carrying zealots will go, revealing the majority were happy to see Scotland and Northern Ireland leave the union as long as Brexit was delivered. The majority of members are English, and when patriotism is discussed in the British media, it is English nationalism that is discussed, even when people claim to be discussing a “British” identity. The cultural uniqueness of Scotland or Wales is a matter of indifference. The Conservatives are happy to see almost anything happen to secure any form of Brexit whatsoever.When Brexit happens, the pressures leading towards a political breakup of the United Kingdom will become intense. Why wouldn’t every other country abandon England? If the backstop continues to threaten trade and people in Northern Ireland don’t feel listened to, what is to be gained by being tethered to Westminster?The argument against Welsh independence has always been economic, and the Scottish independence referendum was plagued by fears over currency reform, banking and the economics of natural resources, leading to the narrow no vote. But if the poorest areas of the UK can expect to suffer further economic hardship as a result of Brexit, after already being ravaged by the architects of austerity, why not – to steal a phrase – “take back control” and at least steer your local economy in a decentralised direction that acknowledges the geographic challenges?Ultimately, the Conservatives don’t care enough to recognise the risks. But right now the breakup of the union looks extraordinarily likely, if not inevitable. It means if Johnson does indeed become the next UK prime minister, he may also be its last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30f8d9468c50022feb393cfc0aa296da6bc3d6a/0_91_4324_2594/master/4324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c63759f9b17a84f05a58ed125349b7ea","title":"britain remain brexit tory party","story":"The frontrunner’s domestic squall on Thursday night has acted as a lightning-flash illumination of the democratic fraud unfolding before our eyes. Had this tiff happened on Love Island, at least every citizen would get to vote. If a despairing lethargy hung over the prime ministerial contest, this fracas has electrified the preposterous nature of the non-choice, and our total exclusion from it. Pinch yourself: is this really be happening in a democracy? This is now a remainer nation, held hostage by extreme no-dealers.Remember, this has never happened before. It was bad enough when MPs chose the sitting prime minister – John Major, Theresa May, Gordon Brown – but for the first time the Tory party’s misbegotten 1998 rules see our fate fixed by the votes of a tiny self-selecting oligarchy. This novel experiment in non-democracy couldn’t come at a worse time, with the ruling party seized by no-deal Brexit mania, forcing all candidates to abandon truth to woo the membership’s worst delusions. Only one, Sam Gyimah, represented anything approaching the British remain majority, but he couldn’t scrape eight nominations to get into the contest: that’s the nature of the Tory beast.Look at the “choice”, between two hard-Brexiters ready to drag the county into the no-deal abyss. The Sutton Trust and Social Mobility Commission’s report lands today with perfect timing, showing that private schooling and Oxbridge still govern every British commanding height. How apt, with a “choice” between an Etonian ex-president of the Oxford Union or an admiral’s son, head boy of Charterhouse and president of the Oxford University Conservative Association.They are not Britain, these members who booed Iain Dale for asking Johnson to explain the shouting from his partner’s flat, loud enough to be heard from the street with her yelling “Get off me!” and “Get out of my flat!” Women want to know. And though the old, male Tory members may think it’s irrelevant, they may note that Johnson’s lead with real voters fell eight points in a day.Yet the UK is in mortal danger of being dragged into a no-deal Brexit against its will, with no vote, no say. Where is the rebellion against this democratic outrage? Instead we get dishonesty about obeying a long-defunct “will of the people” plus Hunt’s surprisingly frank confession on the Radio 4 Today programme that there will be no election as it would put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. A referendum is resisted for the same reasons: Brexit would lose.Labour’s shadow cabinet today debates its miserable non-position again, as the admirable Another Europe is Possible campaign has already galvanised 300 local associations to send motions to conference demanding a switch to a “remain, reform, revolt” referendum stance. Corbyn was consulting trade unions yesterday: YouGov shows trade unionists overwhelmingly back a remain referendum. (Except Labour’s biggest donor, Len McCluskey of Unite.)Labour’s failure to take the strong remain stand that growing numbers of its shadow cabinet, and most members, support leaves an empty chair where Labour should be. How profoundly depressing that Corbyn-backing Momentum has proposed 10 conference motions but not a single one refers to Brexit. Nicky Morgan’s “alternative arrangement” yesterday was an imaginary side-deal between the UK and Ireland to let food travel freely across the border: it too was instantly exposed as balderdash by trade experts. Both Hunt and Johnson boast of magic EU negotiating tactics and wizard border wheezes neither has yet been stripped naked of such nonsense by relentless grilling. Now Theresa May says the next prime minister can avoid scrutiny by the Commons until September.Labour should be ready for an election soon, as both Tory remain rebels and StandUp4Brexit MPs from the European Research Group pledge to pull down a Johnson government if he deviates either way. Nigel Farage yesterday proposed a pact with the Tories that would deliver a devastating hard Brexit crash-out. This could see the remain majority crushed by a minority ToryFarage Brexit machine. The only salvation would be the remain parties knocking all heads together to fight as an anti-Brexit alliance.

But, 15 years later, he’s part of a movement intent on taking it to EuropePlaying tape-ball in Lahore, joining a game in a Leyton car park, coaching at Lord’s – it’s not a bad trajectory.Adnan Choudhry, one of the UK’s strongest proponents of a relatively unknown version of cricket called tape-ball, refers to his sporting journey as a “remarkable thing”.Although relatively few fans in England are aware of tape-ball, the sport – a version of street cricket developed in Pakistan – is growing considerably, both in its country of origin and farther afield.The name comes from the use of electrical tape to cover a tennis ball this ensures players have the opportunity to experience all aspects of hard-ball cricket – just with less outlay and less risk.Costly pads, helmets and gloves are not required, as the ball poses less of a threat than the traditional, leather-bound wooden ball. “Cricket is an expensive sport to play, but tape-ball makes it much easier,” says Choudhry. “You just need a bat, ball and tape.“You can play in a car park, a normal park, any place where you can run around a little. You don’t need gear or even 11 players – just a few friends. But you use the same type of skills that are used in hard ball cricket.”As a young child growing up in Pakistan, Choudhry was first introduced to tape-ball by his uncle, who played for his work team. Fascinated by what he was watching, the 10-year-old began playing with his uncle on the dusty neighbourhood streets.At the time, it was a sport played mainly for fun, but over the past decade it has grown in popularity, and sponsorship has made tape-ball cricket a fully professional sport in Pakistan.“I played mostly with my friends when I was younger,” Choudhry says. “It was popular then, but now it’s grown all over south Asia and is expanding beyond the continent.“Players who are good enough are now able to play it professionally and choose it as a career. There are lots of tournaments and events, the players get paid, and there are coaches specifically for tape-ball.”When Choudhry arrived in England in 2004, at the age of 19, to study business at college, it was the first time he had ventured away from his family and his country.He knew there would be plenty of competitive hard-ball cricket played in his adopted home, but imagined tape-ball hadn’t been exported to the UK.But a friend from Lahore knew where there was a tape-ball game being played in a car park in Leyton, London – and it was this that helped Choudhry find his feet. “Playing cricket – tape-ball in particular – is how I made friends and connections. It opened up new doors for me,” he says.That first game in the car park quickly became a regular event, with spectators becoming players. “We created a team, and through tape-ball we were able to connect with some local clubs,” he says.Ace Avengers Lions – the club Choudhry helped form in 2016 that also plays T20 and T10 cricket – has grown in the past four years from just two friends to more than 100 members.Its creation was partly driven by the knowledge that children in his local Walthamstow area were unaware of pathways to playing cricket, or being able to easily find a club to join.Choudhry also works as a cricket coach and engagement officer for Capital Kids Cricket, an organisation that delivers cricket-related projects in London, as well as coaching on the Chance to Shine Street programme. Both organisations focus on providing disadvantaged people with the opportunity to participate in healthy, physical, activity.Once Waltham Forest council became aware of the work Choudhry was doing, it was keen to get behind the initiative and provide added resources and support.“This area is quite deprived, and a few years ago the kids here did not have easy access to sports. We are trying to bring tape-ball to a school level and introduce it to kids at a young age,” says Choudhry.It’s an aim shared by NatWest, who have spent almost 40 years championing cricket as a sport for all by partnering with organisations such as Chance to Shine. The national children’s charity engages young people in communities across the country, and uses cricket to create positive opportunities and show the sport is available to everyone.This year, Choudhry helped host a tape-ball event for the local community that was sponsored by Essex Cricket and Leyton Orient FC – with the football club hosting at their ground.Local primary and secondary school pupils participated, and 50 visually impaired students from nearby Joseph Clarke school also played an adapted version of the game.Later in the day came the main event, The Tornado Tape Ball World Cup – an eight-team tournament in which Choudhry’s Ace Avengers were victorious.It was a day filled with pride for Choudhry, who now has ambitions beyond the UK for tape-ball. “In the future, there are tape-ball teams from Germany, France and Belgium that we are hoping to bring over here to play, or we can travel to play them.”Playing and coaching cricket has enabled Choudhry to play at some of the sport’s most iconic grounds – the sort of thing most lovers of the game dream of – and he understands how fortunate he has been.“Now I do coaching sessions at Lord’s, and I’ve played at the Oval too. It’s a big leap from that car park. I can’t quite put it into words how amazing that journey has been.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Now she’s back home with her own web series, Sarah’s ChannelJust a minute into its first episode, the ABC’s comedy web series Sarah’s Channel makes two things clear: first, that it’s intimately familiar with the rhythms and affectations of makeup fans who’ve carved a career out of sharing videos on YouTube and second, that something very dark and catastrophic occurred before the peppy and resilient Sarah – played by Sydney-born comedian Claudia O’Doherty – began broadcasting on her webcam.Created by Nick Coyle, with whom O’Doherty began performing as a student in university sketch group Pig Island, the series follows Sarah as she perseveres with her makeup tutorial, product haul and daily routine – despite being forced to forage for supplies “on the surface”.She is surrounded by a grim troupe of post-apocalyptic, evolutionarily stunted humans who view her as a saviour figure, mimicking “like and subscribe!” – the catchcry of influencers everywhere – to earn her affection.O’Doherty is intimately familiar with the mannerisms of the beauty vlogger, having procrastinated often in the depths of the YouTube algorithm. She describes what she finds there as “such a good combination of boring and compelling at the same time”.Since moving to Los Angeles for a role on the Judd Apatow-produced Netflix series Love, O’Doherty has become known for coupling a sweet grin and chirpy punchline with performances that can touch on sad and dark human truths. Her character on Love, Bertie, mirrored her experience as an Australian expat adjusting to a new country – although O’Doherty’s transition was much smoother than that.“I moved to America when I got the part on Love, and so I had a very cushy situation where I was instantly introduced to people because of the job,” she says. “Looking for a job in Los Angeles seems like the scariest thing to do in the world.”Her journey reads, on paper, like a dream scenario for any hopeful comic, as hard work collided with chance encounters to forge a career she couldn’t have ever predicted. After garnering a cult comedy following with Pig Island, she created a solo show for the Melbourne Fringe festival, which led to stints overseas in Edinburgh. She moved to London in 2012, where she had a small community and a presence in the UK’s alternative comedy scene. Then, as she tells it, “Channel 4 over there gave me a web series.”That series, in which a dry and curious O’Doherty attempts to answer the question “What is England?” drew the attention of Amy Schumer. “That was the thing that started my career because people could watch it in America,” O’Doherty explains. “Amy Schumer saw it and gave me a part in her movie.”That film, 2015’s comedy sensation Trainwreck, was directed by Judd Apatow, who asked her on the last day of shooting if she wanted to develop a character for a new series, which he was co-creating with writer Lesley Arfin and comic Paul Rust. “I said yes, but I didn’t think it was true. I went back to my house in London, which was a sharehouse full of mice. When it did happen, I couldn’t believe it. I was in a good mood for three years.”Thanks also to appearances on shows like Comedy Bang Bang!, the Kroll Show and Conan, a global audience began to take notice. “There was no part of me that was like, ‘This is what I deserve and this is my time to shine!’” she laughs. “It was very much like, ‘Oh this doesn’t seem real.’”But choosing comedy in Australia isn’t an easy task, particularly for a woman. Before creating her first Fringe show, she recognised one of the few places for a solo performer was standup. That scene was less than appealing. “It just seemed to be 35-year-old men wearing leather jackets who were angry. I was like, ‘I’m not angry, and I don’t want to hang out with those people.’Coming back to Sydney to make Sarah’s Channel, the comedy world is a little more welcoming.“Having a little bit of a profile from doing something in America has made it easier to get this made,” she says. “I do wonder if I’d stayed in Australia if we would be able to make this show with me in it.”• Sarah’s Channel is now streaming on iView"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3942b30d94f42ecfc812a322f61093e071881fa8/0_374_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf20255e6f4b6bcfa441debd209a57a5","title":"judi dench defends work of kevin spacey and harvey weinstein","story":"Actor condemns alleged behaviour but says stars’ work should not be forgottenDame Judi Dench has spoken out about her sadness at seeing her friends Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey shunned from the big screen.Despite condemning their behaviour publicly, Dench told the Radio Times she was concerned the pair’s work would be forgotten.Dench does not defend Spacey and Weinstein against allegations over their misconduct but rued the treatment of Spacey in particular, whose performances were removed from Ridley Scott’s 2017 film All the Money in the World after it was completed.“What kind of agony is that?” she said.Dench credits Weinstein with much of her success. The former House of Cards actor Kevin Spacey supported her following the death of her husband, Michael Williams, in 2001.In 2018, it was alleged that Spacey invited the actor Anthony Rapp to a party at his home in 1986, when Spacey was 26 and Rapp was 14. Rapp alleged that Spacey lifted him on to his bed and tried to climb on top of him.Spacey responded to the allegations at the time saying he did not remember the incident, but apologising for it nonetheless.In an online statement, he said: “I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”Spacey has since faced other allegations about sexual misconduct. Following the claims, a special Emmy award that was due to be given to Spacey was revoked. The Old Vic, where Spacey was artistic director between 2004 and 2015, expressed its dismay at the allegations against him.Dench was one of the first celebrities to publicly denounce Weinstein after claims against him, saying she was “horrified” by his alleged behaviour.Weinstein was removed from the board of his company and stripped of many accolades after dozens of women came forward to allege that they were sexually assaulted or raped by him.He was indicted on charges of rape and a criminal sexual act in 2018 but pleads not guilty to the claims against him, and has denied any non-consensual sex.In a wide-ranging interview, Dench also spoke to the Radio Times about losing her eyesight and having to stop driving.“I can’t read the paper now, I can’t do the crossword, I can’t read a book,” she says, “but, you know, you cope. I’ve got people who read to me and coach me with my lines,” she said.She dismissed the discomfort, putting it down to being part of her job: “On a film set you learn where everything is. It’s OK if you can get away with it. It’s all acting, after all. Fooling people. It’s what I do.”But she described the realisation that she would have to stop driving as traumatising.“It was absolutely appalling,” she said. “But I just know I’ll kill somebody if I get behind the wheel of a car now.”Dench does not know what will happen to her eyesight but said she feels more comfortable not knowing the prognosis.“I don’t want to know,” she said. “There’s nothing you can do. You adapt to it. So I ignore it altogether.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f1a0139c4acae8fbaa0c00279c1ce7b370a727/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cebc09472be637110780c868e925a52","title":"kx marks the spot how kings cross became londons newest creative neighbourhood","story":"With the arrival of shopping and dining district Coal Drops Yard, King’s Cross has cemented its place as one of London’s most exciting destinations – for work and playMove over Shoreditch, make way Marylebone high street, fashion and design has found a new home in the capital: King’s Cross. Formerly known as the badlands of the city, the area has now transformed into a lively neighbourhood.Following the , who moved into the music and art hub Kings Place in 2008, the legendary fashion and design school Central Saint Martins, which counts Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney among its alumni, took up residence in neighbouring Granary Square in 2011. More recently, big cultural players including Google, the House of Illustration, Universal Music, the Knowledge Quarter and Time Out have also arrived – bringing with them more people, ideas and creativity.But King’s Cross is far from “all work”. Making use of the Victorian brick viaducts that once held London’s coal store, the bright and airy 20,000 sq ft Coal Drops Yard has taken on a new life as a shopping and dining nirvana. The impossibly stylish redesign – undertaken by the award-winning King’s Cross-based architect, Thomas Heatherwick – is topped off with an already iconic “kissing roof”, which will soon be home to Samsung’s new flagship store.And hang out they do. King’s Cross, which is home to one of the capital’s main railway arteries and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras, has always been busy with people passing through but, now, it’s a destination in its own right.Already home to an enviable collection of foodie hotspots and cultural highlights – from the KERB food market that sets up for lunch service in Granary Square three days a week, to the nearby British Library and Wellcome Collection, both just a short walk away – when Coal Drops Yard arrived in October 2018, it was seen by many as the icing on the cake. Home to more than 50 stores and restaurants, many of which are young, independent businesses, every archway is filled with thought-provoking products and tantalising flavours.When it comes to fashion, Coal Drops Yard is definitely adding to the conversation, with a unique and eclectic range of brands and boutiques from a three-storey Cos store (which doubles a space to celebrate the art and design that inspires their clothes) and stylish Fred Perry outlet, to independent boutiques such as S120 and Form\u0026ampThread, and menswear heavy-hitters, Universal Works, to name but a few.“We’ve always envisioned King’s Cross as a microcosm of the city – it’s a erse community where people live, work, study and socialise,” explains Anna Strongman, partner at Argent. “In Coal Drops Yard, we’ve aimed to create a unique destination that connects all types of visitors through our combination of shops, restaurants and a vibrant year-round cultural events programme.”With so much change taking place in such a short space of time, it’s fair to say the area’s blossoming into a creative neighbourhood has taken some people by surprise. “When I first moved to London almost seven years ago, I wouldn’t have imagined King’s Cross would be considered a ‘fashion hub,’” says Central Saint Martins alumni and 10 Magazine’s fashion and features assistant, Helena Fletcher.Not everyone is as shocked by the area’s metamorphosis, though. “Generally, when creative industries move into a space in any city, that space then becomes desirable over time,” explains Adam Murray, fashion lecturer at Central Saint Martins.For Henry Graham, creative director and co-founder of Wolf \u0026amp Badger, which has a three-storey concept store in the main yard, Coal Drops Yard is a destination that really stands out from the competition. “In what is an increasingly homogeneous retail landscape, the King’s Cross Central Limited Partnership should be applauded for their courage in proactively seeking out innovative and unique fashion and lifestyle retailers, all of whom, through their stores in Coal Drops Yard, bring a new experience not only to the immediate area but London as a whole,” he says.To discover more about Coal Drop Yard’s unique stores, restaurants and packed diary of cultural events, head to coaldropsyard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32733ef6f64405eb0f637a39a47630da1660ac89/0_290_5215_3129/master/5215.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce96d62a2bc07d76ce1f8f210ed538a","title":"correct jeremy hunt nonsense about children reading michael rosen","story":"It was interesting to see in last week’s Tory leadership voting that both you and your schools minister Nick Gibb had backed Michael Gove to be prime minister.On TV and radio Gove seemed very proud of his record as education secretary.

I thought there was “rigour” missing in how Gove was treated during his interviews: I didn’t hear anyone ask him why he was sacked as education secretary (it was because he was considered a “toxic liability”). Perhaps I can help. In the early stages of bringing in systematic, synthetic phonics for teaching children to read, people in charge were scrupulous in separating the ideas of “decoding” and “reading”. Phonics, they said, taught children how to “decode” writing: that is, to learn the “alphabetic principle”, while “reading” was used to describe reading for meaning.Nigh on every child can “decode” by age five or six, yet when the same children are 10 or 11, some of the decoders don’t understand what they’re reading.

They also learned to take responsibility for looking after them.”Classrooms across the UK house a wide range of school pets: hamsters, fish, guinea pigs and even tortoises. But though they teach children about nature it is not always a happy story, animal charities say, and it might be teaching children the wrong lessons.In some schools, animals are left alone for long periods, over-handled and farmed out to different homes at weekends. Some die because the school cannot afford vets’ fees, the charities say. They are calling on schools to find other ways of teaching about nature and taking responsibility, perhaps by creating their own wildlife areas instead.The eggs at Derby High came from a company that provided detailed instructions on how to care for the ducklings and took them back to rear, but the service costs money not all schools can afford.Classrooms can be noisy and frightening places for some animals, the RSPCA and the charity Peta (People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals) say. Peta says it hears complaints that animals have died after being forgotten during school holidays, or through accidents in pupils’ homes. “Many teachers who keep classroom pets do so with good intentions. But a classroom simply isn’t a suitable home for an animal, and there are many factors that kind teachers need to consider before bringing one into theirs,” says Elisa Allen, the charity’s director.“The sleep-wake cycles of nocturnal animals, such as mice and hamsters, are disrupted by bright classroom lights and by pupils who disturb sleeping animals by taking them out of their cages and handling them,” she says.The Potteries Guinea Pig Rescue, based in Stoke-on-Trent, has taken in a number of guinea pigs from schools in North Staffordshire that have found themselves unable to care for the animals.“We have taken in many pairs of guinea pigs from schools that were originally classroom pets,” says Helen Chadwick, its founder and rescue manager. “The school thought it was a good idea until the animal experienced health issues and they had to pay for vet treatment. Any pet in school sets an example that caring for animals is part-time. To promote responsible pet ownership we want to see all pets treated as part of the family unit, with their needs catered for 24 hours a day.“It’s vital in an age still so contaminated with animal neglect and cruelty that our generation set an example to children,” she says. “I can’t imagine many things worse than being limited to a cage stuck in a noisy classroom all day.” At Derby High, Holmes says it’s important for children to learn how to care for animals. “Actually seeing the ducklings hatch brings nature to life and makes the topic much more meaningful and purposeful. They absolutely loved having them in class and would check on them regularly making sure they had plenty of food and water.”However, Debs Howe, a former biology teacher who runs Eggucation, an ethical egg hatching company, says that, done responsibly, looking after animals can be an experience children don’t forget. “It inspires them to learn more about the natural world. For children who may have issues accessing the curriculum, often due to autism or emotional or behavioural issues, the hatching of chicks has an incredible effect.“It’s also a fantastic way for children from inner-city schools, who may never have seen farm animals or the countryside, to experience animals and nature and learn how to care for them.”Despite concerns, many schools continue to use animals to teach children about nature and as therapy. The guinea pig Snowball even won praise from Ofsted inspectors at Upton primary, near Halifax, West Yorkshire. Their report said: “Opportunities to look after Snowball, the school pet, inspire pupils to consider their actions and help them understand the importance of being calm and caring.”However, the RSPCA says: “We would discourage educational establishments from attempting to keep and look after animals themselves. We believe that children can be taught about animals without keeping pets in the classroom. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for pets intended to live at a school to require rehoming.”Some schools have solved the problem by using dogs belonging to staff members, parents or friends of the school. Kings Hill primary, in West Malling, Kent, for example, has two dogs – Charlie a therapy dog and Duke, a reading dog.“Children who struggle find it easier to read to Duke, our American cocker iel, because he doesn’t correct them and they then start to enjoy the story and are reading for pleasure,” says Georgette Williams, the head of inclusion. “It is our most successful intervention.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9d2fd9a92931351f08c529db5ed88154495bbc/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=316ace8d5b227cccef13791770c6e88d","title":"how we made candyman virginia madsen tony todd bee sting","story":"The director and star of the horror classic remember acting with swarming insects – and using hypnosis to get a deeper performance from Virginia MadsenHorror was considered a debased genre in the early 90s and people were looking for a new direction. I found a story in Clive Barker’s Books of Blood collection that I thought had potential: The Forbidden, about a middle-class women fascinated by a Merseyside housing estate. I knew Clive a little, so he gave me a free option. After the nightmare he had had on Hellraiser, where it was redubbed into American English, I decided to set the film in the US.They wouldn’t let us go there at first without a police escort. The social ide was really extreme compared to anything in a Liverpool housing estate. But despite its reputation, most people there were just getting on with their lives. The fear people had of walking around there was the very essence of racism – it is ultimately based on the fear of the other, or the unknown.We only shot for a week in Cabrini-Green, to do the wide shots and the exteriors. The rest was done on a set in Los Angeles. I tried to listen to the black actors and not fall into the Hollywood trap of imposing racial stereotypes and to make people rounded characters, not ciphers or caricatures. Kasi Lemmons, who plays the lead character Helen’s friend – and later directed Eve’s Bayou – was very helpful with details.I was watching Johnny Carson’s show when it featured a professor of entomology, Norman Gary, who had an act where he would play the clarinet covered in bees. He had synthesised queen-bee pheromone and would cover himself in it so they wouldn’t sting. Immediately, I knew this was how we would do the scenes where the bees engulf Candyman and Helen. We worked on those scenes for days. It was difficult and stressful. Gary was breeding immature bees in hives on the studio roof – they don’t have any venom, so we tried to use those. After every shot, he would vacuum them up into a little soft pouch and take them back to their dressing room. All Tony had was a dental dam to prevent them going down his throat. He was very courageous – it’s such an unsettling and stunning image when the bees emerge from his mouth.I’m also a blues musician, and all blues artists can trace their pain to the slavery fields of the Mississippi Delta. Anyone who’s a fan of jazz and blues can hear that howl. I consider this film a direct descendant of that. Bernard and I hung out in Chicago for a few days while he did location work. I wasn’t worried about him being a white English guy, we were like lost siblings who had found each other. I trusted his intellectualism and my own instincts. I knew I wasn’t going to create a caricature and that I wanted to root the character deep in the history of slavery in America.I negotiated a bonus of $1,000 for every sting during the bee scene. And I got stung 23 times. Everything that’s worth making has to involve some sort of pain. Once I realised it was an important part of who Candyman was, I embraced it. It was like putting on a beautiful coat.I’ve done 200 movies, this is the one that stays in people’s minds. It affects people of all races. I’ve used it as an introductory tool in gang-intervention work: what frightens you? What horrible things have you experienced? Let’s see what Jordan Peele produces with his sequel.

Three times Aidy Boothroyd’s side led Croatia. Three times they squandered the initiative. They have been consistent in Italy and San Marino but being winless and error-ridden was not what England set out to achieve.Inexplicable lapses in concentration were features of defeats to both France and Romania. They resurfaced here as defending that left the head coach struggling for answers enabled Croatia to cancel out goals from Reiss Nelson, James Maddison and Jonjoe Kenny. This has been a steep learning curve for players with designs on full England honours in the near future. In 10 unbeaten qualifiers England conceded four goals. In the heat of three tournament group games they have conceded nine. Switching off has been a pattern of their play throughout.“It’s the story of the tournament for us really – wonderful attacking play but basic, fundamental defensive errors with poor passes and decisions,” said Boothroyd. “At least we are getting one part of the game right but, with this team, conceding goals has undone us.“There is obviously a concentration issue but it’s been different players who have been doing it, not just one guy over and over again. When we go through it all there will be plenty to learn. The main thing is that you stay in the game mentally, you score a goal and instead of relaxing you need to treble your efforts. That is all over the pitch. When you look at the calibre of players who are making the mistakes it doesn’t make sense. There will be reasons and we will get to the bottom of them with a new team next time around.”Nelson, Tammy Abraham and Lloyd Kelly were handed first starts and each impressed initially. The Arsenal forward Nelson posed a constant threat from the right and his quick feet won an early penalty when he was clipped inside the area by Branimir Kalaica following a slick passing move involving Kieran Dowell and the recalled Phil Foden. Abraham was England’s designated penalty taker but Nelson took it, and scored confidently, without consulting Boothroyd. “They’d not told me,” he said. “I haven’t got to the bottom of it yet.”Abraham struck a post with an impudent flick from Maddison’s pass but, just as England were in control, their defensive problems appeared. Josip Brekalo was afforded far too much space on the left and accepted the invitation to attack Kenny. The Wolfsburg midfielder feigned to go outside the new Schalke loan signing only to cut inside and drive a fine finish into the far, top corner of Dean Henderson’s goal.Nelson was heavily involved again when England retook the lead. The 19-year-old breezed beyond Marijan Cabraja on the right before floating an inviting cross to the back post. Filip Uremovic should have cleared but, under no pressure, directed a tame header straight at Maddison’s feet. He had time to pick his spot and found the roof of the net from 12 yards out.Once again, however, England gifted their opponents a way back. Kelly seemed to have cleared the danger after Foden had been dispossessed in central midfield, showing good pace to beat Lovro Majer to the through ball that followed. But Bournemouth’s recent recruit undid his good work with a careless pass back to Majer. He found Sandro Kulenovic, the powerful striker laid the ball off to Nikola Vlasic and the former Everton midfielder curled a delightful finish into the bottom corner. Cska Moscow’s new £14m signing was caught by Ezri Konsa and had to be carried off on a stretcher.Kenny thought he had given England victory with a thunderous 25-yard drive when Maddison’s corner was headed into his path. But they blew it a third time when Henderson’s clearance was returned with interest by Croatia and, with the right-back caught upfield and Fikayo Tomori too deep, Luka Ivanusec released Brekalo to score his second of the game. A deflating end to a tournament to forget for England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc5bb80c9d0d3d1ed734ac53bddbcbb1ec2d826/0_172_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3abb5ec06bfaa797edb61a11100ab33b","title":"rafael benitez control freaks newcastle united mike ashley","story":"Last season was drawing to a close when Rafael Benítez stood in a quiet corridor at St James’ Park briefing a small group of newspaper journalists on his seemingly interminable negotiations over a new contract with Mike Ashley.Little of substance was said but, as the conversation drew to a close, something unusual happened. Instead of the customary thumbs up or little wave as Benítez turned on his heel and wandered off there were firm handshakes and, for this reporter, a kiss from Newcastle United’s manager.It could have been something or nothing but, at the time it rang slight alarm bells. Was Newcastle’s best manager since Sir Bobby Robson saying “goodbye?” Had the erosion of trust in his relationship with the club’s owner dictated that Benítez would not be returning to the city he had fallen at least half in love with and the club he once dreamed of leading back into Europe?Discussions with Ashley dragged on and talk – yet again – of a potential Emirati takeover promised, tantalisingly, to change the narrative but, on Monday the fears raised in that corridor were realised.Some of those who know the Spaniard well are convinced he has had at least one foot in the departure lounge for a good couple of months now and few could blame him. At 59, Benítez feels he has another decade left in management. As a serial winner of trophies who thrives on big European nights, part of him knew his talents were in serious danger of being wasted on Tyneside.The frustration is that so much was perfect the 52,000 full houses, the almost unconditional love from fans who repeatedly chanted “Rafa Benítez we want you to stay,” the citadel-like stadium situated right in the city centre.As a city Newcastle shares many similarities with Liverpool and it was no surprise it seemed like a natural habitat for a man who enjoyed one of the happiest, and most successful, periods of his career on Merseyside, where his family home remains.Indeed, Benítez had long had a soft spot for what would become his adopted home on Gallowgate. During an interlude as Chelsea manager, he stood in that aforementioned St James’ corridor following a defeat inflicted by Alan Pardew’s then side and, as he debriefed reporters, there was a definite sense that he rather envied Pardew’s job.So much so that when Ashley sacked Steve McClaren, Benítez swiftly made it clear he was available – it was not long after his departure from Real Madrid – and rather fancied stepping in. Initially he joined on a nine-game contract but when, through no fault of his own, Newcastle were relegated that season, he shocked a lot of people by agreeing to drop down into the Championship with them.Promotion swiftly followed – but the celebrations had barely subsided before things started to go wrong. Benítez and Ashley are both, to differing degrees and in contrasting ways, control freaks, both men are enigmatic and their partnership was never going to be straightforward.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsPerhaps fearing that Benítez’s political manoeuvres might push him into unwelcome corners, Ashley managed things by very rarely speaking to, and almost never meeting, his manager. This dysfunctional union was held together by Lee Charnley, the club’s managing director, who frequently struggled to satisfy two such invariably incompatible masters.Money is Ashley’s main motivator and possibly he struggled to understand why Benítez’s £6m-a-year contract was not enough. But the manager did not like the retail tycoon’s policy of signing players only aged 25 and under so that they possessed decent resale value. He wanted to leaven youth with experience, to revamp Newcastle’s academy and radically overhaul a training ground which, compared with those of some Premier League counterparts, was more functional-yet-tired mid-range hotel than modernist six-star spa resort.And then there was the budget: the owner envisaged spending around £50m on transfers this summer, his head coach would have preferred at least double that amount. But it was more than merely about pure figures Benítez became increasingly disturbed by how long it took Ashley to execute any potential deal, how everything had to go through not just Charnley but the owner’s fixer, the lawyer Justin Barnes.The striker Salomón Rondón became a bit of a cause célèbre for Benítez’s philosophy. The West Brom forward who joined on loan was much too close to 30 for Ashley’s liking but his goals and all-round excellence at centre-forward played a big part in preserving Newcastle’s Premier League status for a second season running and the manager believed it was imperative he should be signed on an expensive, permanent deal.Ashley, though, could not seem to understand why the former Champions League-winning coach was so hooked up on the player and his reluctance to spend the money on the Venezuelan quite possibly kiboshed any hopes of a contract extension.If part of Benítez always knew he was leaving this summer, maybe another part hoped Ashley would finally blink first. When, a couple of weeks ago, his camp started briefing that Chelsea might, slightly startlingly, want him back it appeared part of a classic game to push Ashley into accepting his demands.The news that he could command a £12m-a-year salary in China looked a similar ploy but the resultant headlines failed to produce the desired breakthrough and Newcastle are left seeking a new manager able to reprise Benítez’s feat in somehow avoiding relegation by coaxing one of the Premier League’s weakest squads into significant overachievement.That newcomer can expect to meet closed hearts and minds on Tyneside. The emotional barriers threaten to be formidable whoever they are and however good they may be, they will not be Rafa Benítez.Maybe one day Ashley will reflect on precisely how he let the best manager he ever had slip through his fingers. First, though, he will need to understand why Benítez spent more than three years trying, forlornly, to tell him that it really is pointless knowing the price of everything if you don’t appreciate the value of anything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a6d963d97fd90d81cd275c48156dc483291a7a8/0_157_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=241a15cf38fbfc0a13d2d6e075839f82","title":"sweden canada womens world cup match report","story":"Stina Blackstenius fired Sweden into the quarter-finals of the Women’s World Cup but they needed a penalty save from Hedvig Lindahl to beat Canada 1-0 in Paris.A slow-burner finally came to life in the second half, with Kosovare Asllani at the heart of it. Asllani raced downfield and played an inch-perfect pass for Blackstenius to score – with the game’s first shot on target just shy of the hour mark.But it was also Asllani who was penalised for handball eight minutes later, before Lindahl denied Janine Beckie from the spot.The crowd had taken to Mexican waves to entertain themselves during a dismal opening half but there were plenty of talking points after the break.Canada were the first to finally have a shot, with Christine Sinclair bending a free-kick wide in the 53rd minute.But Sweden broke the deadlock just before the hour when Asllani charged down the left before sliding the ball across for the on-running Blackstenius to chip it over Stephanie Labbé.That brought Canada to life and they had their chance with a little over 20 minutes to go when Desiree Scott’s shot struck Asllani on the arm from point-blank range.Beckie stepped up and struck her penalty well but not well enough to beat the quick e of Lindahl, who was soon swamped by teammates.Sweden then thought they had a penalty of their own when Ashley Lawrence went through the back of Fridolina Rolfö but VAR determined there was an offside in the buildup.The decision offered Canada some hope, though they rarely looked likely to capitalise as Adriana Leon and Shelina Zadorsky squandered late chances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/356b1c3afb7038d8364fb873457b9c77cc86de8c/0_41_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbe0c9eda306093dbc3585de531ee129","title":"women world cup 2019 cameroon england judge game","story":"Some of the behaviour we saw from Cameroon’s players and their coach in their game against England was shocking, but it is important to make it clear that it was not an indictment of the women’s game. It is an indictment of Cameroon specifically, and it was a game I can only hope their players watch, cringe, are honest about and learn from in the future, to understand the weight of responsibility that comes from representing your nation with pride and professionalism.They had complained about the refereeing of their last game, against New Zealand, and I think they probably came into the England match with that perceived sense of injustice bubbling just below the surface. Their coach did not do a good job of controlling those emotions. The shame is that if they had focused on playing the game they would probably have scored a couple of goals, because England looked very open at the back.Before the game I was singing the praises of the Cameroonian team, ranked 46th in the world by Fifa, who arrived in the last 16 with strong performances in their group, having tested Canada (ranked fifth), scored against the Netherlands (eighth) and beaten New Zealand (19th), thanks to a late strike from Ajara Nchout that is a contender for goal of the tournament. Unfortunately the protests and petulance of the Cameroonian players will be the lasting impression of their nation’s time in France.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsWe see some despicable behaviour in men’s football – ing, horrible fouls, racist abuse, players arguing with opponents, with the referee and sometimes with their own manager – but somehow on those occasions we are able to restrict our judgment to the iniduals involved, rather than the entire sport.Yet some people who saw this game, one wild match in a tournament that has given us moments of greatness and also of disappointment, have announced that it proves women’s football cannot be taken seriously. I think they are watching it the wrong way. It is as if people are not just watching women’s football and enjoying it, they are sitting in judgment. If every time you turn on the TV you need to be persuaded that the women’s game is good enough, it’s probably not for you.Having come through this test, England are now preparing to play a Norway team that are proving themselves among the very best at the World Cup, with an in-form front line and intelligent defence. If England play against Norway as they did against Cameroon they will need a lot of luck to get to the semi-finals.On Sunday night Phil Neville was mostly asked about Cameroon, and he spoke honestly and truthfully. This has been one of his most impressive traits as England manager, and I think we can assume, based on everything we have seen from him so far, that he was as honest with his players when they got back to the team hotel. They need to examine every mistake they made against Cameroon, so they’re ready to show their best against a flourishing Norway team. If England allow Guro Reiten or Isabell Herlovsen on the left-hand side for Norway the kind of space they got against Australia, they will cause a lot of trouble. If they allow or Caroline Hansen the space on the counterattack to run at the back line, they will struggle.I have praised the midfielders Keira Walsh and Jill Scott previously in this tournament. Scott in particular has been in excellent form, and against Cameroon broke Peter Shilton’s record for the most appearances for England in World Cup finals. But in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-1-2-3 formation Walsh is meant to be a defensive midfielder, who sits in and protects the backline, while Scott is a box-to-box player, tucking in defensively and getting forward to break into the opposition penalty area.Against Cameroon both players were too high and left a lot of space in behind them in midfield. One pass and their line was beaten, and it happened a number of times. That is dangerous, because once you beat the midfield line the defence is completely exposed. Against pace, which Norway have got in abundance, this is asking for trouble. A pass to either flank or a through-ball to Herlovsen, and they’re in on goal. The move that led to Nchout scoring, though the goal was disallowed by VAR after the tightest of offside calls, showed how England allowed themselves to be carved open against a Cameroon side that lacked quality in the final third.Lucy Bronze was guilty of overdribbling, carrying the ball into midfield where she was out of position and losing it would cause immediate danger. She is undoubtedly one of the best players in the world, but there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance and sometimes she finds herself on the wrong side of it. Her assist for Ellen White’s goal showed her using her abilities perfectly, exposing the opposition defence before playing a great pass, but sometimes she can be guilty of playing her team into danger, leaving space to exploit on the turnover.White has now scored four goals in France, and is in wonderful form. But Maren Mjelde and Maria Thorisdóttir at the heart of the Norwegian defence were exceptional against Australia and controlled the best forward in the world in Sam Kerr. If England are going to get past that pair White’s movement has to be exceptional, and Fran Kirby will have to help her out with runs from the No 10 role. England will need more than one player to be affecting those two, because the Chelsea pair are smart, experienced defenders who will be familiar with the English forwards.At the same time England’s back four needs to be at the top of their game to deal with Herlovsen, who is in clinical form, Hansen, who must have put in one of the best performances of her life against Australia, and Reiten, a tricky left winger who is about to join Mjelde and Thorisdóttir at Chelsea. When they played Japan in the group stage England were much more tactically disciplined than they were against Cameroon. Japan played a lot of pretty football but didn’t really get anywhere, because England made themselves hard to break down. That is the kind of organisation they will need to show on Thursday.It can be hard, in the middle of a tournament, to turn a poor performance in one game into an excellent one in the next. That is the challenge England face now. The only way to achieve it is to be honest with yourself, to review your mistakes and make sure you don’t repeat them. That is the process Phil Neville and his team have to put themselves through if they are to earn a place in the semi-finals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37d344ff9cf5199107a4515faf230384c3430534/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da423db69b31d36c682f6b3581156fd","title":"america gay bars stonewall at 50 pride lgbtq","story":"Fifty years after Stonewall, and with Trump trying to roll back LGBTQ rights, Dominic Rushe visits three gay bars in different states – and finds them as vibrant and vital as everThe gay bar is in trouble. Fifty years after the Stonewall Inn in New York became the symbol for a new wave of gay activism, the three horsemen of the gay bar apocalypse – gentrification, assimilation and technology – have hollowed out their numbers.Rising rents have shuttered gay bars more straight venues are “accepting” of gay patrons and dating is something people now do with their phones. Even the term “gay bar” looks a little tired as the LGBTQ community finally comes to terms with its many rainbow stripes.But across America – and especially in less progressive states and communities – the gay bar is as vibrant and vital as it has ever been. It’s a rallying point in times of trial and celebration. It is the pumping heart of a community that, as the Trump administration rolls back its rights, needs its own space more than it has in years.You can find Wonderlust, the only gay bar in Jackson, Mississippi, on the northern edge of town, just past the Piggly Wiggly supermarket and the duelling discount stores Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Housed in a long, black, squat building, Wonderlust is marked by panels painted in a sort of rainbow flag. The colours are off – hospital green, shop-soiled peach, sun-bleached eggplant – as if picked from a paint store’s remainder bin.It’s not much to look at, but a bar on this spot has been a haven for Mississippi’s LGBTQ community for more than 25 years.Mississippi is one of the most conservative states in the US. A majority still disagree with same-sex marriage – one of just two states – the other is Alabama – to still hold that view. A few years ago, a Mississippi pastor even brought a horse in a wedding dress to the federal courthouse to protest against gay marriage. State law means businesses can deny service to queer people if doing so would conflict with their “sincerely held” religious beliefs.Gay people here are mostly discreet. Either that or they leave the state. So Wonderlust has become the one public place where they feel safe to be themselves. “There’s a lot of hate in the world,” says Jodi Sullivan, a trans woman and a Wonderlust regular. “It’s either come here or sit at home.”“It’s the Bible belt. Everybody isn’t as accepting of us as other places,” says Drew Gully-Luckett, who, along with his husband John-Corey, is in the process of taking over the bar.Even going out for dinner together in Jackson can have its issues. “If we sit on the same side of the booth, people will look at us funny,” says Gully-Luckett. “We don’t hold hands.”A few years ago, protesters picketed the bar. “It wasn’t a large group,” he says, casually. “Just” 10 to 12 men outside in jacked-up trucks, one with a Confederate flag, “yelling Bible verses and telling us we are going to hell, and if we talk to them we’ll be forgiven”.I tell him that sounds terrifying. He shrugs: “If you just ignore them, there’s nothing they can do.”There are no protests tonight, but as we walk in, a man approaches us asking that we not take his picture or identify him. A prominent sign on the door says the  is filming and interviewing people. He’s a government worker in his 30s. “They don’t know I’m out,” he says.Inside, everyone is out – at least for a good time. Wonderlust is a riot of inclusivity. The crowd is young, old, black, white, Hiic, trans, straight, gay, lesbian, undecided. The music is pumping, there’s a drag show, dancing, laughing, more drinking, pool tables. By 11pm on Saturday, there isn’t a space left on the car park.If there’s a better time to be had for a hundred miles, good luck finding it.But there’s also a layer of sadness draped over this southern charm. Mississippi is stuck in the past. Many of the patrons said they would move if not for financial or family ties.“Being black and gay in the south – it’s rough,” says Michael Johnson, a regular who drives close to an hour to come to Wonderlust. And yet he’s hopeful about the future. “The south has come a long way,” he says. “I see a change. It’s slow, but it’s a change,” he says. “But it’s hard.”He continues: “When I first discovered Wonderlust, it was like a burden was lifted off. It gave me a place to come where I could really let go and be myself. It was a place where I felt comfortable enough to be myself and in this damn time you need that.”The LGBTQ community has achieved major victories in recent years, but Curt Sullivan-Ellis, a tall, handsome bearded man in a checked shirt who is also the drag queen London DuMore, says life has got worse under Trump.Legislators in Mississippi have felt empowered to chip away at hard-won rights, he says, and that message has not been lost on the haters.“I feel sometimes I could be attacked,” he says. “I see a lot more hatred. Especially on Facebook. These feelings, they’ve had them forever but now they can come out and talk about it.”Not here, he says: Wonderlust “gives us a place to be without fear or judgment”.Back in 1986, when Gary Miller and Alan Pierce first started working at the Round-Up Saloon in Dallas, same-sex couples were not allowed to dance together.“If the police came in, everybody would stop dancing and hang out until they left,” Miller remembers. People were afraid to park their cars close to the bar cops would take people’s license plate numbers and turn them in to their employers – which, back in the early days, would mean an automatic termination. How things have changed. At least at Round-Up.Today, the club holds dance classes almost nightly. People from across the state – and the world – come to watch cowboys do the Texas two-step. “Cowboys can be gay too,” says Miller, with a twinkle in his eye.So strong is the pull of the bar that Lady Gaga visits  pretty much every time she’s in town. (“We have a madhouse that night,” says Miller.) Willie Nelson pops in from time to time.And if you’re not fazed by celebrity sightings, the huge country-themed bar has something for everyone. Handsome Stetsoned bar staff sling tequila and beer to a mixed crowd of all ages, ethnicities and orientations to a soundtrack of country and dance music. Patrons pop in to watch Ru Paul’s Drag Race, stay for karaoke, country dancing, a drag show. Big businesses come by the busload to sell Dallas as an inclusive place for their workers. “There was a battle to be fought – and we won,” says Miller.At Round-Up, maybe, but for queer people, Texas is still not easy.“Small-town Texas … there are two religions: football and Jesus. And if you don’t agree with either of those, you are going to hell,” says the drag queen Sable Scities as she beats her face before the night’s performance. Scities grew up in rural Texas and says for many outside of the big cities little has changed.“I snuck up here when I was 17 and snuck into the clubs because this is where you feel accepted. You’re not going to find that at home a lot of times. Maybe Christmas and your birthday.”Texas is still a difficult state for LGBTQ people. Trans women of colour are being murdered, even in Dallas. Gay couples are still being kicked out of bars for dancing together.Coming out here “is never going to be an easy road”, says Pierce, Round-Up’s co-owner and Miller’s partner. “There’s progress, but there’s always that hatred.” The bar’s owners organize charity events and back initiatives aimed at tackling the alarming rates of suicide and addiction in the community.Outside the Round-Up and its surrounding gayborhood, Texas conservatives are still fighting the “good” fight, trying to pass a “religious freedom” bill that would allow businesses to discriminate against the LGBTQ. Little wonder, then, that gay people travel from across the state to spin their spurs at the saloon.After 33 years at the bar, Pierce and Miller are thinking of hanging up their hats. They have their eye on a place in Mexico. Miller’s son, who is straight, will take over. “But it will always be a gay bar,” he says. “He knows not to mess with a good thing.”Smoove Gardner and Nicci Boroski won’t forget the night of 8 November 2016 in a hurry.The owners of The Back Door, Bloomington, Indiana’s radical queer bar, had organized a huge party for what they thought was going to be the election of the first female president of the United States. There were beanbags on the floor and hundreds of people sat around, sometimes going outside to smoke and relieve tension.“And then, as things started to go south, people started to get very drunk and very sad,” says Boroski, who identifies as gender queer and uses the they pronoun. “It was just piles of people cuddling and weeping together by the end of the night.”Trump’s election was an especially bitter blow because it ushered in Mike Pence, Indiana’s former governor, as the vice-president. Pence, who once said it was “God’s idea” to stop same-sex couples marrying, has a long history of working against pro-LGBTQ reforms. (Trump once joked Pence would like to “hang” gay people.)And so the fight was on. The election helped radicalize the queer community. “It matters now. You being active and paying attention. It matters,” says Gardner.Established in 2016 as a politically minded queer venue, The Back Door is tucked down an alleyway behind a car park. A Golden Girls mural adorns its exterior. Inside, the venue is a cosy, crazy den-like space, with wallscovered in zebra stripes and campy unicorn paintings. The gender neutral bathrooms the walls read: “NO MERCY FOR THE PATRIARCHY, BE A SLUT, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, BURN THE ICE VANS PLEASE …”The Back Door could come across as a little serious if it weren’t for the owners’ determination to have fun. “I feel like this space is part community center, part entertainment center – because there is so much crap happening right now that sometimes you just need to come dance and forget about it,” says Gardner.“Living joyously is a radical act in a broken world, especially in an unjust world. For people to come here and be their most fabulous selves and let go is an act of resistance,” says Boroski.On the night we visit, the bar is having a benefit for sex workers. A zaftig tattooed woman who bills herself as “Virgin Mary” poledances to Hozier’s Work Song in a jacket that reads: “Make Nazis Scared Again” as a queer crowd collects cash for National Abortion Fund and Red Light Legal. It’s all very woke David Lynch.The Back Door is not a space for everyone, and that’s the point. One patron complained online that they didn’t feel safe in the bar and worried there might be a riot – “or a massacre”, laughs Boroski.“We don’t want everybody here,” they say. “There are plenty of venues for heterosexuals.” And if someone doesn’t like the vibe? “I’m like, fantastic! See you never! Tell Google!”As for the future of LGBTQ rights, huge issues remain, Boroski says. Gay people – and especially white gay men – have made great strides since Stonewall, but even in the gay community, transphobia and racism are still issues.It’s a bitter irony that 50 years after Stonewall, while Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera – two trans women of colour and two of the main actors in the Stonewall riots – are being celebrated, trans people are still being “thrown under the bus”, and trans people of colour are “being killed left and right – and nobody gives a shit”, says Boroski. “And that’s a fucking problem.” If Indiana cracked down on the queers, The Back Door is exactly the sort of place where a riot could start, says Gardner.“In remembrance of Stonewall, keep a brick in your pocket,” says Boroski. “Don’t get complacent. But also live joyously, because that is a radical act.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1add93994c186ed09ddca3cca0da5883d6dadf3c/473_0_5054_3033/master/5054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53c515a63905a7a1166cef4bec2d2af8","title":"the new left economics how a network of thinkers is transforming capitalism","story":"After decades of rightwing dominance, a transatlantic movement of leftwing economists is building a practical alternative to neoliberalism. By  Andy BeckettFor almost half a century, something vital has been missing from leftwing politics in western countries. Since the 70s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom. It has exposed capitalism’s cruelties. It has sometimes won elections, and sometimes governed effectively afterwards. But it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society – or even provide a compelling vision of how that might be done. The left, in short, has not had an economic policy.Instead, the right has had one. Privatisation, deregulation, lower taxes for business and the rich, more power for employers and shareholders, less power for workers – these interlocking policies have intensified capitalism, and made it ever more ubiquitous. There have been immense efforts to make capitalism appear inevitable to depict any alternative as impossible.In this increasingly hostile environment, the left’s economic approach has been reactive – resisting these huge changes, often in vain – and often backward-looking, even nostalgic. For many decades, the same two critical analysts of capitalism, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, have continued to dominate the left’s economic imagination. Marx died in 1883, Keynes in 1946. The last time their ideas had a significant influence on western governments or voters was 40 years ago, during the turbulent final days of postwar social democracy. Ever since, rightwingers and centrists have caricatured anyone arguing that capitalism should be reined in – let alone reshaped or replaced – as wanting to take the world “back to the 70s”. Altering our economic system has been presented as a fantasy – no more practical than time travel.And yet, in recent years, that system has started to fail. Rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity, it has produced wage stagnation, ever more workers in poverty, ever more inequality, banking crises, the convulsions of populism and the impending climate catastrophe. Even senior rightwing politicians sometimes concede the seriousness of the crisis. At last year’s Conservative conference, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted that “a gap has opened up” in the west “between the theory of how a market economy delivers … and the reality”. He went on: “Too many people feel that … the system is not working for them.”There is a dawning recognition that a new kind of economy is needed: fairer, more inclusive, less exploitative, less destructive of society and the planet. “We’re in a time when people are much more open to radical economic ideas,” says Michael Jacobs, a former prime ministerial adviser to Gordon Brown. “The voters have revolted against neoliberalism. The international economic institutions – the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund – are recognising its downsides.” Meanwhile, the 2008 financial crisis and the previously unthinkable government interventions that halted it have discredited two central neoliberal orthodoxies: that capitalism cannot fail, and that governments cannot step in to change how the economy works.A huge political space has opened up. In Britain and the US, in many ways the most capitalist western countries, and the ones where its problems are starkest, an emerging network of thinkers, activists and politicians has begun to seize this opportunity. They are trying to construct a new kind of leftwing economics: one that addresses the flaws of the 21st-century economy, but which also explains, in practical ways, how future leftwing governments could create a better one.Christine Berry, a young British freelance academic, is one of the network’s central figures. “We’re stripping economics back to basics,” she says. “We want economics to ask: ‘Who owns these resources? Who has power in this company?’ Conventional economic discourse obfuscates these questions, to the benefit of those with power.”The new leftwing economics wants to see the redistribution of economic power, so that it is held by everyone – just as political power is held by everyone in a healthy democracy. This redistribution of power could involve employees taking ownership of part of every company or local politicians reshaping their city’s economy to favour local, ethical businesses over large corporations or national politicians making co-operatives a capitalist norm.This “democratic economy” is not some idealistic fantasy: bits of it are already being constructed in Britain and the US. And without this transformation, the new economists argue, the increasing inequality of economic power will soon make democracy itself unworkable. “If we want to live in democratic societies, then we need to … allow communities to shape their local economies,” write Joe Guinan and Martin O’Neill, both prolific advocates of the new economics, in a recent article for the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) – a thinktank previously associated with New Labour. “It is no longer good enough to see the economy as some kind of separate technocratic domain in which the central values of a democratic society somehow do not apply.” Moreover, Guinan and O’Neill argue, making the economy more democratic will actually help to revitalise democracy: voters are less likely to feel angry, or apathetic, if they are included in economic decisions that fundamentally affect their lives.The new economists’ enormously ambitious project means transforming the relationship between capitalism and the state between workers and employers between the local and global economy and between those with economic assets and those without. “Economic power and control must rest more equally,” declared a report last year by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), a radical London thinktank that has acted as an incubator for many of the new movement’s members and ideas.In the past, left-of-centre British governments have attempted to reshape the economy by taxation – usually focused on income rather than other forms of economic power – and by nationalisation, which usually meant replacing a private-sector management elite with a state-appointed one. Instead of such limited, patchily successful interventions, the new economists want to see much more systemic and permanent change. They want – at the least – to change how capitalism works. But, crucially, they want this change to be only partially initiated and overseen by the state, not controlled by it. They envisage a transformation that happens almost organically, driven by employees and consumers – a sort of non-violent revolution in slow motion.The result, the new economists claim, will be an economy that suits society, rather than – as we have at present – a society subordinated to the economy. The new economics, suggests Berry, isn’t really economics at all. It’s “a new view of the world”.In the excitable but often intellectually becalmed world of British politics, the arrival of a significant new set of ideas tends to generate certain responses. Events about it are packed out. Ambitious young researchers gravitate towards it. Adventurous older thinkers are intrigued by it. New intellectual institutions are created around it. Mainstream journalists initially dismiss it.Over the past year, the left’s new economics has acquired this status. Jacobs, who is nearing 60, spent the New Labour era trying, and largely failing, to persuade centrist politicians that the economy needed drastically reshaping. “But nowadays,” he told me, “I’m thinking: ‘Oh God, we finally might be able to do it.’”Like all the new economists I met, he talks very fast, cutting short sentences as if there is too much to explain in the time available. A longstanding environmentalist, he describes the emerging network of new economists as “an ecosystem”. Like the one that produced Thatcherism in the 70s, this network may involve only a few dozen people, whose polemics and talks and policy papers are being followed by an audience in the hundreds, but there is an intoxicating sense of political and economic taboos being broken, and of a potential new consensus being born.“There are British and American websites that publish a lot of our stuff, like openDemocracy, Jacobin and Novara. There are people producing stuff while freelancing for thinktanks – or setting up new thinktanks. And social media means the ideas spread, and collaborations happen, much faster than when leftwing economics was just about meetings and pamphlets,” Jacobs says. “It’s slightly incestuous, but it’s rather thrilling.”This ferment is beginning to solidify into a movement. The New Economy Organisers Network (Neon), a NEF spin-off based in London, runs workshops for leftwing activists, to learn how “to build support for a new economy” – for example, by telling effective “stories” about it in the mainstream media. Stir to Action, an activist organisation based in Bridport in Dorset, publishes a quarterly “magazine for the new economy”, and organises advice sessions in left-leaning cities such as Bristol and Oxford: Worker Co-ops: How to Get Started, Community Ownership: What If We Ran It Ourselves?“There’s a totally new impulse to activism about the economy now,” says the magazine’s editor, Jonny Gordon-Farleigh, who was previously involved in anticapitalist and environmental protests. “The movement has gone from oppose to propose.”Others in the movement are more bullish. Last autumn, a widely circulated article by Guinan and O’Neill in the leftwing journal Renewal claimed that McDonnell could be planning nothing less than a “transformation of the British economy … a radical programme for dismantling and displacing corporate and financial power in Britain”, in favour of the less privileged. Guinan told me: “John McDonnell is extremely intellectually curious. I haven’t seen another political figure at that level of seniority whose doors are so open to new thinking.”James Meadway, until recently one of McDonnell’s key advisers, is now writing a book about “an economy for the many”. Between 2010 and 2015, Meadway worked at NEF, where his reports and articles sketched out many of the new economists’ arguments. Several NEF staffers told me that since McDonnell became shadow chancellor, the usual relationship between leftwing thinktanks and Labour had been reversed: instead of desperately trying to draw the party’s attention to their proposals, they were struggling to keep up with Labour’s appetite for them. “They’re virtually asking, ‘Have you got anything else at the back of your cupboard?’” says one delighted but slightly perplexed NEF veteran. “We scrabble around, and give them anything we can come up with, as quickly as we can.”Last July, NEF published a report advocating a sharp increase in the number of British co-operatives. On one of its later pages, with almost no fanfare, the report also proposed that conventional companies be required to give their employees shares, to create what NEF called an “inclusive ownership fund”. In September, with a few modifications, the proposal became Labour party policy. “I’ve never seen anything like it, from thinktank idea to adoption as policy!” says Mathew Lawrence, one of the report’s authors. This month, a version of the policy was also adopted by the US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.And yet, outside McDonnell’s circle and the transatlantic radical left, the new economics has gone largely unnoticed – or been casually derided. The black holes of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are partly responsible, sucking attention away from everything else. But so is the radical nature of the new economics itself. Transforming or ending capitalism as we know it – the new economists differ as to which is the goal – is a difficult idea for most British politicians and journalists to take on board. After half a century accepting the economic status quo, they associate any leftwing alternatives to it either with out-of-date postwar social democracy – aka “the 70s” – or with leftwing authoritarianism, with present-day Venezuela or the Soviet Union.However often McDonnell says in interviews that he wants to see a democratic economy, the adjective most frequently applied to him is still “Marxist”. “The new economic thinking is almost like a frequency that can’t be heard,” says Guinan.But with neoliberalism ailing, and the right bereft of other economic ideas, as the Conservative leadership contest is currently demonstrating, the left’s new economics may have a long fut ure – whether or not McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party wins power. To borrow a line from Thatcher, there is now an alternative.The dream of a democratic economy has flickered on the margins of leftwing politics for at least a century. During the early 1920s, the British socialist theorists GDH Cole and RH Tawney both wrote fresh, provocative books arguing that workers should manage themselves, rather than submit to employers or shareholders – or to the state, as more orthodox Labour thinkers envisaged. In economic life, as in politics, Tawney argued in 1921, “men should not be ruled by an authority which they cannot control”.This empowerment of the workers was intended to be the first step in a larger transformation. “The real aim,” wrote Cole in 1920, should be “wresting bit by bit from the hands of the possessing classes the economic power which they now exercise”, in order to ultimately “make possible an equitable distribution of the national income and a reasonable reorganisation of Society as a whole”.Yet Cole was vague about how this overturning of the traditional order would happen. He ruled out a revolution, and a general strike, on the grounds that workers did not have the necessary access to weapons, or the economic resources to beat their employers in a protracted industrial struggle. A bold Labour government could, in theory, pass the necessary legislation but the Labour administrations of the 1920s and 30s were cautious, and did not last long.When Labour did acquire the confidence and time to reconfigure the economy, during the premierships of Clement Attlee in the 40s and Harold Wilson in the 60s, the party chose to do so through Whitehall plans and bureaucracies, such as Wilson’s Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), rather than by democratising the economy. The results were mixed: the DEA lasted only five years.It was not until the 70s that a powerful Labour politician became interested in democratising the economy. Unusually for a Westminster grandee, Tony Benn paid close attention to the decline of deference and growth of inidualism during the decade. “More people want to do more for themselves,” he wrote in 1970. “Technology releases forces that permit and encourage decentralisation … It must be a prime objective of socialists to work for the redistribution of power.”In 1974, Wilson made Benn secretary of state for industry. The economy was struggling. Benn oversaw and subsidised worker-run cooperatives at three ailing large businesses: the Scottish Daily News, a Glasgow newspaper Kirkby Manufacturing and Engineering, a Liverpool maker of radiators and Meriden, a producer of motorcycles in the West Midlands. The challenges these co-operatives faced – a lack of previous investment, and strong foreign or domestic competitors – were made worse by unsympathetic, economically conservative civil servants in Benn’s department. An even-handed 1981 report on the cooperatives by the leftwing magazine New Internationalist described them as doomed from the start – they were “crippled giants”.The Scottish Daily News cooperative lasted five months. The Kirby cooperative did better. Eric Heffer, a minister working for Benn, found trade union shop stewards there “transformed by their experiences” of helping run the business. They became “real worker-managers”. The cooperative made it through the mid-70s recession. But soon after the 1979 election, Margaret Thatcher’s incoming government terminated the experiment by cancelling Kirkby’s subsidies. Meriden survived the change of government, and another recession in the early 80s. But it went bankrupt in 1983.Benn himself lasted only a year in the industry department, before he was removed by Wilson, who had never completely accepted his radicalism. Benn never held such a pivotal economic post again. Just as significantly, the saga “undermined the co-operative option in Labour party policymaking circles for decades to come,” says Gordon-Farleigh.From Benn’s demotion in 1975 until Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader 40 years later, the Labour hierarchy broadly accepted that the economy should be based on profit, competition, and top-down management. The attempts by Benn and others on the British left during the 70s to establish what they sometimes provocatively called “workers’ control” were largely forgotten, or remembered as just another of a derided decade’s failed utopias. The chance for a democratic economy seemed to have gone.Yet during the lean years that followed for the British left, another experiment in democratising the economy began – across the Atlantic, in a country less associated with revolts against capitalism. It was more local, but also more thorough than Benn’s backing of a scattering of vulnerable co-operatives, and it sought to mobilise the power of consumers rather than producers.Gar Alperovitz is an 83-year-old American economist and activist. Since the 60s, he has doggedly promoted economic innovations that put social before commercial goals. Often, he has been a fringe figure, but intermittently he has attracted wide attention. In 1983, he featured heavily in a Time magazine cover story about the future of the economy. In 2000, at the University of Maryland, he co-founded the Democracy Collaborative, a centre for research about how to revive the political and economic life of declining parts of the US, which gradually expanded into an activist body as well.“Troubled American cities are in a more advanced state of decay than their British equivalents,” says Guinan, who has worked for the Democracy Collaborative for a decade. “But American local government also has greater powers. So you have the ability to create radical new models from the ground up.”In 2008, the Democracy Collaborative began working in Cleveland, one of America’s poorest big cities, which had been losing jobs and residents for decades. The activists followed an Alperovitz strategy called “community wealth-building”. It aims to end struggling local economies’ reliance on unequal relationships with distant, wealth-extracting corporations – such as chain retailers – and to base these economies around local, more socially conscious businesses instead.In Cleveland, the Democracy Collaborative helped set up a solar power company, an industrial laundry, and a city-centre hydroponic farm growing lettuces and basil. All three enterprises were owned by their employees, and some of their profits went to a holding company tasked with establishing more cooperatives in the city. All three enterprises have succeeded, so far. The goal of the project was summed up in blunt, almost populist terms by one of the Democracy Collaborative’s co-founders, Ted Howard, in 2017: “Stop the leakage of money out of our community.” Yet “community wealth building” also has a more subtle purpose: it is a concrete demonstration that economic decisions can be based on more than neoliberalism’s narrow criteria.Howard was speaking at a new economics conference in England, which had been organised by McDonnell. The two men are on first-name terms. Last year, McDonnell introduced Howard at another Labour event, in Preston: “We bring him across on a regular basis now, to explain the work that he’s done.”McDonnell has long been interested in decentralising and democratising the economy. He frequently cites Tawney, Cole and Benn in speeches. During the 80s, McDonnell was deputy leader and effectively the chancellor of the Greater London Council (GLC), which pursued Benn-style experiments with state-backed co-operatives, with similarly mixed results, until it was abolished by Thatcher in 1986.Contrary to his usual portrayal as a statist ogre, McDonnell believes there are limits to how far the left can increase taxes and government spending. In his view, many voters are unwilling, or simply unable, to pay much more tax – especially when living standards are squeezed, as now. He also believes that central government has lost authority: it is seen as simultaneously too weak, short of money thanks to austerity and too strong – too intrusive and domineering towards citizens. Instead of relying on the state to create a better society, one of McDonnell’s close allies argues, leftwing governments, at both the municipal and national level, “have to get into changing how capitalism works”.In recent years, with McDonnell and Corbyn’s encouragement, and guidance from the Democracy Collaborative, many of the principles of “the Cleveland model”, as it is reverently known in transatlantic leftwing circles, have been adopted by the Labour-run council in the small, ex-industrial city of Preston in Lancashire. The regeneration has been promoted as a foretaste of Britain under a Corbyn government.Preston’s hilltop city centre, which had been fading for decades, now has a refurbished and busy covered market, new artists’ studios in former council offices, and coffee and craft beer being sold from converted shipping containers right behind the town hall. All these enterprises have been facilitated by the council. Less visibly, but probably more importantly, the city’s large concentration of other public sector bodies – a hospital, a university, a police headquarters – have been persuaded by the council to procure goods and services locally whenever possible, becoming what the Democracy Collaborative calls “anchor institutions”. They now spend almost four times as much of their budgets in Preston as they did in 2013.The council leader is Matthew Brown, an intense, angular 46-year-old who was partly inspired to enter politics by seeing Benn on television as a teenager. “What we’re doing in Preston is common sense, but it’s also ideological,” Brown told me, when we met in his sparse office. “We’re living through a systemic crisis of capitalism, and we’ve got to create alternatives.” By doing so – especially at a time when local councils are supposed to have been hugely weakened by government cuts – Preston is in small but visible ways undermining the authority of neoliberalism, dependent as it is on the insistence that no other economic options are possible.I asked whether he had any doubts about a city with a population of less than 150,000 acting as a model for reshaping the whole British economy – and by implication, economies beyond. “No,” he said. “I’m quite strong-minded.”There is a confidence about the new economists, which comes as a surprise after all the left’s defeats during the 80s and 90s. But with capitalism less effective and popular than it was then, the new economists believe they are now engaged in what the political theorist Antonio Gramsci – a big influence on them and McDonnell – called a “war of position”: a steady accumulation of alliances, ideas and public credibility. Berry describes this process as a “transition” that can lead to a different economy. McDonnell told me in 2017 that he wanted “a staged transformation of our economic system”. If enough other Labour councils copy Preston – and quite a few are interested – then even without a Corbyn government, let alone any kind of socialist revolution, the British economy will have moved leftwards, both in the priorities it chooses and the interests it favours.He offered no more details. But the “inclusive ownership fund” policy adopted by Labour shows the potential of the new economic ideas. The funds are intended to be Trojan horses: inserting into a company’s ownership structure a group of shareholders – its employees – who are more likely to favour higher wages and long-term investment. “The funds are meant to tip the balance,” says Lawrence, “towards a different kind of corporate culture.” Or as the writer and activist Hilary Wainwright, one of the Labour left’s shrewdest thinkers since the 70s, puts it: “Radical change, when it destabilises the status quo in the right way, creates further opportunities for change.”Before NEF, Fahnbulleh worked for the cabinet office and the 10 Downing Street strategy unit. She predicts there will be Whitehall resistance to the new economics: “Whitehall hates big change – every time.” Jacobs, who has longer experience of government, is slightly more optimistic. “Some of the younger Treasury people will probably be quite excited by a new economic approach. Some of the older ones will think it’s all wrong. And others will just implement whatever the government asks.”He has helped run seminars for McDonnell and his team about what to expect from Whitehall, and how to respond. “My advice is, ‘If you want to do something new, set up a new unit, and recruit. You’ll get people joining who want to do new things.” But Benn’s experience at the department of industry suggest that outflanking Whitehall’s conservatives may not be that simple.And then there is the business establishment. Since Thatcher, it has become accustomed to deferential governments, to getting its own way over other interest groups, and to profits and share prices trumping other measures of a company’s economic or social value. The intention of the new economists to end these imbalances has not gone down well. “The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) really hates inclusive ownership,” says one McDonnell ally. “You can feel the chill whenever we bring it up.”When I asked the CBI for their thoughts on the new economics, there was a week-long silence, and then, after I chased them, a terse statement: “Labour seems determined to impose rules that display a wilful misunderstanding of business.”The new economists say they are not intimidated. “We in the movement need to be absolutely frank about this,” says Guinan. “A democratic and an exploitative economy are fundamentally incompatible. We should mount a straightforward, left-populist attack on these business interests. We should say to them: ‘Off you go to Singapore!’ The left shouldn’t be afraid of a little creative destruction”, he says, cheekily borrowing a phrase usually used by free-marketeers. Jacobs agrees: “Exploitative companies can go to the wall.”That might sound like a reckless leftwing fantasy. But the new economists argue convincingly that hugely disruptive change is coming to the British economy, anyway – thanks to Brexit, automation and the climate emergency. “Brexit alone will require a very interventionist state” to help the economy adapt, says Lawrence. “It will make it much harder for a civil servant to say, ‘You simply can’t do that.’”But what do the new economists want to come after neoliberal capitalism? In Preston, after Brown had spoken evangelically to me about the virtues of “local businesses” and “local jobs”, I asked whether his council was actually saving capitalism in the city – by making it more socially sensitive – rather than supplanting it. For once, he paused. “We’ve got to be pragmatic,” he said. “We are still in a free-market environment. And I don’t see local businesses as big capitalists, anyway. The vast majority only have one or two people working for them. There’s almost no one to exploit. Shareholders are not involved.” Not everyone on the left would see small businesses – often keen supporters of rightwing parties and austere social and economic policies – in such benign terms. But Brown went on: “The Labour party, nationally, is getting away from the old pro-businessanti-business argument. Creating social value is what matters.”Later I asked McDonnell, too, whether his approach risked saving rather than replacing capitalism. He smiled, and went into the gnomic mode he adopts when talking about tricky issues. “Who incorporates who ...” he said. “That’s the debate!” Then his smile turned more mischievous. A Corbyn government, he said, would “welcome” business “into our warm embrace”.The McDonnell ally I spoke to said that whenever the question of the economy’s long-term trajectory came up in Labour discussions, “We avoid that conversation. There is no consensus in the party.” Then he added: “Personally, I’d be quite happy if Britain ended up as Denmark.”McDonnell often cites Germany as another country where capitalism is more benign. Wainwright, who has known McDonnell for decades, has a usefully flexible prediction about what might happen to Britain’s economic culture if he becomes chancellor. “En route to a socialist society,” she says, “there might be moments when a different capitalism emerges” – ie, a more benign one.Yet the problem for the left with settling for “a different capitalism”, however temporarily, is that it may simply enable capitalism to regroup, and then resume its Darwinian progress. Arguably this is exactly what happened in Britain during the last century. After the politically explosive economic slump of the 1930s – the precursor to today’s crisis of capitalism – during the postwar years many business leaders seemed to accept the need for a more egalitarian economy, and developed close relationships with Labour politicians. But once the economy and society had been stabilised, and rightwingers such as Thatcher started making a seductive case for a return to raw capitalism, the businessmen switched sides.Another difficulty for the new economists and their political allies is to persuade voters – brought up with the idea that profit and growth are the only economic outcomes that matter – that other values should matter more from now on. Even saving the environment is still a hard sell. “The effect of economic growth on the planet is not an issue that’s talked about nearly enough on the left,” admits Berry. “As for de-growth” – the current green term for dropping growth as an economic objective – “the Labour party won’t touch it with a bargepole.” McDonnell’s ally agreed. “De-growth,” he said, “is just appalling labelling.” Guinan says the problem is not just presentational: “a politics of de-growth has not yet been invented that will carry the public.”Instead, Labour have recently begun promoting a version of the Green New Deal: an enticing but still largely theoretical scheme advocated by steadily more leftists and environmentalists in Britain and the US over the past decade. It aims to address the climate emergency and some of capitalism’s problems simultaneously, by a huge increase in government support for green technologies and the highly skilled, hopefully well-paid jobs needed to create them. In a speech this week, McDonnell said that this project needed to be Britain’s biggest peacetime undertaking since the Attlee government’s conversion of the economy from war to peace during the 40s. In April, the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, a McDonnell protege, wrote a  article advocating a “green industrial revolution”, including “deep-water turbines in the North Sea”, which “could provide four times Europe’s entire electricity demand” and “could be built and delivered from the UK”. It was quite a thrilling vision but the turbines were the only potential new technology the article mentioned.Another enormous issue that the new economists often skirt is whether many of today’s workers really want more of a voice in their workplaces. When “industrial democracy” was last a popular idea on the left, in the 70s, work was arguably more fulfilling and central to people’s lives than it had ever been before. Office jobs were replacing factory jobs, work was a strong engine of social mobility, and membership of powerful trade unions had accustomed the majority of British employees to being consulted, of having some agency in their working lives. But in 2019, empowering experiences at work are less common. For more and more people, however well-qualified, employment is short-term, low-status, unrewarding – barely part of their identity at all.Gordon-Farleigh has spent years trying to interest people in forming co-operatives, and not always succeeding. “Contemporary capitalism has produced a pacified, passive workforce,” he says. “A lot of people even like to feel a bit alienated by capitalism – to not really understand how it works. They need to be reskilled, politically. Then we have to look at what economic powers they actually want.”In April, after waiting for a pause in the seemingly endless winter of Brexit arguments, Mathew Lawrence launched a new economics thinktank, Common Wealth, which aims to draw all the strands of the movement together, with an evening event in London. After an uplifting but slightly too slick film about Common Wealth’s mission had been shown on a big screen – which was similar in tone and content to a recent Labour party political broadcast called Our Town – Lawrence was introduced to the audience by Guinan. In the speech that followed, Lawrence covered so much ground that his voice became a mutter, too fast for anyone unfamiliar with the new economics to follow. During this formal bit of the evening, Common Wealth risked feeling like a project for insiders – just another London thinktank, with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband on its board.Yet the rest of the launch felt different. The hired room was in the East End, far from the usual thinktank belt around Westminster, and it was packed, and loud with earnest talk. Almost everyone was in their 20s or 30s, many of them with scuffed Dr Martens shoes and austere modern haircuts – the now-familiar sight of British millennials gathering to discuss changing the world. Two hours after the start of the event, people were still arriving, and hardly anyone had left. When I did, just before 11, the lights were still on in the nearby office towers of the City of London, which overshadows the East End, and the economy of the whole country beyond. But walking away from the buzzing room, especially after a bottle of the Common Wealth craft ale that had been made for the occasion, it was possible to believe that the bankers’ best days might be numbered, and that the new economics would tell us how.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ab60184f0c6400a9f42a41148bb92840c334b36/0_0_3210_2165/master/3210.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9ebdd276ae31ad11d98d382bda56c9ad 1440w","title":"hmrc pushes massive vat increase for new solar battery systems","story":"Homes hoping to shrink their carbon footprints by installing a solar-battery system face a steep VAT increase from October under new laws proposed by HMRC.Meanwhile, home coal supplies will continue to receive the lower VAT rate.The Renewable Energy Association (REA) said the rise “contradicts the government’s commitment to tackling climate change” only weeks after parliament declared a climate emergency.It also warned that the move would push back the take-up of solar-battery systems by years even as the UK works towards becoming a net zero carbon economy by 2050.Nina Skorupska, the REA’s chief executive, said the increase would “create a barrier to British homes and businesses who are seeking to take action on climate change and reduce their bills by installing solar with battery storage”.She said the government “should be doing all it can to install these technologies rather than enacting barriers”.HMRC has blamed EU tax laws for the planned rise because they rule out lower VAT rates for energy saving equipment under state aid rules.The European court of justice ruled in 2015 that energy saving materials should not have been receiving the reduced rate of tax. This led to an increase in VAT for solar systems installed at new-build homes in 2016, but did not affect the majority of houses which would require retrofitting. Those houses will now be affected by the higher rate.The REA has called on HMRC to cancel the latest increase, which would come into effect as the UK prepares to leave the EU. Any rise should be cancelled as soon as possible after Brexit, the trade group added.The calls have won the support of more than 11,000 members of the public who have signed a petition by the green energy supplier Good Energy to call off the increase.Juliet Davenport, Good Energy’s chief executive, said the rise was “possibly the worst way to respond to a climate emergency”.“The government should be seeking to be a world leader in renewable technologies, but it’s damaging our successful solar industry and putting green jobs at risk. We urge the Treasury to listen to the thousands of petitioners who want to play their part in fighting climate change,” she said.HMRC brought the secondary legislation to parliament on Monday after carrying out an industry consultation on the plans in April and May this year. It has said it is offering as much tax relief as possible for home renewable energy systems while ensuring the UK is in line with EU law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b718af51ee8c61bc65ccbcf7d1377ca77783fae/0_114_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca5c4d1388d87f49bfafaabfb9465601","title":"jeremy hunt pledge increase defence spending","story":"Tory leadership hopeful’s plan would use up more than half of £27bn fiscal headroom set aside by chancellorJeremy Hunt will promise to increase spending on defence by a quarter during the next five years, as he seeks to woo the grassroots Tories who will select Britain’s next prime minister.The foreign secretary is the underdog in the race to succeed Theresa May, with Boris Johnson the clear favourite, but the defence pledge is the latest of a series of policy announcements aimed at enthusing the Tory grassroots – and highlighting the lack of clear policies in Johnson’s leadership platform.Hunt will say on Tuesday: “I was the person who secured a historic funding boost for the NHS and as prime minister I’ll do the same for defence. Everyone knows Britain is a world-leading soft power but, to be credible, we need to show that we are determined to remain a first-rank military power.“My plan for defence will give our brave troops the backing they need and show the world that, when it comes to the new threats to western values, Britain is back and Britain’s voice will be strong.”Hunt’s plan would be expected to increase defence spending by £15bn by 2023-24. That would use up more than half of the £27bn of fiscal headroom set aside by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who told MPs in his spring statement that it would be possible to ease austerity, but only if the government could avoid a no-deal Brexit.Hammond told all the Conservative leadership candidates to avoid making unfunded spending promises during the campaign to avoid squandering the Tories’ reputation for managing the public finances.The chancellor said earlier this month: “We have over a long period built the hard-won reputation for fiscal responsibility and managing the economy and the public finances and I want to ensure that the candidates commit to carrying on with the work that we’ve been doing over the last nine years.”Johnson used his  column to set out plans for increasing the higher-rate income tax threshold from £50,000 to £80,000, a generous tax cut that would go entirely to higher earners.All the leadership candidates – who have now been narrowed down to just Hunt and Johnson – made spending promises, on everything from education to social care.The defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, praising Hunt’s promise of what his campaign called a “war chest”, said: “The first duty of any prime minister and any government is to protect the United Kingdom and further her interests. The British public want us to have clout in the world. We must give the men and women of our armed forces what they need to do the job we ask of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3072177a30465dde1ed5ee307a24366756aa43f4/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f76abfc3b068894b3e0816d1a99b6935","title":"theresa may yawned god this was dull sketch","story":"Where once Commons jibes might have hurt, now they bounce off. She has a perspective on her lifeHow times change. Two months ago a statement by the prime minister on the latest EU council meeting would have been considered a significant occasion. One worthy of a full House of Commons. Now the government is so marginal – not just to the EU but to the country itself – that the chamber was barely a third full. And those who did bother to turn up were only there because it was a slow Monday afternoon, there was sod all on TV and they had nothing better to do with their lives.Semi-retirement seems to suit Theresa May. When she first announced she had been forced out of No 10, her face and body appeared contorted with grief and anger. As if the loss was unbearable. Time is proving a quick healer. She is learning to cope with the indifference of her Tory MPs by being equally as indifferent to them. Where once their jibes and accusations might hurt, now they bounce off. She has a perspective on her life. She knows she is surrounded by shabby, untrustworthy careerists and she is going to enjoy every second of schadenfreude as her successors inevitably crash and burn.Not that she’s going to let that stop her giving them a little nudge towards the edge of the abyss. Why deny herself such pleasures? May began by trying to rack her brains for anything that had happened in Brussels the previous week. To be honest, she’d been a bit demob happy, helping herself to several too many glasses of wine and hadn’t really paid attention to a word anyone had said. What was the point? It wasn’t as if either she or the UK were going to be involved for much longer.“Er … ” she said. There had been some chat about the climate crisis and something about Turkey drilling in the eastern Mediterranean she hadn’t quite followed. Ah yes! There had also been something about disinformation and fake news and how it was generally a bad idea.Why only that morning there had been a photograph of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds on the front page of the Evening Standard that had been photoshopped from the front cover of Nadine Dorries’ latest tear-jerking novel about a pair of star-crossed lovers who surmounted impossible odds to find true happiness in Downing Street. The prime minister was so outraged she was thinking of reporting Johnson to the Independent Press Standards Organisation for breaching his own privacy.In reply, Jeremy Corbyn chose to focus on Brexit. Could May think of anything useful that had happened over the past three years? Did she regret legitimising a no deal for either of the two idiots in line to succeed her? Did she agree that Johnson clearly had no idea what he was talking about in regard to both tariffs and an implementation period in a no-deal Brexit? Philip Hammond, the only member of the cabinet who bothered to turn up – presumably he’s making the most of his time on the frontbench before he too is fired – nodded enthusiastically in responseRead my lips, May yawned. God this was dull. Why was she even here? There had been no discussion of Brexit because the EU was sick to death of the UK. They’d fallen over themselves to be accommodating but now just wanted us to piss off. The sooner the better. We were an embarrassment to them and to ourselves. So she really didn’t have anything to say about Brexit. But since she was here and only had a few more weeks of this shitshow to get through, she’d offer some thoughts. Of course Boris was an incompetent liar who didn’t have a clue what he was doing. That was the whole point of him. So good luck to the Tory party and the country.Sensing there was going to be no pushback, the SNP’s Ian Blackford joined the pile-on with a dig about Johnson’s record as foreign secretary. May smirked. Yes, she admitted. It had been a terrible decision to appoint him to a job that required concentration and diplomacy. It had always been the government’s view that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been visiting Iran on holiday and she’d been horrified when Johnson had apparently tried to get her banged up in jail for longer. And don’t get her started on his trip to Myanmar.The session ended with Chris Bryant and Sarah Wollaston asking if the new prime minister would address parliament before the recess. May shrugged. This was above her pay grade. It was down to whoever took over from her. But if, as looked likely, it turned out to be Johnson, then the answer was almost certainly no. He had a lot of holiday booked. Fences to mend. Children to count. Somewhere secluded and quiet. Somewhere no one could hear you screaming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

Pakistan have been traditionally variable. Sri Lanka put in some feeble performances before swarming the tournament host. West Indies flattered, then were flattened.And when England play Australia at Lord’s on Tuesday, there is a sense that it will answer questions about both teams. For England’s part, whether they will flourish or falter when the pressure really starts to build. For Australia’s, whether this current team can really mount a credible challenge for the trophy.For Australia, there is at least no intimidation at untrodden ground. Winning the thing is almost humdrum. “The fact that we’ve got six guys in our squad who were part of the 2015 World Cup win is really valuable,” said the captain, Aaron Finch, in understated fashion. “We’ve also got Ricky Ponting with us, Brad Haddin with us, as coaching staff who have won World Cups, and multiple World Cups as well.”Last year Finch’s team looked like a rabble and even through this tournament there has been a sense of disjointedness to how the batting order is composed and what roles batsmen are there to play. Yet the team have found a way past most opponents. “I think over World Cup history Australia have had that record of peaking at the right time of the tournament,” said Finch.Taking on England will offer a test of whether that is the case this time round. Of the other teams in the top four, Australia were well beaten by India and are yet to play New Zealand. England, despite stumbles against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, are still a power-packed lineup that do not take kindly to defeat, with a recent record of bouncing back after a lost match in spectacular fashion.Lord’s, though, is far from the best venue for the kind of high-risk, high-reward approach of modern England. The pitches tend to be slower and scoring rates lower, especially for new batsmen.On the evidence of the venue’s first World Cup date, when Pakistan beat South Africa, these pitches are taking spin as well. With fast bowlers going for plenty of runs and Imran Tahir low on overs, South Africa turned to Aiden Markram’s very part-time spin through the middle overs of Sunday’s game and found he turned the ball appreciably. Pakistan’s spinners also made telling contributions.“I think we saw as the game went on it started to turn a little bit more than we probably expected,” Finch said. “It looked like there was a little bit in it to start with, and then it dried out and sort of powdered up and started turning.”The logical upshot is Australia might have to defy their own convention and play the off-spinner Nathan Lyon alongside the leg‑spinner Adam Zampa. Lyon has had nothing to do in this tournament except sing anthems and ferry beverages. Nathan Coulter-Nile, the first choice for the third fast bowler, has contributed only four wickets in five matches and has often struggled with his accuracy, while Lyon has recently shown a mastery at suffocating the scoring through the middle of an innings. In the warm-up match against England in Southampton Lyon got through his 10 overs at a cost of 37 runs.Of course, Australian managers are more conservative than any in routinely picking three fast bowlers, especially if Ponting in his coaching role is currently as influential as it appears. Ponting captaining spinners was like a grumpy cop in a buddy comedy teaming up with a flamboyant lounge singer or a rascally dog: he didn’t want them, didn’t trust them, and grudgingly accepted their presence to get a job done. Except in Ponting’s film there were no eventual scenes of bonding and acceptance, where the real Ashes were the friends we made along the way.Adaptability has not necessarily been a strong point for Australia in this campaign, with wins coming match by match based on the pure quality of some of the players, rather than a finely tuned execution of strategy. But against England’s aggressive batting, having the ability to change things up is key.The blue-chip pace pair of Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins pick themselves, but the supporting cast of Lyon, Zampa, medium pace from Marcus Stoinis and more spin from Glenn Maxwell might be the more useful mix than the standard three-pronged pace. Whether selectors can be that adaptable is a different question.It is the old question of what your opponent would least prefer you to do. Given the home team’s stop-start campaign, their recent record at Lord’s, and the nature of the wicket on Sunday, an answer isn’t too hard to guess. With four wins in the bank, two more needed, and three games to play, England in this World Cup are very close to having a problem. Australia have the chance to prove they are once again the team to create one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab1a5eaa060e3f0596a3c27f66c2119eda4eed5d/0_142_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef47fca8e5cd7c1c8ca4119103dbc713","title":"bangladesh shakib al hasan afghanistan","story":"If England needed a reminder of just how fragile their hopes of making the World Cup semi-finals currently are, the presence of Bangladesh breathing down their neck in the standings following this convincing win against Afghanistan provided it. Roared on by a boisterous army of Tiger-clad fans, Bangladesh produced a performance that has infused them with genuine belief they can reach the last four of this tournament.They now sit fifth in the table on seven points, one behind England and with matches against India and Pakistan remaining. If Bangladesh win both, Eoin Morgan’s team will need to win two of their final three group matches to beat them to a place in the top four. With games against Australia, whom England face at Lord’s on Tuesday, followed by India and New Zealand that is certainly no given.What will worry them most is the momentum and confidence this victory will hand Bangladesh. Beating Indiathe at Edgbaston next Tuesday may seem like a tall order for Mashrafe Mortaza’s side. Yet with Shakib Al Hasan in this kind of form they will believe anything is possible. Here was more evidence to back up the claim he is the best all-rounder in the world as he became only the second player in World Cup history to score a half-century and claim a five-wicket haul in the same match.“Shakib has been fantastic throughout the tournament, he’s been phenomenal,” said Mortaza. “We’ll try our level best against Pakistan and India. It’s still wide open. You never know.”Bangladesh’s man of the moment was equally buoyant about his team’s chances of progress, Shakib saying: “England have three matches left and we have two so it’s difficult mathematically. But having said that anything can happen. We have to believe.”Shakib’s day started with a fifth 50-plus score of the tournament that saw him overtake Australia’s David Warner as the World Cup’s leading runscorer. Those 51 runs – plus a composed 83 from Mushfiqur Rahim – helped Bangladesh post a total of 262 for seven on the same pitch that was used when Afghanistan fell 12 runs short of chasing down 225 against India on Saturday.This contest was nowhere near as close thanks in large part to the left-arm spin of Shakib, who ripped the heart out of Afghanistan’s pursuit of 263 with a haul of five for 29 – the best inidual bowling figures of the tournament so far.They included the key wickets of the captain, Gulbadin Naib, and then Mohammad Nabi for a duck in the space of three balls during the 29th over. It reduced a team who were already struggling to keep up with the required run rate to 104 for four. By the time Shakib struck again four overs later, tempting Asghar Afghan into a slog sweep that saw him caught in the deep, they were even further behind.A brilliant direct hit from Liton Das at midwicket that ran out Ikram Alikhil all but ended this match as a contest as Afghanistan limped to 132 for six, still needing 131 from 89 balls to pull off an unlikely win.In the 43rd over, Shakib struck for the fifth time, Najibullah Zadran stumped after being flummoxed by a quicker arm ball. Zadran’s dismissal saw the Bangladeshi emulate the all-round feat of Yuvraj Singh against Ireland in 2011 – the Indian having scored an unbeaten 50 after taking five for 31 on that occasion.Mustafizur Rahman’s two wickets and another for Mohammad Saifuddin then polished off the tail as Bangladesh bowled out their opponents for 200 in 47 overs.Afghanistan have yet to register a victory at this tournament and they did themselves no favours in this match after deciding to bowl first on a used pitch. It allowed Bangladesh to control the contest from the very start, taking few risks as they successfully calculated a score of around 250 would set up victory.The Afghan fielding – summed up by Dawlat Zadran’s drop of Saifuddan in the final over of the Bangladesh innings – was again poor here as it has been for much of the tournament.Yet even if it had been flawless, Afghanistan would still have been powerless to stop the force of nature that is Shakib."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c965a2239a47002276b410024d7c96ba62719e74/0_236_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5acb32a3f1aa152f7355254a259e4c4b","title":"england cricket world cup news australia","story":"Eoin Morgan has declined to join the chorus of voices asking supporters not to boo Steve Smith and David Warner, adding that the pair may have served bans for last year’s ball-tampering scandal but rebuilding public trust takes longer.Speaking before Tuesday’s World Cup group game between England and Australia – which Jason Roy will miss with a hamstring injury – Morgan was asked if he would follow India’s Virat Kohli and Justin Langer, the Australia head coach, by requesting that fans go easy on Smith and Warner.But despite 15 months having passed since the Cape Town incident that led to the Australian batsmen being stood down from leadership roles, suspended from international cricket for a year and the subject of widespread public criticism, Morgan believes it is not in his remit as England captain to issue orders to fans.“Who knows how long it will take? I don’t think I could do anything, or should so anything, to try influence the fans to change their mind.”Morgan admitted Kohli’s much-praised intervention during India’s win over Australia a fortnight ago, in which he asked fans to clap Smith, prompted him to consider a repeat, only to decide on reflection that “it didn’t sit right with me”.Jonny Bairstow, who struck up a friendship with Warner during this year’s Indian Premier League, used his Daily  column to allude to double standards on the issue, chiefly that Darren Lehmann, the former Australia coach, urged home fans to make Stuart Broad “cry” during the 2013-14 Ashes trip.While England have already faced the pair during a warm-up match in Southampton, Lord’s is the first meeting in an international. The stewards have been briefed to be on the lookout should any booing directed at Smith and Warner turn into personal abuse if so, it may violate ticketing terms and result in any offender being ejected.The Australia captain, Aaron Finch, who has heard booing directed at the pair throughout their time in England, said: “It hasn’t affected our boys one bit. I can honestly say that, if anything, it’s given them a bit more motivation.“If a handful of people or a whole stadium are booing them, it doesn’t make any difference to how hard they watch the ball or whether they doubt themselves or anything like that. I think it’s a bit of white noise, to be fair.”Warner has certainly appeared unaffected, scoring 447 runs in six innings, including two centuries. The 32-year-old has been more watchful in doing so but Morgan said if he does switch to his more typical aggression, England’s bowlers have plans.Morgan is once again without one of his own incendiary openers. Roy had a fresh scan on his hamstring tear on Monday morning but despite netting afterwards, Sunday’s meeting with India at Edgbaston is now the revised goal.The injury gave rise to talk of whether Alex Hales, who was “de-selected” from the World Cup due to a recreational drug ban, could return. Morgan is unable to state on the record that the right-hander is now ineligible but said, after speaking to the national selector Ed Smith, that the pecking order of replacements remains the same.This probably means Joe Denly and Dawid Malan, who featured before the tournament, are next in line. In Roy’s absence, James Vince once again gets the chance to prove his obvious talent can translate into an innings of substance from 12 ODI caps to date, the stylish right-hander has only one half-century.Vince is the junior member of a batting lineup that is looking to make amends following Friday’s collapse to 212 all out against Sri Lanka in Leeds, a 20-run defeat that increases the pressure as they look to secure a semi-final spot.“Guys have performed under pressure for a very long time,” said Morgan. “They have performed under the pressure of being favourites for the last two years in series, both away from home and at home, and I have no question mark about producing under pressure.”Finch added: “We are expecting England to come out ultra-hard and take the game on, which has been one of their main traits over the last couple of years. I think the pressure is increasing on everyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587e8ef27665a93f28adf26cab324166ef328b0b/0_188_5647_3388/master/5647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad907b6ce79f6f719696bf7e79eed710","title":"idris elba kwame kwei armah tree interview bereavement","story":"The actor celebrates all big events in his life by wrapping his arms round a sturdy trunk.

He’s got a tattoo of one on his left arm, partially hidden today by a black T-shirt – but that’s not all. Whenever Elba needs to mark a major event in his life – birthdays, new years, that kind of thing – he heads outside and wraps his arms around a trunk. “I just feel a massive connection to the roots that are underneath, which are very high and wide, and to the oxygen that comes from the top,” he says. “And then there’s me in the middle … Idris Elba, tree-hugger!”He lets out a burst of laughter, as does the director Kwame Kwei-Armah.

The pair have known each other for decades but this is the first time they’ve worked together. “The seeds are laid right,” Elba says, and the metaphors continue, with much talk of “cultivating” and “planting” in their creative process.The production’s “deepest roots”, says Elba, grew from his experience in South Africa playing Nelson Mandela in the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. For inspiration on how to emulate the man, Elba had looked to his own father, who shared Mandela’s infectious smile and similarly pointed with his middle finger – yet shortly after seeing the movie, his dad died. Elba felt compelled to revisit the country and make an album in his father’s honour – 2014’s Mi Mandela – that featured a song called Tree, “which is sort of on the nose, a love letter to my dad”.Now the two men are working with a cast that includes Alfred Enoch, the young black British actor who went to the US to star alongside Viola Davis in the hit series How to Get Away With Murder. Kwei-Armah smiles: “Alfie came to an early workshop, he got off the plane from Brazil, hadn’t even looked at the script. Thank God, because it was really bad then. I completely rewrote it.”Was the script a collaborative process, too? “We did it together,” Kwei-Armah replies, as Elba points towards Kwei-Armah and stage whispers: “He wrote it.” Not for the first time, they both laugh. Kwei-Armah continues: “Alfie came in, and literally within an hour, our magnificent choreographer, Gregory Maqoma, was holding him upside down.”The immersive nature of Tree has leaked into the rehearsal process, with the creators operating a rehearsal room where people are regularly invited in — including me. During the company’s morning briefing, which involves everyone in the space holding hands in a large circle, Kwei-Armah asks how everyone is. One performer speaks candidly about an encounter that reminded her how grateful she feels to be in the space. Another, Patrice Naiambana, mutters an in-joke under his breath that makes Enoch crack up laughing. Elba tells a story about being confronted by South Africans for playing Mandela despite not being of South African heritage.Earlier, he’d recounted how people had told him he shouldn’t be playing Mandela. “They said, ‘We’ve got actors in South Africa who are qualified.’ And our director was white, and our producer was Indian.”Eventually they won people over. “At the end of the process, people that were on that cusp about whether I should be there or not, were like, ‘Thank you, I can see you just as being a vessel in playing that.’” As with Kaleo, the protagonist in Tree, there was a sense of “coming home. You get what I’m saying?”Kwei-Armah does. “Not only do I get what you’re saying, I wish I had articulated that to the cast on day one. The beautiful thing about the DNA of this, the DNA of our lead character, is going, ‘Whoa, where is my legitimacy here, I’ve got to find my way home.’”But right now they’re just excited to present Tree to the world. “It’s lovely to be able to see something you’ve planted the seed of,” says Elba. “And repot it into a different form”.Kwei-Armah laughs once more: “This is why we’re going to keep working together. We’ve got to keep these garden metaphors going!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5af76842044f5720b37f968a6f160bfb10a68afc/0_286_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a36219b5d1d7fa154d42053c69caf1f","title":"the unwanted the secret windrush files review who could feel proud of britain after this","story":"Theresa May’s hostile environment was a full 70 years in the making, argues this damning, devastating documentaryAs the Empire Windrush made its way from the Caribbean to Britain in 1948, politicians in Westminster were frantically scheming about how they could prevent a ship carrying hundreds of black immigrants from docking in the UK. The Labour prime minister Clement Attlee described it as an “incursion”. A meeting of the government’s economic policy committee discussed whether it might be possible to ert the ship to east Africa, and make its passengers (a well-qualified group of electricians, mechanics, welders and carpenters) take work there, picking peanuts. Eleven Labour MPs delivered a letter to Attlee warning that “an influx of coloured people” would “impair the harmony, strength and cohesion of our public and social life and cause discord and unhappiness among all concerned”.Anyone who thought that the introduction of the hostile environment was one of Theresa May’s few clear, tangible accomplishments will need to reconsider. It turns out that even this unpleasant creation is not something she can claim as her core legacy, since it had already been 70 years in the making.Although the postwar government estimated Britain needed 1.3 million extra workers to help rebuild a country shattered by five years of war, officials turned out to be more welcoming to ex-SS soldiers from Germany than British subjects from the Caribbean. In his powerful film, The Unwanted: the Secret Windrush Files (BBC Two), the historian David Olusoga manages to explain complex immigration law and decode dense documents from the government archives in an arresting way. He pulls out devastating passages from forgotten files to showcase the hostility of successive governments to non-white settlers.Everything begins with the British Nationality Act of 1948, which confirmed the right of all British subjects to move freely and live anywhere they liked within the newly created Commonwealth. But the act, Olusoga argues, was intended to ensure frictionless travel for the large white populations of Canada and Australia. “No one imagined that black and brown people from Asia, Africa and the West Indies would use their rights under this act to come and settle in Britain.”Incriminating archival material reveals the scale of official panic about immigration and the underhand measures taken to discourage residents of Britain’s colonies from settling. Crucially, politicians wanted to restrict access without actually appearing to be racist. The film exposes their shameful contortions as they scrabbled around to justify their prejudices.We learn how ministers in the 1950s commissioned researchers to come up with reasons for concluding that non-white immigration was problematic, with senior civil servants instructing dole officers to conduct secret race surveys to see if there was any truth in the assumption that migrants were coming to live off the welfare state, and asking police chiefs around the country leading questions such as: “Is it true that they are generally idle?”, “Do they have low standards of living?”, and “Are they addicted to drug trafficking and other types of crime?” Winston Churchill was obsessed by the “considerable” number of “coloured workers” employed by the Post Office, and, by 1955, was suggesting to ministers that they should fight the next election on the slogan “Keep England White”.This gradual tightening of immigration legislation exploded in the hands of Theresa May’s government last April, with the Windrush scandal – when thousands of Caribbean-born citizens, legally settled here since childhood, found that they had been silently transformed into illegal immigrants, and threatened with deportation, detained, sacked from their jobs or made homeless.Olusoga shows how the roots of the scandal lie in a single line from the 1971 Immigration Act, which put the onus on iniduals to prove that they are here legally – something so many people were unable to do, with devastating consequences. “Who keeps receipts from the 1970s?” Anthony Bryan asks, explaining how he was detained for five weeks and booked on a flight back to Jamaica. A letter from the Home Office to his lawyer demands more proof: “Your client has stated that he has been resident in the UK since 1965. As such, the evidence submitted must be continuous, and cover the entirety of the 51 years that your client has claimed to reside in the UK.”The most moving parts of this film are the interviews with three Windrush victims (all of whom helped expose the scandal in the ). “It was a country I was proud of, but now I don’t think I feel proud of it,” Sarah O’Connor says, after being wrongly classified as an illegal immigrant, despite her 51 years in the UK. “At times I got so low I wanted my life to end.” Sarah died before the film was finished. No one could feel proud of Britain after watching it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc62777de46c7a280f22b26e5743fdf5da97ec97/0_245_7443_4466/master/7443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a8ec359fdc0f9f3a7800d96885616b7","title":"rylan clark neal i knew i had to be the gay stereotype i played the game","story":"The broadcaster found fame after his hysterical performance on The X Factor, but he has gone from national joke to national treasure – even if celebrity isn’t all it was cracked up to beAt his home in Essex, Rylan Clark-Neal has an assortment of flatscreen TVs all tuned to his current favourite reality TV show. No, not Love Island – BBC Parliament.“It’s such a load of bollocks, I love it!” he says. “Have you ever sat there and watched it on a Wednesday? It’s hil-air-ious ... how prime minister’s question time is not a show on terrestrial TV I have no idea. I’ve never seen more liars in one room!”Channel controllers take note – after all, nobody understands reality TV quite like Clark-Neal. The 30-year-old first came to most people’s attention in 2012 as an outrageously camp contestant on ITV’s The X Factor who couldn’t really sing, but had a talent for annoying the judge Gary Barlow (and charming viewers in the process). A triumphant turn on Channel 5’s Celebrity Big Brother followed, which led to a presenter’s gig on the spin-off show, Big Brother’s Bit on the Side, then a stint as a showbiz reporter on ITV’s This Morning. Having completed a remarkable journey from national joke to national treasure, he can be heard in our front rooms as the stand-in for Zoe Ball’s Saturday afternoon BBC Radio 2 slot. He says he has to pinch himself daily.“Yesterday I went to interview Madonna tonight I’m going to the Spice Girls, because Geri got me a ticket,” he says, by way of explaining his dreams coming true. Or, to put it another way: “Basically, 10-year-old me is having a wank.”Today we are sitting in a quiet meeting room overlooking Regent’s canal in London. Clark-Neal, who admits that he spent the photoshoot grilling the photographer about who would be interviewing him (“I needed to check you weren’t an arsehole”), gleams so brightly that you worry about staring directly at him: not just because of the bright-white veneers, which cost him £25,000 in 2013, but thanks to the brilliant-blue eyes, too. He is funny – outspoken and outrageous. Yet there is a steeliness and seriousness to him (not to mention a sweariness). After years of doing staged showbiz interviews full of made-up anecdotes, there is a sense of catharsis to his conversation: “It’s nice to be honest for a change,” he says, before talking about his early years being bullied, the time off he took at the end of 2017 and the dawning realisation that fame hasn’t turned out to be all he had hoped.Recently, he has turned his attention to another serious matter, one that may surprise those who know him best as the X Factor contestant who had a histrionic meltdown when Nicole Scherzinger told him she was putting him through to the live finals. “I’m obsessed with Brexit,” he says. Then, to prove his political knowledge, he performs an unlikely impression of the Labour MP Dawn Butler telling the Tory front bench to shush (“She’s my favourite she lets the MP mask slip”).So, what is his analysis of the Brexit impasse?“That all roads lead to shit. Every single possible outcome will cause riots. Whatever your position, whatever you voted, even if you get what you want, it’s still gonna be shit.”Could he do a better job?“I often think I could do a better job. Honestly, there are harder decisions to make during a series of Celebrity Big Brother than the ones they’re having to make.”Clark-Neal credits his time in Big Brother with changing the public’s perception of him – “they realised I was normal” – and his adoration goes so deep that he has modelled his house on the set. Apparently, there are Big Brother “eyes” above each door and the garden has been landscaped by people who worked on the show. Sadly, he says: “The only place I’ve ever felt safe is the Big Brother house.” His house even has a diary room for him to sit in. What does he do in there?“Think,” he says. “And talk.”“I can make someone listen if I want to.”“I can set it up so other people in the house can listen ... if I want them to.” He looks slightly bashful. “I live in quite a smart home. I built it from scratch, so I thought of everything ... a lot of my doors are automatic the whole house is voice-activated.”The other day, his wifi went down. He is a little embarrassed to admit that he had forgotten how to turn on the lights like a normal person. “I was pressing random buttons and screaming for Alexa to help.”As if to prove his hi-tech credentials, his watch suddenly starts buzzing to tell him his stepson, Cameron, is trying to call – in 2015, Clark-Neal married Dan Neal, a former police officer and Big Brother contestant, whose 19-year-old son now lives with them. “Do you mind?” he says, reaching for his phone. There follows an amusing conversation revolving around Cameron trying to access the house’s steam room. “If you go for a swim, be careful of the robot – it’s on a cleaning cycle. Oh, and dry the floor after yourself!”How does he find being a stepdad?“It’s the same as being a normal dad. He rinses me dry, I slap him about when he’s naughty ... no, I don’t, obviously … but it’s the same as being a biological dad. He lives with us. I moan at him to clean up, he cleans up ... he cuts the grass, I give him some money ... it’s just very normal.”Clark-Neal describes himself as the man in the middle – there are 10 years between he and both Dan and Cameron – but the closeness in age helps him with some difficult conversations. “I don’t like to talk about sex with Cameron, but I can,” he says. “But I do warn him – if you make me a grandad at 30, I’ll cut it off.”Would he like more children?“It’s not something I really talk about – although it always ends up in the papers anyway. But Dan’s done it all now, whereas I haven’t. So … I don’t know.”Clark-Neal was born Ross Richard Clark in 1988, raised by his mum and his nan in a council house in Stepney Green, east London. He says his childhood was a happy, normal one, but he was bullied: “Of course I was – I was a chubby, ginger, gay kid: all I needed was a set of glasses for the full fucking set.”There was a real community spirit on his street, but his mum moved the family to Essex after he was attacked at a local playground and put in hospital with a fractured skull. “Probably because they thought I was gay, although I don’t remember any of it. One minute I was on the rope swings, the next I was on the floor.”Seeing two women bloodied and beaten in the news recently after an attack on a London bus, alleged to have been motivated by homophobia, didn’t surprise him: “I saw all the statuses saying: ‘I can’t believe this is happening in 2019,’ but every day on my Twitter feed I’ll get: ‘You’re gay, you’re a cunt, people like you should be killed because you’re gay.’ Will things ever change?”In his teens, Clark-Neal dabbled in modelling, changing his name from Ross to Rylan to be more recognisable. He performed in boyband tribute acts, then signed up to The X Factor. But he doesn’t like looking back on that period of his life.“I played a character when I was on there,” he says. “I knew I had to be the gay stereotype that was on the front of the papers every day. And I did my job well. I played the game.”Does this mean that his hysterical crying in front of Scherzinger was all an act?“No, that was true,” he says. “But only because we were drinking in the pool until about 7am and it was 50-degree heat and I’d had an hour’s sleep. I knew I only needed a week on the live shows to earn a bit of money and set myself up for a while. But you only saw a bit of the crying. It went on for 45 minutes and they had to call a paramedic. I couldn’t breathe!”Clark-Neal says he watches the infamous clip once a year, just to remind himself how much it all means. He loves his job and he has worked ridiculously hard for it – possibly too much, at times. He recalls the day his nan died. They were incredibly close, but he still chose to present Big Brother’s Bit on the Side that night. “It was either that or sit indoors crying,” he says. “So I cried, went into work, had another cry, did an hour’s live show, then cried and went home. It’s just how I am ... always at work, never stop.”Does he worry that he is using work to deal with deeper stuff?“One hundred per cent. But I know my nan would have said: ‘Go to work.’”When Clark-Neal first found fame, he lived the celebrity cliches – even buying a customised Range Rover with the silver lettering changed to Range Rylan. But, he says, he misjudged what fame would bring. Even interviewing Madonna, he says he found himself getting mobbed more than the queen of pop. “Not because I’m more recognisable. I’m not under any illusion that I’m an A-lister I don’t think I’m even on the alphabet scale. But I’m in people’s houses every day – I’m there when they wake up and there when they go to bed. So people think they know who I am. And, to a certain extent, they do.”Listen to his show and it is clear why strangers view him as a friend: he is warm, witty and gets his mum to phone in and natter on about ham and cheese toasties. Still, isn’t it a bit rich complaining about fame when he went all-out in search of it?“In the early days, it was all I ever wanted, more than the job,” he says. “I wanted people to know who I was. But now, much as I’m grateful for it, it’s the one thing I wish I didn’t have. Because I don’t leave my house. If I walk down the street, people will come up. And I can’t just go: ‘Get lost,’ because I’m not an arsehole.”He recalls a family wedding the other week – lovely people, great conversation. Then the evening approached. “That’s when it started,” he says. “People who’d been there all day started asking for photos. It’s that constant reminder that: ‘Oh shit, you’re Rylan.’ I’ve lost a lot of friends over it. Especially in telly, I’ve got one handful of people I can cry down the phone to and know it’s between us.”The Range Rylan had to go – too many eagle-eyed drivers started driving alongside him with cameras out, causing him to panic at the wheel. But he blames himself: “I sold my soul,” he says. “I went on X Factor and sold my soul … to the beast.”I wonder how he feels about reality TV in today’s climate, in which The Jeremy Kyle Show has been axed and Love Island heavily criticised after people who had starred in the programmes had mental health problems and even killed themselves. Clark-Neal thinks the main problem is the way fame ends suddenly once you leave the shows. “The second you walk out, you are on your own. I was very lucky. After the X Factor tour, I went back home … it was the first time I’d been in a room on my own for eight months, without anyone watching me. I remember waking up at 4am and thinking: ‘It’s over.’ If the phone hadn’t rung with the Big Brother job a few weeks later, I don’t know what I’d have done.”In fact, he has worked so much that at the end of 2017 he stepped back from his gig on This Morning to look after his mental health. He says he was getting up at 5am most days and not getting home until 2am. He was also struggling to deal with other problems, particularly his mum’s worsening health as a result of Crohn’s disease. Yet the decision drew criticism from some. “I remember seeing tweets from people saying: ‘Who do you think you are? I’ve worked for the NHS for 25 years and I’m not in a position to have time off.’“But then other people will say: ‘I never knew your mum nearly died, or was linked up to an IV drip six nights a week because she can’t digest food any more.’ And that’s because I don’t go on telly and every magazine going: ‘Poor me, my mum’s not well, now give me a tenner for the interview.’“Life is complicated,” he concludes, “but I’ve got a set of veneers that I smile through on morning TV.”After sharing his feelings about always being on duty, I feel guilty when the interview ends and I, too, ask for a favour. But my wife’s grandma, who has been ill, is a huge fan, so … if he wouldn’t mind … could he just do a little video message?“I’d love to,” he says. “What’s her name?”Mildred, I say.“Of course it is.”He whisks my phone from my hand and starts recording: “Hi Mildred, it’s Rylan, I hope you’re well. A little birdie tells me that you listen to my radio show. Thank you, because it’s nice to meet one of the three listeners. I hear you’ve had a few little issues, so I’m sending you all my love. And whenever you want to come to visit Radio 2, let me know.”It is nothing special, really, just a video message for someone he has never met – one of dozens he will no doubt do in the next few days. But it is so effortlessly sweet that I realise why he can’t walk down the street without being approached. And I think: whatever it was he sold to the beast, he definitely kept some of it back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/079826324beb94149e115489da00fe4a61aa43a6/97_0_3843_2307/master/3843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d90e3c9bc63a2495b2aa571ca033aae","title":"tv tonight brian cox explores the mysteries of neptunes rings","story":"The musical professor is on spellbinding and occasionally bewildering form as the series comes to a close.

The plan would cost $2.2tn over the next decade, a figure Sanders proposes to pay through a tax on Wall Street.“This is truly a revolutionary proposal which accomplishes three major goals,” Sanders said in Washington on Monday.“In a highly competitive global economy, it makes certain that all Americans, regardless of income, can get the college education or job training they need to secure decent-paying jobs by making public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free and debt-free.”Sanders was joined in his new effort by congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jayapal, who have introduced parallel legislation in the House.“Free college tuition” was a hallmark of Sanders’ insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton in 2016 and it remains a priority as he faces increasingly tough competition from his closest ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren.Sanders’ plan is decidedly more ambitious than the one introduced by the Massachusetts senator, who has built momentum in the primary race by steadily introducing new policy ideas.Warren’s plan would cancel most student loan debt and also eliminate undergraduate tuition at public colleges and universities. Under the Warren plan, $50,000 in student loan debt would be eliminated for every person with a household income of less than $100,000.The issue of student debt and the cost of college has become central and contested in the Democratic primary, with most leading candidates addressing it in some form. Sanders and Warren have presented by far the most detailed proposals.As the first Democratic debates approach, Warren has closed the gap on Sanders in national and state polling. Former vice-president Joe Biden leads most polls from the ideological center, with Sanders in second and Warren in third as the leading voices of the progressive wing of the party, ahead of the South Bend, Indiana, mayor, Pete Buttigieg, and California senator Kamala Harris.Warren and Sanders will not face each other onstage in this week’s debates in Miami, for which the sprawling Democratic field has been split into two.

Gone are the days when couples would be satisfied with a single black and white photo to commemorate their weddingChinese couples used to be satisfied with a single black and white photograph taken on their wedding as a memento of their special day. But times have changed dramatically, and the wedding photographs, especially pre-wedding photo sessions, have become big business in China.In the main touristic spots in different cities across China, it is easy to see couples having their pre-wedding photoshoots, which become the must-have for every Chinese couple before their marriage. Unlike western weddings, where couples usually have their photos taken on their wedding day, for Chinese people it is quite popular to have their day-long photo sessions way before their actual weddings. Sometimes it can be half a year or even a year in advance of the ceremony.Some couples even choose other countries for their pre-wedding sessions. Often for their photoshoots couples go for traditionally romantic cities such as Paris.Those who can’t afford such a trip to have pre-wedding photos with the Eiffel Tower can have their photo taken in front of Chinese replicas of the main world’s tourist sites.Other couples prefer more traditional outdoor locations, like Beijing’s Hutong neighbourhood, or to be surrounded by nature like in Dali, where lots of couples do their pre-wedding photography next to Lake Erhai.These sessions can range in price from a few hundred up to thousands of dollars, with companies providing clients with everything from outfits to makeup and transportation. Brides typically have at least three dress changes per shoot. Inspired by the traditional western style, many choose a flowing white wedding dress, a Chinese-style red gown, and something more modern.The shoots are just one part of a booming industry in China.

If innovations piloted there are successful, Sidewalk Labs will give the government the option to expand them to a surrounding parcel of 64.2 hectares (158.57 acres).That scope has prompted questions from Waterfront Toronto, an organization formed by Canada’s three levels of government whose stamp of approval Sidewalk Labs needs to move forward. Waterfront Toronto requested for proposals for the land and awarded Sidewalk Labs the chance to develop a plan for it in late 2017.Waterfront Toronto’s board chair, Stephen Diamond, said Sidewalk Lab’s plan is “impressive” but said he was still seeking more information than the plan provides.“The scale and size of the project does raise some serious issues for us,” he said. “We should be looking for support first on Quayside.”Despite Waterfront Toronto’s worries about the plan, Sidewalk Lab’s CEO Dan Doctoroff told the  he is confident he can earn its approval and that of three levels of government, which need to sign off on his proposal for it to become a reality.“My expectation is that we will be able to work through the issues,” he said. “If I didn’t think that then I certainly wouldn’t waste our time moving forward.”If there are objections to the plan, there is room for change, he acknowledged, but said if the project can’t meet goals Sidewalk Labs sets for sustainability, mobility and economic growth then “we are not interested” because “this doesn’t make sense anymore”.He said he was unsurprised by the feedback he has heard so far.“If we really want to create a new path for inclusive, urban growth, you can’t just wave a wand and say it would be nice to do this,” he said. “You really have to think through the problems.”Some of those problems have been raised by Jim Balsillie, a former Blackberry CEO who previously authored scathing editorials about Sidewalk Labs’ intellectual property and data proposals. Balsillie has dismissed Sidewalk Lab’s plan as a “grab for more land, more power and more control” that follows “an ugly 18-month public relations charade that weaponized ambiguity”.“This is not a road map for a smart city, it’s an assault on our democracy,” he wrote in an email to the .The project has long been a lightning rod for criticism, even attracting a petition calling for Waterfront Toronto to head back to reset the process and seek new proposals for the land.The project was already a lightning rod for criticism before Diamond’s remarks.Several high-profile members of a board established to guide the project have resigned, while others have questioned Sidewalk Lab’s hope to earn a fraction of property taxes and development fees in exchange for building a transit line to the neighbourhood and funding underground infrastructure.Critics have also questioned how Sidewalk Labs will capture and use data in the neighbourhood and how intellectual property rights will be handled.Sidewalk Labs has indicated data collected by cameras and sensors throughout the neighbourhood could be used to help create new technologies, develop efficiencies in city planning and aid sustainability efforts.According to the plan released on Monday, the company will use an independent data trust that would set the rules around data use, make it accessible and offer privacy protections. The trust would also ensure Sidewalk Labs does not receive any special status or rights when it comes to data access.Sidewalk Labs also vowed in the plan not to sell personal information, use such info for advertising or disclose the data to third parties without explicit consent.Diamond said Waterfront Toronto would like more information on data collection and use and digital governance and will continue reviewing the plan and seeking public feedback in the coming weeks.The plan will need approval from three levels of government in addition to Waterfront Toronto and construction probably would not start until 2022.Doctoroff said Sidewalk Labs will also spend more time listening to the public and working with government to reach approval. If the project moves ahead, construction probably would not start until 2022."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f47cbc0d0736ad627f9eb63c8153b334188550/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a3455ae3fc57541ed648916adcc1cb5","title":"iran says us sanctions on supreme leader means permanent closure of diplomacy","story":"Foreign ministry spokesman accuses Trump administration of destroying peace and securityIran has said that a US decision to impose sanctions on the country’s supreme leader and other top officials permanently closed the path to diplomacy between Tehran and Washington.“Imposing useless sanctions on Iran’s supreme leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the commander of Iran’s diplomacy (foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif) is the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy,” foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in a tweet on Tuesday.“Trump’s desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security.”US president Donald Trump targeted Khamenei and other top Iranian officials with sanctions on Monday, taking an unprecedented step to increase pressure on Iran after Tehran’s downing of an unmanned American drone.Washington said it would also impose sanctions on Iran’s foreign minister Zarif this week. He negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the US and other major powers, and has spearheaded Iranian diplomacy since. Khamenei is Iran’s utmost authority who has the last say on all state matters.Signing an executive order in the Oval Office, Trump called the increased sanctions “hard-hitting”, saying they would deny the supreme leader, his office and and those closely affiliated with him access to key financial resources.“These measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran’s increasingly provocative actions,” Trump said.“We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country,” the US president added. “I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon.”Standing alongside Trump, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the measures would freeze billions of dollars in Iranian assets.But analysts said their impact on an already heavily-sanctioned country would be limited“The newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Trump said he was willing to pursue dialogue with Tehran without preconditions, but the sanctions appeared to make such talks even less likely.The Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said: “No one in clear mind can have a dialogue with somebody who is threatening you with sanctions as long as that is still there is no way we can have a dialogue.”The ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries comes in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. The Trump administration blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran denied responsibility.Then last week a US drone was shot down by Iran, further escalating the crisis. The US president responded by ordering an attack on Iran, before pulling back and opting for stronger sanctions instead.Tensions with Iran have been mounting since Trump withdrew theUS from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and began applying pressure onTehran through economic sanctions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07ccb514b1021b1ae346cc086a7588579953d714/0_286_5472_3282/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ce51c1bfc283af042c467f04710b054","title":"tuesday briefing nice work if you can get into the right school","story":"Oxbridge continues to dominate high-ranking roles … heatwave hits Europe … and the limits to dirt being ‘good for the immune system’Hello, I’m Warren Murray with the day’s conversation-starters.Luke Heselwood from the Reform thinktank says the “scandalous” figures show that the UK is far from being a meritocracy. “Fixing this will require serious reform to the education system as, despite improvements, the most advantaged are nearly 10 times more likely to attend elite universities than the most disadvantaged.” The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “The old boys’ network and the old school tie still hold back talented and hard-working people from less privileged backgrounds.”Love holding me back, says Johnson – Boris Johnson has set out on a media blitz in which he is vowing never to reveal the events that led to the police being called to the home of his partner Carrie Symonds. The Tory leadership frontrunner insisted on the BBC that “I do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones” because “that is not fair on them”. Johnson is now understood to be rolling out a “media blitz” for the coming days, beginning with a series of closely controlled events on Tuesday. Rival Jeremy Hunt’s camp pointed out that “bottler Boris” has declined all television debates until Conservative members have already begun returning their ballot papers.In a BBC interview, Johnson defended his Brexit plan to renegotiate a deal with the European Union but admitted he could not rip up the entire withdrawal agreement and said he would tackle the Irish border “on the other side of 31 October during what’s called the implementation period”, but then was forced to agree the UK would not get an implementation period without the withdrawal agreement.Sweaty times – It is going to feel like 47C in parts of Europe as an unprecedented week-long heatwave rolls across the continent.

Officials in Paris have set up “cool rooms” in municipal buildings, opened pools for late-night swimming, installed extra drinking fountains and postponed school exams. Temperatures in the French capital reached 34C on Monday and that’s just the start.

Kensington and Chelsea council rejected the scheme. Eilidh Cairns died aged 30 in 2009 after being hit by a tipper truck in the borough. Her sister, Kate Cairns, who founded the road safety charity See Me Save Me after Eilidh’s death said the bike lane scheme, had it been in place, “would surely have prevented the death of my sister”. Eilidh’s mother, Heather, blasted the “effrontery” of the mystery person as she demanded the council identify her: “Someone knows who she is.” The cycle lane plan was drawn up by the office of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan.

But it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society. The left, in short, has not had an economic policy to answer that of the right: privatisation, deregulation, lower taxes for business and the rich, more power for employers and shareholders, less power for workers.Capitalism has been made to appear inevitable, and any alternative impossible. But in recent years the prevailing system has started to fail. Rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity, it has produced wage stagnation, ever more workers in poverty, ever more inequality, banking crises, populism and the climate crisis. Even some rightwing politicians concede the seriousness of the crisis. A huge political space has opened up, and a transatlantic movement of leftwing economists is building a practical alternative to neoliberalism. The result, the new economists claim, will be a “democratic economy” that suits society, rather than a society subordinated to the economy.Fifa is holding a priority investigation, to be concluded within 48 hours, into the behaviour of the Cameroon team during their 3-0 loss to England in the last 16 of the Women’s World Cup.

Once the issue became known, the hospital stopped the tests, seized the equipment and informed the patients.  Women who underwent gynaecological “exploratory work” without their consent at St Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny, are being contacted by the hospital group about the incident.Ireland East Hospital Group is in the process of contacting the five women in relation to the incident, which happened nine months ago. The women are being told they will be briefed on the contents of a report into the matter before it is published.Minister for Health Simon Harris said on Monday evening that his officials have sought assurances from the hospital group that the women’s care needs are being met.“The Department of Health has been advised by the HSE of a review of hysteroscopy procedures in St Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny. The HSE has stated that the review and its recommendations are being considered by the Ireland East Hospital Group. It is important to await the outcome of this process and the Department is engaging with the HSE in this regard,” he said. Appealing for the privacy of those involved to be respected, Mr Harris said his immediate concern was for the patients involved. ‘Open disclosure’“The HSE has advised that open disclosure has taken place with all patients involved.”The hospital group says it received the report by gynaecologists Prof Donal Brennan of UCD and Dr William Boyd of the Mater Hospital late last week.Prof Ray O’Sullivan, the obstetrician at St Luke’s who carried out the tests, has said he did not feel he needed to obtain consent beforehand. The hospital maintains he should have obtained consent, has sought his suspension and has reported the matter to the Medical Council. The tests were stopped last September after nursing staff raised concerns over whether the required consents had been obtained from a hospital ethics committee and from the patients themselves.The tests involved flushing the vaginas of the women with water, inserting a miniature scope for monitoring and measuring the pressure within the vagina. The equipment involved, including tubes and pressure gauges, was brought in from outside the hospital.Speaking to The  on Sunday, Prof O’Sullivan said the issue “had more to do with preliminary, exploratory work – as to whether you need consent for that before you engage in an actual clinical trial. It was more technical than anything else”.Asked if he felt he needed consent, he replied: “I felt I didn’t need consent. I didn’t because we weren’t actually doing the research. We were just seeing if a particular procedure that we were planning on doing as part of the research could be done”.Stopped the testsOnce the issue became known, the hospital stopped the tests, seized the equipment and informed the patients, who were told investigations into the matter would be completed within weeks.Prof O’Sullivan stressed that no patients were harmed, adding “they didn’t even know it’s been done”. “You can’t innovate within the HSE without having to mind your Ps and Qs,” he said.In a statement, the Ireland East Hospital Group said its chief executive had commissioned a review of “a research study undertaken in Kilkenny Hospital on the hysteroscopy procedure”. It said the chief executive was carefully considering the review’s findings and any recommendations or actions arising from it would be implemented fully “having regard for due process”. “Arising from the media coverage of the issue today, IEHG contacted the patients comprehended by the study today to share the findings and to provide information and reassurance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Referees\u0026rsquo society condemns \u0026lsquoepidemic\u0026rsquo of poor treatment of match officialsIrish businessman claims he is a non-resident as he is based in MaltaPatients to be briefed on contents of report before it is publishedDeath of two pregnant patients prompted outside investigations into St Luke\u0026rsquos Hospital, KilkennyEntire Killarney system backed up last year causing sewage to flow into a local riverCompany to tell TDs it can do rollout much cheaper than \u0026euro5bn National Broadband PlanProf Kinsella will suggest the introduction of new \u0026ldquofiscal stress tests in order to better prepare for a downturnHeavy rain to be replaced by sunshine this week, with temperatures to reach up to 27 degreesDutch cycling expert measured air pollution in Dublin at three times Utrecht levelDisabled parking bay is the first of four planned spots, with two more due to open before SeptemberNo major complaints from teachers about Monday\u0026rsquos examsGovernment facing budget deficit if UK crashes out of EUTrio who were working as gamekeepers convicted over animal\u0026rsquos death in Co WaterfordTributes paid to \u0026lsquoleading light\u0026rsquo in Irish motorsportUK to crash out of EU in October, predicts Douglas CarswellWomen\u0026rsquos council calls for State survey into sexual violence to include analysis of dating appsBord Plean\u0026aacutela says proposed 222 units would fail to provide acceptable living environmentMark Menezes says Ireland should switch to liquified natural gas (LNG) and nuclear"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936296.1561408437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"donohoe to table tight budget as cash set aside for no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe: there will be limited room on budget day for any additional spending or tax measures beyond those already signalled. Photograph: PA   A no-deal Brexit would push the Government towards running an overall budget deficit next year as opposed to a small surplus if the UK leaves the EU in an orderly fashion.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will outline the consequences of a no-deal Brexit on the State finances alongside forecasts in the case of Britain leaving the EU with a deal when he publishes the summer economic statement on Tuesday, one of the initial steps in the annual budget process.Government sources said a no-deal Brexit will turn an expected surplus into a deficit in the “range” of “up to” 1.5 per cent for next year.It is expected there will be roughly €2.8 billion in extra money to spend in the budget, of which some €2 billion-€2.2 billion has already been committed in capital spending, public sector pay rises and demographic changes.This means there will be limited room on budget day for any additional spending or tax measures beyond those already signalled.The budget will be delivered on October 8th and the UK is due to leave the EU on October 31st. It is also before a possibly crucial EU summit on October 17th and 18th, which may decide on the Brexit issue.While Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to make a decision in September on whether a deal or a no-deal exit is more likely, the budget will be framed to fit both outcomes.Too generousThe Government want to avoid introducing measures that are too generous and would have to be rescinded if Britain crashes out of the bloc.The other scenario Mr Donohoe is said to be keen to avoid is having a second budget, which is seen as sending a signal of uncertainty. The intention is to table a tight budget that would leave money for increased supports in sectors such as agriculture if there is a no-deal Brexit.Michael McGrath, the Fianna Fáil finance spokesman, who will negotiate the budget with Mr Donohoe, said there was a need to “hold some resources in reserve” and that a “cautious approach” was needed.He said a no-deal Brexit would require “targeted intervention to support certain sectors of the economy that are most exposed”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936275.1561411055!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eir says it can install rural broadband for less than 1bn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCarolan Lennon, the company’s chief executive, will tell the Oireachtas communications committee that “it is clear to us that we can build rural fibre infrastructure at a lower cost than is currently envisaged in the plans”.

Carolan Lennon, the company’s chief executive, will tell the Oireachtas communications committee that “it is clear to us that we can build rural fibre infrastructure at a lower cost than is currently envisaged in the plans”.“Eir could complete the NBP, based on Eir’s approach to the 300k rural rollout, for under €1 billion,” she will tell the committee, which is holding a series of hearings into the plan to connect some 540,000 rural properties to high-speed internet. The 300k reference is to eir’s current project which aims to make broadband available to more than 300,000 rural homes on a commercial basis. She will also say in her statement that the removal of these 300,000 premises “should have led to a reduction in the overall subsidy” for the National Broadband Plan.Despite reservations among senior civil servants about the affordability, the Cabinet last month approved the plan, which, when private investment is included, is expected to cost some €5 billion. The State is investing up to €3 billion in the plan. Successful bidderMs Lennon will also question whether the gap funding model used by the Department of Communications to deliver the plan is appropriate. This model will see the successful bidder for the contract, a consortium led by Granahan McCourt, rather than the State take ownership of the network at the end of the process. She will say that the model “failed to deliver a competitive outcome” for the procurement process and that “this need not have been the case had different choices been made along the way”. Other models could have delivered broadband “faster and cheaper than the existing process”, Ms Lennon will say. Eir withdrew as a bidder for the contract in January of last year citing “significant commercial issues and a complexity within the tender process”. ‘Driven up costs’Committee members will be told that Granahan McCourt has decided not to use the infrastructure eir built for its 300k plan but to “duplicate” work it has already done which she says “has driven up the costs and associated subsidy”. Ms Lennon will tell the committee that after eir withdrew from the process, its then chief executive Richard Moat wrote to then minister for communications Denis Naughten “outlining our reasons for leaving the process but also offering to discuss with the department alternative ways of achieving the Government’s stated policy objectives”. In a statement in response to Ms Carolan’s comments, a Department of Communications spokeswoman said: “There were two draft bids received in September 2017 at an advanced stage in the NBP procurement process - one from Eir and one from National Broadband Ireland (who were appointed preferred bidder). Both bids were broadly similar in terms of the level of State subsidy sought, with Eir’s bid coming in as multiples of €1 billion.” "},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"New measures from Washington target Iran\u0026rsquos supreme leader and other top officialsMany foreigners among 55,000 captured Islamic State fighters and their families detainedPalestinians boycotting event, while Israelis not invitedTurkey\u0026rsquos ruling party concedes defeat in vote that will have major repercussionsMove after US aviation agency issues order following shooting-down of US drone in regionPresident condemns downing of aircraft but says it may not have been intentional\u0026lsquoJoints will be separated, it will not be a problem,\u0026rsquo journalist\u0026rsquos killers were assured\u0026lsquoBaseless allegations\u0026rsquo: Saudi official rejects report by rights investigator as \u0026lsquonothing new\u0026rsquoDeath of ousted former president likely to increase pressure on Cairo over human rights recordWhite House calls move \u0026lsquonuclear blackmail\u0026rsquo as 2015 deal in danger of total collapseWife of Israeli prime minister is fined more than $15,000 under plea bargainNetanyahu praises US president as he unveils Golan Heights community named in his honourCrown prince calls for \u0026lsquodecisive stand\u0026rsquo from international community, but says kingdom does not want warUK joins Trump in blaming Iran for explosions that damaged two vessels carrying oilIran\u0026rsquos leadership denies involvement in attacks on Norwegian and Japanese tankersMoves follow attack by Israeli aircraft on Hamas military sitesUS releases video purportedly showing Iranian forces taking mine from tanker\u0026rsquos sideBritain backs Washington\u0026rsquos stance as incidents increase tensions in the Middle EastJapan\u0026rsquos prime minister to meet Iranian leaders two weeks after talks with Donald TrumpMurtaja Qureiris, now 18, was arrested aged 13 for role in protests and has been in jail since"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936812.1561443820!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"iran says us sanctions mean permanent closure of diplomacy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump signs with vice-President Mike Pence (right) and secretary of treasury Steven Mnuchin at the White House on June 24th, 2019, ‘hard-hitting sanctions’ on Iran’s supreme leader. Photograph: Mandel NganAFPGetty ImagesThe new US sanctions targeting Iran’s supreme leader and other top officials mean the “permanent closure” of diplomacy between Tehran and Washington, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman has said.That is according to a report carried by the state-run IRNA news agency on Tuesday, quoting spokesman Abbas Mousavi.Mr Mousavi says the “fruitless sanction on Iran’s leadership and the chief of Iranian diplomacy mean the permanent closure of the road of diplomacy with the frustrated US administration”.US president Donald Trump enacted new sanctions on Monday targeting Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. US officials also say they are planning sanctions against Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.Washington says the measures were taken to discourage Tehran from developing nuclear weapons and supporting militant groups.They came amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US over Tehran’s unravelling nuclear deal with world powers.Mr Mousavi’s statement echoed that of Iran’s UN ambassador, Majid Takht Ravanchi, who warned on Monday that the situation in the Persian Gulf was “very dangerous” and that any talks with the US were impossible in the face of escalating sanctions and intimidation.Meanwhile, the US envoy at the United Nations, Jonathan Cohen, said the Trump administration’s aim was to get Tehran back to negotiations.The sanctions follow Iran’s downing last week of a US surveillance drone, worth over 100 million US dollars (€87.7 million), over the Strait of Hormuz, an attack that sharply escalated the crisis in the Persian Gulf.After the downing of the drone, Mr Trump pulled back from the brink of retaliatory military strikes but continued his pressure campaign against Iran.Mr Trump last year re-imposed sanction on Iran after pulling the US out of the nuclear pact that world powers made with Tehran in 2015.Other nations stayed in the deal, which eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbing its nuclear programme.The latest round of sanctions denies Mr Khamenei and senior Iranian military figures access to financial resources and blocks their access to any financial assets they have under US jurisdiction.Mr Trump said the new sanctions were not only in response to the downing of the American drone.The US has blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tankers this month near the Strait of Hormuz. Citing those episodes and intelligence about other Iranian threats, the US has sent an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf region and deployed additional troops alongside the tens of thousands already there.The sanctions were announced as US secretary of state Mike Pompeo was holding talks in the Middle East with officials in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia about building a broad, global coalition that includes Asian and European countries to counter Iran.Mr Pompeo is likely to face a tough sell in Europe and Asia, particularly from those nations still committed to the 2015 nuclear deal.–APRead more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Ministry of JusticeIran says sanctions on supreme leader mark \u0026#39permanent closure\u0026#39 of diplomatic solutionBoris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedTory leadership latest: Boris Johnson stresses right to privacy and defends Brexit planComment: The Special Relationship has never mattered more.

Wangige is hardly Helmand, nor, by his own admission, did counterinsurgency work particularly well in either Afghanistan or Iraq.Ex-major Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 46, served in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq before founding 4G in 2013 in KenyaYet the traditional “microfinance” model of lending to the poor was not working either, Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckoned. Once a buzzword in development circles, microfinance has been hailed by its proponents as a powerful tool in fighting poverty. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were both fans.The idea was simple enough. Many poor people in the developing world eke out a living as petty traders, but rarely have access to the credit needed to grow their businesses.Microfinance was meant to give them that access through  small loans and low-cost banking services, setting them on the path to self-sufficiency. The model has gone global in recent decades: more than 200m people round the world have been the recipients of “microcredit”.The miracle has largely failed to happen, however. While disagreements about the impact of microfinance abound, studies have suggested that the model has largely failed to lift the poor out of poverty. Many, indeed, have been left worse off because they have been plunged into debt.Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckons the problem largely lies with the model used by most microfinanciers. To keep overheads down, many companies lend through mobile phone apps and have little interaction with their clients or knowledge of what the money is going to be spent on.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett at a market in WangigeOften cash is borrowed to cover unexpected crises, such as funerals and medical operations. Reflecting a growing problem in Kenya, loans to cover online gambling are also increasing, according to government officials.Lacking a sufficient or regular enough income to pay back the loans, many default. More than one million people have been blacklisted by the country’s two main credit ratings, sometimes over loans of less than £5.Credit alone, Mr Hennessy-Barrett realised, was likely to do more harm than good. Only if people borrowed sensibly, and understood how to turn loans into larger incomes, would they have a chance of escaping poverty rather than being sucked deeper into it.“Just shoving money at people is not enough,” he said. “Having a loan to solve a problem is not enough. What you need is a livelihood where you can use credit for leverage. When it it just to live it is a recipe for poverty.“Cheap debt pushed carelessly at poor people keeps poor people poor.”Valentine Nasila, Operations Manager at 4G Capital\u0026#39s head office, speaks with a clientThere was no question in his mind that microcredit was still the key to fighting poverty. In a country where formal jobs are few and far between, three in four working Kenyans are self-employed, scratching a living by selling goods to other poor people.Yet if poor borrowers were to have a chance of success, he concluded, they would need much more face-to-face support from trained professionals who understood the needs and challenges of their clients.It was in attempting to meet this need that Mr Hennessy-Barrett drew on his army experience. In Afghanistan, the British army’s counterinsurgency operations were designed to deny insurgents ground by protecting communities, creating the conditions to let them live normal lives and speaking to people to understand their needs and reassure them.Such skills could also be deployed in peacetime environments, he felt. From the time of its foundation in a small office in Wangige in 2013, his company, 4G Capital, would run along army lines.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett\u0026#39s business is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies“In Afghanistan we had several teams of elite soldiers operating in multiple places, communing with the population, trying to understand their needs,” he said.“That led to a methodology of having small teams of well-trained, dedicated professionals.”From the outset, Mr Hennessy-Barrett deployed his staff in teams of four and sent them to trawl through the markets using his own interpretation of the army’s “patrol trinity”.In counterinsurgency terms, this meant “intelligence gathering”, “framework protection” and “local assurance”. For 4G, this was reinterpreted as “marketing”, “lending” and “growth and repayment”. Teams would seek to understand the environment they were operating in, lend to iniduals after learning what their needs were and finally helping them to grow their businesses so they could repay their loans.The loans on offer were small, between £40 and £400, and had to be repaid within a month, the intention being to enforce discipline and focus money where it was needed: replenishing inventory, adding stock and growing businesses.Crucially, it also came with basic training, teaching clients how to maximise growth potential, keep books and improve customer care. The mixture of personal attention and computer algorithms to assess the viability of clients’ growth potential means that 92 percent of loans are paid on time, meaning the company has more money to lend.The model appears to have been phenomenally successful. From its original outlet in Wangige, 4G Capital now has 70 more, with more than 300 employees. Expanding into Rwanda and Uganda, it is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies. It expects to lend £47 million over the next 12 months.Optometrist Tabitha Njeri, 26, borrowed £80 from 4G Capital to start her own optician\u0026#39s storeThe success, Mr Hennessy-Barrett says, has come from “slaving” the company’s fortunes to the fortunes of its clients. It is doing well because its clients have seen their businesses grow on average by 82 per cent since taking their first loan from 4G.Tabitha Njeri, who runs a small optician’s shop in Wangige, is one such beneficiary. 4G lent her £80 towards her startup costs early last year, gave her training in accountancy and business growth skills and rolled over loans to allow her to increase stock from 50 to 150 glasses. She now plans to expand by opening a diagnosis lab.“I used to find it very difficult to raise enough to support my family,” she said. “Now I can. I have financial stability.”Down the road, Patrick Ngore, who runs a chemist’s, says he has been able to increase stock sevenfold with loans from the company. He also credits training in stock management and minimising expenditure in growing his profit margins from 20 to 40 per cent.Others in Wangige tell similar stories.In many ways, the 4G model, although partially reliant on technology,  is a return to the basics of microfinance. Loans have allowed Patrick Ngore, owner of a chemists,to increase his stock sevenfold and boost his profit margin from 20 per cent to 40 per centThe founder of modern microfinance is generally held to be Mohammed Yunus, who started making small loans to the very poor in Bangladesh in 1976. Lending mostly to women, who formed small groups that were collectively responsible for each other’s debts, he found that astonishingly few defaulted.His Grameen Bank has now made more than £7 billion pounds in small loans to the poor, an achievement that secured him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.Yet the microfinance model he pioneered would grow increasingly troubled. Irresponsible and often predatory lending to the poor led to debt crises in Bosnia, Morocco and parts of Pakistan. It also contributed to a debtors’ revolt in Nicaragua in 2008 when farmers, backed by President Daniel Ortega, refused en masse to pay back microcredit loans. A microfinance default crisis in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh two years later was blamed for a surge in suicide by farmers.Geoffrey Kamanu runs through a finance training programme with staff from 4G Capital The longstanding problem with microfinance, which is largely driven by private companies like 4G, is that business logic often leads to aggressive tactics in collecting debts, says David Roodman, author of the book Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance.In countries like Kenya many microfinance outfits lend at interest rates as high as 30 per cent because they are forced to raise capital from commercial banks, often placing an intolerable burden on poor borrowers.Mr Hennessy-Barrett says his model is addressing those concerns: interest rates are capped at 13.5 per cent and allowances are made for “bad-luck customers” who encounter unexpected setbacks like illness or a death in the family.Experts in Kenya generally applaud 4G Capital’s model, which has been mimicked by one or two other outfits. But they also raise questions about what impact it can really have.Microcredit | Transforming fortunes and futures in NepalDespite its growth, 4G and its 120,000 customers are still pretty small fry, says Paul Musoke, director of financial institutions at FSD Africa, a UK-funded organisation that looks at ways to financially empower the poor.By contrast, M-Shwari and Tala, two providers of small loans through mobile phone apps, have 11 million between them in Kenya alone. Such “light-touch” models, which use technology rather than people to engage with borrowers are always likely to do better than “heavy-touch” approaches like Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s — except in densely populated countries like Bangladesh.“It makes sense what he is trying to do,” says Mr Musoke. “The question is whether it can be scaled up significantly to make an impact.”The other danger in Kenya is that a microfinance “debt bubble” risks being created because, in a poorly regulated market, there is little to stop poor borrowers from taking loans from 4G and other companies offering unsecured credit at the same time.Microfinancing: revolutionising the health and livelihoods of Nepalese women“The greatest potential for harm has come when you have multiple lenders all growing at once because then almost certainly people are borrowing from one to pay the other,” says Mr Roodman.Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s model seems enlightened, yet it is too soon to tell how effective it will be. History suggests that microcredit often stimulates start-up businesses, but ultimately fails to enrich its owners, becoming more a tool helping to manage poverty than to reduce it.

You mean I can no longer bring a six pack of Belgian beer back home in my bag after a trip to Brussels? Is there a way to convince them to change?Maurits Wever said: That\u0027s a pity. We\u0027re going on holiday to the Scottish islands of Arran and Islay. We wanted to buy some local whiskies, but these aren\u0027t allowed on @Eurostar.Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of Seat61, said Eurostar has quietly changed its luggage policy after previously having a fairly easygoing attitude to alcohol which saw only disruptive passengers and those travelling to ski destinations affected.He claimed it will be completely unnecessary to enforce the new measures on all trains.Eurostar has been around for over 20 years, he said. Why is (carrying alcohol) now a problem? I don\u0027t believe society has changed that much.There\u0027s an awful lot of people who are a bit shocked that they could be caught out. They\u0027re shocked that they won\u0027t be able to bring back a couple of bottles of nice wine from Paris or some fascinating Belgian beers from Brussels.He added: It\u0027s going to be inconvenient for a lot of passengers. It might not affect businessmen travelling first class who get (served) wine anyway, but it\u0027s going to be a pain in the neck.I think air travel is a bit of a pain in the neck a lot of the time and we need a bit of respite.A spokesman for Eurostar said its luggage policy was updated last autumn to maintain a pleasant environment on board for all our travellers.Passengers who want to transport prohibited alcohol are advised to use the firm\u0027s luggage service, which charges a minimum fee of £30 per item.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

At that time I cooperated with our common friend jeweler Jacob Arabo. After the event, we went for dinner, where I met a man, and he introduced himself as the king of Malaysia,” she wrote. “I took it as a joke and joked back that I was also the queen of Moscow. We talked all evening and exchanged phone numbers.”According to Russian media reports, the couple tied the knot at a lavish ceremony at the Barvikha concert hall in Moscow.Instagram photos show the bride in an elegant wedding dress decorated with delicate lace flowers, while the groom is clad in royal blue national robes. Earlier this year, the Malaysian press reported tensions between the palace and the government. Malaysia has nine royal households, who take turns to sit on the throne. King Mohammad V, who began his reign in December 2016, was expected to rule until December 2021.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

He was a lifelong “better off outer”, they said, who tempered his views during the referendum but then prevented Labour from opposing Brexit – thus ceding ground and millions of votes to the Liberal Democrats, Greens and nationalists. This is probably too simple. It seems more likely that Corbyn was always most interested in gaining power, but had a different view of the right way to go about it. Immediately after the referendum, for example, most Labour people thought it was right to accept the result and to press for a soft Brexit. And in the 2017 election, Labour’s policy of a “jobs-first Brexit”, combined with opposition to a no-deal exit, was no obstacle to a stunning electoral performance that deprived Theresa May of her majority.It was only last year – when The Independent started to campaign for a Final Say referendum – that Corbyn’s attempt to straddle Leave and Remain started to cause strains in the party. Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Steph Houghton celebrates with teammates after scoring England\u0027s first goal during the Women\u0027s World Cup round of 16 match against Cameroon at the Stade du Hainaut stadium in Valenciennes, FrancePride marchers at a rally outside the Scottish Parliament in EdinburghThe sun rises between the stones and over crowds at Stonehenge where people gather to celebrate the dawn of the longest day in the UK.

Labour did badly in the European elections, and yet managed to hold Peterborough in the by-election against a strong Brexit Party challenge. The New Statesman reports that one analysis prepared for the shadow cabinet suggested that Labour is losing votes in a 2:1:1 ratio to the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Brexit Party. In other words, for every one it loses to the Brexit Party, it loses three to the Remain parties. This suggests that Labour should take up a more explicitly Remain position – which is what Corbyn is now cautiously doing, although his Remainer critics will say it is too little, too late, and still allows the Lib Dems and the Greens to outflank the party on the pro-EU side. But Corbyn’s Leaver critics – the 26 MPs who signed a letter to him today opposing a new referendum – say that he risks the worst of both worlds: losing Leave voters on one side while failing to win Remain voters back on the other. This split is represented at the top of the party, with Ian Lavery, the party chair, posting an angry tweet this morning – which was presumably meant to be a private message – saying that the position of the shadow cabinet supporters of a referendum “really is to head for revoking Article 50”. On the other side, Emily Thornberry’s public support for a referendum exceeded the bounds of party policy, prompting Corbyn to demote her from her role deputising for him in the Commons (sending her to “re-education camp”, as the prime minister put it). She continued to press her case at the shadow cabinet meeting today. What is interesting is that Keir Starmer, assumed to be the leading organiser of Labour’s shift of position, has been less outspoken. Yet he has been drafting and redrafting the words of the policy as it has gradually evolved. The most important force behind the shift has been the views of party members. They are overwhelmingly in favour of a referendum, and of staying in the EU. They were fended off with a complicated policy at the party’s annual conference last year – the compromise once again drafted by Starmer. And the pressure from many of the trade unions – not including Unite, led by Corbyn’s ally Len McCluskey – has added to the feeling that the line could not be held.  In the end, the decisive voice will probably be that of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. He has consistently struck a tone more favourable to a second referendum than Corbyn’s, and he spoke at today’s shadow cabinet to say that opposition from members to the existing policy had become so great that it was time to change the party’s position. Despite briefing from the party’s spokespeople that Corbyn’s words to the shadow cabinet do not represent a change in policy, it seems there is no doubt that a policy shift is now under way.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I just stay inside.”Police in Wavertree recorded  crimes in April alone - with anti-social behaviour and violence topping the list.The show’s cameras caught large groups of youths outside the house on Mischief night, drinking, shouting and wheeling each other up and down the street in stolen supermarket trollies.The couple hear fights outside their front door and they live in fear of stones and bricks coming through their window.“There are a lot of bricks lying around - and the fact that we have made such an effort on our house is asking for trouble,” says Mel.“When we got this house we wanted to do it because we wanted an easy le and we didn’t want to be worrying about mortgages... but I didn’t want to be worrying about my windows getting smashed either.“I don’t want to leave my house and be panicking that my house is getting ransacked.”Marauding teenagers aren’t the only unwelcome visitors to the street, either.“In the past we’ve had problems with a woman who was using the street as a toilet - and I saw her again last night,” says Mel.“She got quite aggressive with me and physically got hold of me, and I thought: ‘What have I got myself into here ’“This is not what I want to be doing: sitting down eating my dinner and someone pulls their pants down... and we can see them out of the window.”Inside their four walls, Mel and Rob’s home is beautul, with clean bright rooms, a spacious kitchen, cosy living room and modern tiled bathroom.“It’s definitely our dream home,” says Mel. “We don’t have a social le but we don’t feel we’re missing it because we love being here.“It’s so special because we did it all ourselves so it makes us proud.”But outside their door, lies a “ghost street”, lined with derelict houses boarded up with metal shutters.“I feel like we’ve been forgotten about,” says Mel. “I come out of my front door and my view is unoccupied houses and they’re falling into more and more disrepair.

If it is appropriate for us to use it, we will use it.Dramatic footage released last November showed Scotland Yard’s Scorpion pursuit teams hitting mopeds and sending suspects sprawling over car bonnets and flying across the tarmac.However, under existing laws, cops chasing moped thugs are subject to the same legal test for careless and dangerous driving offences as members of the public.Eventhey escape prosecution, cops can be investigated for gross misconduct and sacked.Cops who face charges often have to wait years before having their names cleared.The Home Office has insisted it is “reviewing” the law to give officers greater protection but critics said they must push through new legislation as a priorityThe documentary also interviews members of moped gangs who commit crimes and vigilantes who risk their lives to hunt the yobs.Scotland Yard introduced the bold new tactic of ramming moped thieves to widespread acclaim after violent gangs wreaked havoc on the streets of Lawless London in a terrying crime epidemic.The growth of moped crime - in which some criminals have stolen up to  phones in an hour - has exploded by , per cent across the UK in the past three years.And Lawless London has seen the highest spike in moped muggings, where over , separate offences were recorded last year alone.Victims are often targeted as theyre coming out of tube stations and other transport hubs where theyre more vulnerable to attacks.Thieves snatch handbags, watches and other expensive items before making an easy getaway.Cops had been criticised due to a widespread belief that they werent allowed to pursue a suspect on a mopedthey werent wearing a helmet.But proposed changes in the law make it explicit that specially trained police drivers can chase a rider without a helmet.Forces have previously unveiled other tactics to fight moped crime, like automatic tyre deflation devices and DNA tagging spray.And the tactics appear to be working - while there were , offences of moped crime in London between January and October last year, the same period has seen , offences this year - a reduction of  per cent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fexofenadineis a fantastic antihistamine that is only available on prescription. In my experience is one of the most effective around.And whilst some antihistamines are marketed as non-drowsy, some iniduals are particularly sensitive, and will still find themselves experiencing some fatigue.Some lesser known side effects include a dry mouth throat, dry eyes and blurred vision.Medications that block histamine receptors help allergic conditions, but these types of medications can reduce mucous and aqueous production, which cause dry eye and mouth complaints.Adding eye drops to your regime can be really useful to help combat the itchy eyes.Nasal decongestants are often combined with anticholinergic medications which together contribute to dry eyes, dilated pupils and decreased response to bright light.The dilated pupils interfere with your ability to focus on objects and can, therefore, contribute to blurry vision.Boots pharmacist Natalie Masters said: “You may have seen reports on rising pollen counts this weekend.If you’re a hayfever sufferer, don’t panic. When there’s more pollen in the air, your symptoms may worsen, but there are lots of steps you can take to alleviate these.Prevention is key, which means avoiding coming into contact with pollen in the first place.Grassy areas are often best avoided andyou can, don’t spend time outdoors at the times when pollen counts are highest, typically the early morning and late afternoon and evening.If you need to go outside, applying a petroleum jelly balm to the inside of your nostrils or using an allergy barrier nasal spray can help prevent pollen from entering your nostrils, whilst larger wraparound sunglasses can help stop pollen from irritating your eyes.There’s also several products you can purchase which can help to alleviate your symptoms when they start flaring up.Speak to your pharmacist about anti-histamine tablets, hayfever eye drops or a suitable steroid nasal spray.If you’ve been outdoors when the pollen count is high, make sure to shower and wash your hair once you get home to wash away any stray pollen particles.Regularly vacuuming and dusting your house with a damp cloth and washing and drying your clothes indoors may also help to keep your home a pollen-free zone.Importantly, try not to be worried or stressed about your hayfever. It has been claimed that hayfever can be exacerbated by this, so try to keep calm and consider dferent products and methods – hopefully you’ll soon find what works best for you.”Boots is currently has their own brand hay fever products on offer for  for £, including Boots One-A-Day Allergy Relief mg tabletsand  Boots Hayfever Relief for Adults  micrograms dose Nasal Spray  Metered Sprays .Branded products are also on offer at two for £.Nasal Sprays are particularly helpful for the rhinitisor blocked nose symptoms, which antihistamine tablets may not always take care of. Beconase is always a good start, but mometasoneor Fluticasone based sprays such as Avamys and Dymista, can provide that next step for relief.But in some iniduals, nasal sprays can cause some localised irritation within the nostrils, and even nose bleeds.The most important thing about nasal sprays is ensuring you are using them correctly. It is worth noting that they do not work immediately, and their effects are cumulative, meaning the longer you use them, the better the response – so you’ll need patience before you see results.Prolonged use of over the counter decongestant nasal sprays can create a rebound rhinosinusitisused for too long – in essence, they can make symptoms worseused for more than  or  days.What should you do should you experience any of these symptoms Dr Fenton says thatyou experience any of these side effects, its important to discuss them with your GP.He said: There is a multitude of alternative antihistamines, spray and drops that may be more suited to you.Alternatives include using medications used for asthma, such as Montelukast, which is excellent for the runny nose component of hay fever.In addition, some well-known antacidsdespite mainly being used for acid reflux and heartburn, can actually have great antihistamine effects.When all  fails, you may consider the hay fever injection, which is a steroid-based injection. This is not to be taken lightly, as is not without risks, but it can be beneficial to those with sever hay fever.Dr Fenton added: The truth behind hay fever treatment is that it can be trial and error.You have to take the time to find the right combination of treatments for you.Speaking to your GP is useful, as they will take you through all of the options and recommend, prescribe and administer the correct hay fever medications as needed."},{"url":null,"title":"sunny beach nightclub bulgaria holiday","story":"Den Glade Viking is one of the many party bars at the Sunny Beach resort - a huge party town by the Black Sea where young Brits flock for the summer.In pictures taken at the bars many events and parties, ladies and gents can be seen frolicking together and dancing scantily-clad on top of the bar.Speaking to the Daily Star, a spokesperson for the raunchy club said that dancing naked on the bar was encouraged.He said: Anyone can dance naked on bars.Our slogan is the only place where it’s allowed to dance naked on the bar’.Events at Den Glade Viking include the UV party - where teens draw rude images on each other with brightly coloured pens.The bars spokesperson added: “There’s tonnes of mischievous sex games going on during the beach parties and Full Moon Parties.“Your typical - crowd games.”After her visit, Shannon Currie, from Wigan in Greater Manchester, left a positive review on the bars Facebook page and said its the only place that allows a naked dance on the bar.She added: I cant wait to be back.Other young Brits on Facebook have raved about the party bar too, calling it the best place to party in Sunny Beach and saying they had some of the best nights of their le there.The bar is part of a pub crawl run by workers at the resort.Den Glade Viking is one of a few stops that offer free drinks and shots to young people who come along for the party.The nightclub has a pool that is frequented by hardcore party-goers during the day.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need another show with a big house and a strong, silent, topless gardener who gallops around searching for love, fulfilment and all that toss.”So we’ve now got this six-part series fronted by Tom Bateman, who actually made a promising start to playing soldier-turned-trader John Beecham.He got shot.I’d have run the closing titles right there and then and promised viewers: “ITV willin about , when it’s got some new ideas.”According to the caption, however, “three years later” John Beecham was back and he’d brought his extended family with him to fill the big house.They include: His dear old racist mum, played by Mrs Patmore off Downton, a motherless baby, wayward brother Daniel, some pot-stirring French git called General Castillion and two underwhelming bits of female love interest, who won’t get any bloke switching over from Love Island in a hurry. Also present is Citizen Khan himself, Adil Ray, who’s moved in next door wearing a glued-on beard that last saw serious action in Carry On Up The Khyber.So I hope no one was expecting a laugh, or a plot. Because Beecham House hasn’t really got one, apart from the baby issue and Beecham’s grovelling desire to be granted a trading licence, which both generate lots of sarky backchat from the locals, but not much .It all stands or falls then, almost entirely, on the leading character.And, oh boy, does this one ever fall.As absolutely everyone’s noticed, for the want of charisma they’ve had to dress the poor bloke up as Indiana Jones, which can’t be a lot of fun in that climate.Even with the overcoat, cowboy hat and women throwing themselves at him, John’s brother still thinks he’s “the dullest man in Delhi”.The thing that really weighs him down, though, is Empire guilt. The righteous berk can hardly look at an Indian without apologising.“Your Imperial Highness, I implore you judge me by my actions not my flag.”“I am not like my countrymen.” “Their hypocrisy sickens me.” “The East India company’s policy of expansion is shameful.” “I love your country and believe India should be ruled by Indians.”  He’s so woke he could be reading last night’s Channel  News.An approach that’s unlikely to win the show many friends, I’d have thought, or stop the more right-on viewers accusing him of having “big white saviour syndrome”.Ultimately, though, I have absolutely no real idea whether John Beecham will strike a chord with the viewers, because, like most shows broadcast in the Sunday night pm to pm slot, I am not part of the target female audience.All I’m meant to do is sit dumbly and join in the apologetic Empire chorus.I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m not sorry at all.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “In Only Fools And Horses, who plays the character known as Del Boy ”Ben: “David Frost.”Fteen To One, Sandi Toksvig: “What is the two-word term for a flashing orange globe mounted on a striped pole, used at pedestrian crossings, named after a s minister of transport ”Kresha: “Traffic light.”And Love Island, Molly-Mae: “What is the capital of France ”PSYCHOPATH With Piers Morganrequires expectations to be managed, because it’s barely a minute old when Porky-Talkie reveals: “The prison considers Paris Bennett so dangerous they insist I interview him behind toughened glass.”Andthat’s not health-and-safety gone mad, I dunno what is, frankly.RE: Love Island.

One job.” A phrase I don’t think I’ve heard any presenter utter since Kerry Katona was fronting ElimiDate, back in .Long before it got to air, Maitlis and the BBC had also clearly decided Boris was the “Islamo- phobic” booby prize, because not one of the researchers saw any warning signs being given off by Abdullah, from Bristol, who’d deactivated his Twitter before appearing on the show. The prize guy, naturally, was meant to be Rory Stewart, who liberal political commentators all think would make a great Conservative Party leader, in the same way they probably think Iggy Pop would make a great lead singer of One Direction.Turned out, though, he’s a fidgeting little oddball who was political toast long before he sighed at Boris: “I’m sure, like me, you’ve been in Enniskillen sitting with sheep farmers.”So, by the end of the night, an attempted BBC stitch-up had accounted for: Rory Stewart, one anti-semite, from Bristol, some other bug-eyed Corbyn cultist demanding an early election and probably Emily Maitlis’ credibility as well.Boris, meanwhile, just ploughed on regardless.Well done, everyone.Celebrity Crystal Maze, Gemma Collins: “Just being honest, it’s an honour for you to have me.”And The Last Leg, Alex Brooker: “The problem with me swimming The Channel is I can’t swim.”Problem how ON Thursday’s Shopping With Keith Lemon, former market trader Rob Beckett claimed: “I used to sell compost and you can’t up-sell a bag of s***, can you ”Yet it never stopped him trying on All Together Now.IT’S nearly six months since that great foghorning orca, Gemma Collins, last made an exhibition of herself on television.So I suppose we were overdue Friday’s appearance on Celebrity Crystal Maze, where she rumbled round the course, like Indiana Jones’ concrete ball, alongside Carol Vorderman, Ellie Taylor, Rick Edwards and her on off boyfriend Arg.And how that pair avoided wedging themselves inside one of the show’s duct shafts will remain for ever one of the Channel  show’s great mysteries.Gemma bellowed over everyone, insulted her co-stars, threw a hissy fit inside one virtual reality game – “Nah, sorry.

Here, its author tells the true story behind the film.One April morning in , a sardine fisherman spotted the corpse of a British soldier floating in the sea off the coast of Spain — and set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of World War Two.Operation Mincemeat was one of the most successful wartime deceptions ever attempted — and certainly the strangest.It hoodwinked the Nazi espionage chiefs, sent German troops hurtling in the wrong direction and saved thousands of lives by deploying a secret agent who was dferent, in one crucial respect, from any spy before or since: He was dead.His mission was to convince the Germans that instead of attacking Sicily, the Allies would invade Greece.The taking of Sicily was key, as it helped to secure the Mediterranean and paved the way for an assault on mainland Italy.The brainchild of an eccentric RAF officer and a brilliant Jewish barrister, the hoax involved an extraordinary cast of characters.They included the inventor of James Bond, a beautul secret service secretary, a submarine captain, an angry admiral and a dead Welsh tramp.Using fraud, imagination and seduction, Churchill’s team of spies spun a web of deceit so elaborate and convincing they began to believe it themselves.The hoax started in a windowless basement beneath London’s Whitehall. It travelled from the capital to Scotland to Spain to Germany — and ended up on Hitler’s desk.Operation Mincemeat originated in the mind of Ian Fleming, the creator of Bond, who worked in naval intelligence during the war.Soon after the conflict was declared in , Fleming drew up a list of possible deception operations for his demanding boss, Admiral John Godfrey, the model for M in the spy films.Onewas to find a dead body, equip it with  papers and leave it in a place where the Germans would find it.The most obvious place was Spain, which was teeming with Nazi sympathisers. If the body and fake documents could be made to fall into the right hands, they would certainly be passed to the Germans.The plan was put into action before the invasion of Sicily in .British and US troops were massed in North Africa, preparing for the invasion of southern Europe, but the target was obvious. Churchill said: “Anyone but a fool would know it’s Sicily.”The challenge for British intelligence was how to convince Hitler that the Allies did not intend to attack Sicily — and then attack Sicily.The two architects of Operation Mincemeat were lawyer Ewen Montagu of Navy intelligenceand an RAF officer working for MI, Charles Cholmondeley.Early in , they were tipped off that the body of homeless man Glyndwr Michael had been brought into the mortuary at St Pancras in London.He had killed himself with rat poison. After consulting with Sir Bernard Spilsbury, Britain’s top forensic expert, the spies decided the Germans could be fooled into thinking he had drowned at sea.Glyndwr’s body was put in the mortuary fridge and they set about inventing a fake personality for him as Major William Martin, of the Royal Marines.They constructed  identity papers, a unorm and orders indicating he was an important courier transporting vital military documents.He would also be carrying letters from his bank manager, a receipt for an engagement ring and theatre ticket stubs.Many years later, Montagu wrote: “We talked about him until we did feel that he was an old friend. Major Martin had become a real person to us.”They also faked love letters from a non-existent fiancée named “Pam”. “Bill darling, do let me know as soon as you get fixed  can make some more plans.”In the dead man’s wallet they included a photograph of Pam, actually Jean Leslie, a young and attractive secretary in MI.The most important fake documents, in an attaché case chained to the dead man’s wrist, were marked “personal and most secret” and indicated that the Allies intended to invade Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, and Sardinia in the west.A second forged letter, from Lord Louis Mountbatten, then chief of combined operations, contained the phrase: “Let me have him [Martin] back as soon as you are finished with him. He might bring some sardines with him.”Sardines, of course, come from Sardinia. Montagu wrote: “I thought that sort of joke would appeal to the Germans.”The bluff represented a serious gamble. If the Germans realised they were being deceived, then instead of reducing troop numbers in Sicily, they would bolster them, with bloody consequences.The body would be transported to the shores of Spain by HMS Seraph, a submarine under the command of Captain Norman “Bill” Jewell.While Seraph awaited her unlikely cargo on the West Coast of Scotland, the team constructed an airtight steel canister, six feet long, in which Major Martin would lie, packed around with dry ice to slow decomposition.Meanwhile, MI confirmed a particularly active German spy was known to be operating in the Huelva region in southwestern Spain — the perfect target for the deception.On April , they dressed Glyndwr in the unorm of William Martin, defrosted his frozen feet to put on his stf army-issue boots, placed the body in the steel container labelled “optical instruments” and loaded it into the back of a van.Shortly after am on April , the Seraph surfaced off the coast of Spain and the corpse, fitted with a lejacket, was slipped gently into the sea. Captain Jewell sent a wireless message: “Mincemeat completed.”Through MI’s files and wireless messages intercepted by codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, it is possible to reconstruct in detail the progress of Operation Mincemeat, from Huelva, to Madrid, to the German High Command.After being dragged from the sea by the fisherman, Glyndwr’s body was buried in Huelva cemetery under a marble gravestone that read: “William Martin. Born th March, . Died th April, .Meanwhile, German spies had intercepted the briefcase and fake contents and sent them to Nazi High Command.Goebbels, Hitler’s propaganda chief, had his doubts, as revealed in his diary.But most of the top Nazi generals were fooled by the documents. General Jodl, head of the German Supreme Command Operations staff, declared: “You can forget about Sicily. We know it’s in Greece.”Hitler was convinced by the deception. As they picked up the messages revealing the Nazis had fallen for it, MI sent a coded message to Churchill: “Mincemeat swallowed whole.”The results were extraordinary. The First German Panzer Division of tanks was moved to Greece from France to defend against the expected landing.German minefields were laid off Greece. An entire group of torpedo boats was redeployed from Sicily to the Aegean, and two more Panzer isions were moved from Russia to Greece just as they were most needed in the battle at Kursk,  miles from Moscow.By coincidence, the assault on Sicily was spearheaded by HMS Seraph under Bill Jewell, which planted buoys to lead the invaders to the beaches.In the early hours of July , Allied troops poured into Sicily, meeting little resistance. The surprised Italian defenders swtly surrendered.For two weeks, the Germans remained convinced the main attack would come in Greece and waited for an invasion that never came.Half a century after Operation Mincemeat, the British government added a new line to the headstone in Huelva cemetery: “Glyndwr Michael, served as Major William Martin.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Resign!” were directed at the homelessness minister Heather Wheeler.In an email written before she took up the role, Wheeler described rough sleepers in her constituency as “the traditional type, old tinkers”.The words were leaked and, lo, the outrage flowed hot and predictable. The Big Issue Foundation’s chief executive raged that such language, “has no place in this day and age” and so Wheeler should stand down.A travellers’ charity called her words “racist”, adding that “Irish traveller children should not have to grow up in a society where government ministers show such contempt for their culture”.Yes, Wheeler’s language was wince-worthy, but the leap to “racism” highlights the way race is used as a shield to protect the lestyles of some gypsy, Roma and traveller people from legitimate criticism.Recognised in the Equality Act of  as ethnic minorities, a force field of cultural sensitivity surrounds them. Any discussion of their culture can be labelled racist.Recent reports have found that travellers have it worse than the rest of us: Higher infant and maternal mortality rates higher prevalence of depression higher rates of chronic illness.They are likely to die more than a decade earlier than non-travellers.The educational outcomes for their children are terrible: The lowest attainment of all ethnic groups throughout their school years.They are far more likely to be excluded, and while  per cent of white British children stay in education past , only  per cent of Irish traveller children do.Officialdom’s response to these findings has been to blame officialdom or racial discrimination.The chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, thinks travellers have been “comprehensively failed by policymakers and public services for far too long”.Always, the blame is directed at “the system”.Always, there is the retreat into the safe language of “vulnerable” people and “marginalised communities”, because politicians are terried of asking dficult questions about why travellers are over-represented in prison, or why many of their children are failing at school.Such questions would only spark accusations of racism and discrimination.This is not to suggest that gypsies, Roma and travellers live free from prejudice.There is discrimination which is real and cruel: Allegations of holiday camp operators having traveller blacklists pubs refusing to serve traveller families children bullied in school.Yet whose interests do we servewe pretend that all of this is down to straightforward racism The usually sensible Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said that for gypsies and travellers: “Great Britain is still like the Deep South for black people in the Fties.”His analogy fails because it suggests the prejudice suffered is all about ethnic heritage, unconnected to the lestyle pursued by many travellers. This is nonsense.Though politicians will not dare say it, many in this country have negative perceptions of these groups because of their experience of illegal encampments on their local playing field: The littering, disruption and what might politely be termed “antisocial behaviour”.They see a group of people refusing to live by the laws the rest of us abide by: Trespassing on land with the police seemingly powerless to stop them breaking locks with no one prepared to arrest them parking on private property and not being towed away.It’s not racism driving this anti-traveller sentiment.It is fury that one community seems to live apart from the rules that govern the rest of us.The authorities seem pitully weak when it comes to evicting these camps. Councils must assess the welfare needs of those on the site before they can get an eviction order.Public money is sprayed on legal fees before the caravans move to a dferent illegal site, where the whole thing starts again.The authorities’ methods might be motivated by a desire not to “marginalise” travellers further, but it isn’t working.We need an approach which, while reconciling travellers’ desire to live on the move, recognises the desire of the rest of us to see the rules of the land enforced fairly.Part of this approach must be to make the process of evicting illegal camps surer and swter.But it’s no use simply wielding this stick without a carrot.The complementary action must be a building programme to create more authorised traveller pitches.Critically, each could have contact points with the local authority, with education and health systems, to catch these families in the net of public services .With more information on who lives where, the authorities could keep better tabs on who is educating their children, who is paying council tax, and so on.This issue may not make the hustings in the Tory leadership campaign, but it matters to the kind of country we are.Sensitivity to dferent cultures is right, butobjectionable or illegal behaviour cannot be dealt with for fear it will look racist, we are in a very strange place indeed.Giving one group a politically correct free pass denied to others is not fair, it is discrimination.Conservatives always talk about the importance of everyone “playing by the same rules”.Here’s a chance for the next leader to show he means it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost £.million  in the financial year to April alone.Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted — so the true cost is expected to be closer to £million.The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home.A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members’ club popular with celebs.Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up.He said: “The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.”He added: “The building was ed to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. “Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.”A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds.Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is “part of a five-year repainting and repair programme”.They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extrathey wanted a more bespoke version.Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household’s official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer £.million in  , or £. per person in the UK.It spent £million of that — a year-on-year rise of almost £million — thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a “blatant misuse of public money”.Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: “This year’s increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.“If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justy spending a penny on the royals.“Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw £.million at a new house for Harry.”Prince Charles used the train to travel back from his Scottish home Birkhall to London on - September at a cost of £,. He also used the train - December at a cost of £, to visit Cardf, and again in February this year to visit Port Talbot.The Queen used the train just twice in the last financial year — in March this year to visit Somerset and in June last year to visit Cheshire with Meghan.THE royals’ carbon emissions almost doubled — mainly due to royal air travel.Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by  per cent  year-on-year.This was blamed on the “higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel” and there were “five such overseas visits in - compared to one in -”.Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan.Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour.

The dramatic growth has seen a  per cent increase of self-professed vegans in the last  years, according to the Vegan Society.While vegans were once the butt of jokes, preconceptions have changed about those that swear off meat, dairy, and animal products, with more and more changing diet in a bid to improve our health as well as being kinder to the planet.Switching to veganism can see  fewer animals slaughtered yearly for meat, and thereaposs also plenty of evidence to show that a meat-free diet is the single biggest way to reduce our impact on the earth.HullLive reporter Anna Riley decided to give the vegan diet a go for a week - hereaposs how she got on.   It was tough at first The whole premise of  veganism  is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. This means eating a plant-based diet, avoiding all foods such as meat, fish and shellfish, dairy, eggs and even honey as well as animal-derived materials and products tested on animals. As commendable as this lestyle is, for a le-long meat eater, as well as often eating eggs and a LOVER of cheese, the challenge to go coldturkey was certainly a tough one. It was dficult at first to think of tasty vegan recipes to make for my meals that would be tasty compared to the meat and fish that were staples in much of the food I was used to eating.  Luckily, my almost vegan friendhelped me out when I asked for advice on what to shop for, and advised me to eat fruit for snacks, as well as stocking up on vegetables, nuts, beans and pulses to make a iety of meals that she sent over, including stews, curries, salads, stir fry and more. She also signposted me to plenty of vegan inspired recipes to look at online for inspiration.    It was more expensive and took time to shop Because I needed to replace all the dairy items that I normally had with vegan alternatives, my shop cost me nearly £ just for staples and snacks, much more than it normally wouldI was buying ordinary milk, cheese, butter, yoghurts, crisps and chocolate. Along with spending more on these items, there was also a much more limited selection on offer. I could only find two ieties of vegan cheese in the Tesco extra store in Hull St Stephenaposs Centre, which I was surprised by, and there was only a small selection of dairy free yoghurts. I went to Aldi for my main fruit and veg shop and was happily surprised to find a vegan section there, which included curry pots, sweet potato and beetroot burgers and red pepper and butternut squash sausages, as well as low calorie vegan pea snap crisps, so I snapped all of these up along with the lentils, beans, tinned tomatoes and spices in my trolley. As I wasnapost buying meat or fresh fish, which can add up, and instead bulking up on veg, Iaposd say that in the end I spent roughly as much as normal on my shop,not a little more for the vegan alternatives and ready meals. It also took me more time than normal to shop, as not many products are already labelled aposveganapos, so I had to scour the back of many packets to check that they contained no animal product at all, and even accidentally ended up getting cereal bars that werenapost vegan, as they had honey in them. One evening on my late sht I also had to grab something at Tesco for tea on my break but there were no vegan sandwiches in sight, as egg and cheese were the only meatless options, so I ended up shelling out £ for a tofu ready meal that was granted very tasty, but also very costly.    Tea rounds and office snacks were a no go Not wanting to bring a large carton of dairy free milk to work just for hot drinks for myself, I didnapost join in with the tea rounds other than to have a black coffee, and even then my colleagues would forget that I was aposoff milkapos and accidentally add it to my drink when they were making me one. Food Reviews  I also had to dodge the snacks that my kind colleagues brought into the office such as chocolate doughnuts and cakes, as they were also made with dairy products. Clearly, dairy is a lot more prominent in our everyday lives than I once thought. The food was tasty    I thought that I would be hankering for meat throughout the week, being used to eating it on a regular basis, but the food I made and ate was actually delicious - and the vegan cheese was even palatable, but of course not as good as the original version. There was plenty of iety in what I had and I didnapost feel like I was missing out with the vegan diet. The only thing that I did yearn for towards the end of the week was eggs, as I do enjoy them now and again for breakfast or in a fritatta or quiche. The vegan ready meals from the supermarket are definitely something Iaposd eat again, and Iaposd make some of the same recipes again, including the butternut squash bangers and mash, veggie stir fry, lentil stew, ratatouille, and curry, with plenty also for leftovers the next day. I also didnapost miss milk or yoghurt, with the dairy free alternatives tasting just as good andnot better in my porridge, tea, coffee and smoothies, and the dairy free butter even being nice on toast. The vegan chocolate also went down well, and I couldnapost get enough of the pea snack crisps. Other than the taste, another thing I noticed about the vegan meals was that I was not as full as I normally would be when eating a non-plant based meal, and felt hungrier than normal, perhaps because I wasnapost getting enough protein or eating enough carbs. Eating out was dficult    Despite their being places in Hull that cater for vegans , it was dficult to find a iety of choice when eating out at restaurants which cater to mainly meat eaters. I felt very picky when I went out for dinner to a aposnon-veganapos eatery, and was disappointed at the menu choice for my needs. Luckily there are places near me like Zoo Café which have a wide iety of veggie and vegan meals and donapost serve meat, but it would be nicer to see more vegan options on the menu at other restaurants around the city. I avoided wine and beer  Much to my dismay, and previously unbeknown to me, I found buying beer and wine a faff, as it can be processed using animal products such as isinglass , egg whites, caseinand even bone marrow, making it non-veganprocessed in this way. There are several common fining agents that are animal-friendly and used to make vegan wine and beer like limestone and silica gel as suitable alternatives, but it takes time to look for this on the back of a bottle, and is often more expensive, so I just gave booze and the pub a swerve for the week. But fortunately, virtually every brand of hard liquor like bourbon, whiskey, vodka, gin, and rum is vegan, so I took heart in this should I have wanted a drink. I felt better for it  Throughout the challenge, I actually had more energy through following the vegan diet, which gave me the boost to exercise more, and by the end of the week Iaposd actually lost weight and felt much better in general. My skin was also clearer, perhaps because I was eating healthier, and sorryitaposs oversharing, but I also noticed that I went to the toilet a lot more because I was consuming more fibre through all the veg, which may have also contributed to the weight loss. I also felt better morally that I was doing my bit for the planet and animals through the diet. Final thoughts  Even though I found the concept of going vegan for a week quite daunting, and found it dficult at first, I actually really benefited from the experience and would recommend everyone to at least give it a try to see how they get on. Iaposm certainly not saying that Iaposm going to turn my nose up to a crispy bacon sandwich from now on, or demand a nut roast instead of traditional old chicken, nor will I refuse a sausage and a beef burger at a barbecue, or shun a pizza topped with all the cheese. But living off a purely plant based diet has made me think just how much we rely on animal products, and how ingrained they are in our daily lives, which can be at times unhealthy. Iaposll happily give up milk, yoghurts and butter from now on, as I felt much better for consuming the non-dairy alternatives, and Iaposm going to make more of an effort to make more vegan meals as they taste great, and are better for the environment.

The council scheme - launched five years ago - is way behind schedule because of legal issues and red tape and at the time of filming last autumn, just  of the allocated  £ homes had been finished.One of these belongs to  childhood sweethearts Mel and Rob Hilton , who were prominently featured working to transform their £ house.   The first series also showed them dealing with some of the anti-social issues surrounding the area - including finding a bullet on their doorstep and witnessing a woman defecating in the street outside their home. In the first episode of the new series, which airs on Channel  at .pm tonight, viewers can see the remarkable progress Mel and Rob have made on their home. Where they were once surrounded by collapsed floors and rubble, they now have a beautul family home for their two children.    But some of the issues that faced them in the local area have not gone away. In the first series, the childhood sweethearts made the shocking discovery of a bullet on their doorstep and saw a woman defecating in the street outside their home.

The four-year-old is the spitting image of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs second child, and her mum believes she looks more like her than the aposofficialapos lookalike. Her mum Gemma, , first noticed the similarities after someone pointed it out in Primark last year. She said: Marcy looks more like Princess Charlotte than the official lookalike does. People stop us as weaposre walking past and say aposoh, she looks so much like Princess Charlotteapos or admit theyaposve had to do a double take.    The first time it happened we were in Primark in Meadowhall and the woman serving us said aposoh god your daughter looks like Princess Charlotteapos. I donapost know why anyone would think she would be in Meadowhall in Sheffield without her mum - Iaposm not Princess Kate! It never clicked until she said it, it was only when I looked at pictures of her that I realised she does. The checkout girl at Birmingham Airport last year when we went on holiday to Turkey was checking her passport and did a double take too. Itaposs very flattering, Princess Charlotte is such a lovely little girl - always good fun and always looks beautul, itaposs a very nice comparison.    Marcy, who lives in Sheffield with her mum and dad Dylan Culverwell, , is  months older than her royal lookalike and even likes to dress in similar outfits. She hates wearing trousers and is happiest in skirts and dresses, similar to little Charlotte. Gemma said: Marcy gets very upsetyou put her in trousers. She likes wearing skirts and dresses because she says she doesnapost want to look like a boy. If we go to the soft play Iaposll say she canapost wear a skirt because she would burn her bum on the slide or flash [people] and that she needs to have trousers on but it isnapost worth the hassle. At that point I just say aposput what you want onapos. She has a wide iety of clothing. I like things off eBay or Primark and then higher end designer items - I like to do a mixture for her. One of her nanas goes to America a lot so she brings her loads of clothes back from there.    I wouldnapost go to the extreme of dressing her like Princess Charlotte but itaposs nice when people comment. Gemma said that more and more people have started commented on the similarity between her in the last year - both online and in person. And although not signed up with an agency Gemma said sheaposs open to little Marcy doing lookalike work. Gemma said: People have commented on photos Iaposve shared on social media saying how much she looks like her. Marcy didnapost look like her when she was a baby but has started to now that sheaposs older.    I put up a picture of Marcy next to a picture of Princess Charlotte and those who already thought it agreed. Other people commented saying they didnapost realised how similar they were until I put them together. I even had a woman message me and say aposI nearly stopped you in the school yard the other day to tell you how much she looks like Princess Charlotteapos. Sheaposs not signed with anyone but we are open to the possibility of doing lookalike work in the future. Princess Charlotte is known for her confidence, and Gemma said her little girl has a matching aposfeistyapos personality. She has been competing in pageant competitions for the past year which her mum thinks has helped her come out her shell.    Gemma said: She can be quite shy when you first meet her and then she never stops talking. She loves having her picture taken - singing and dancing and doing little shows. The pageants sheaposs been doing for the last year have brought her on loads with her confidence and itaposs lovely watching her on stage performing. Marcy has quite a feisty edge to her but Princess Charlotte has too - theyaposre like your modern-day princesses. Iaposve showed Marcy pictures of her and said aposthis is who people think you look likeapos. She thinks sheaposs nice but doesnapost have that awareness yet of looking like somebody .    Marcy is always full of fun and adventure and always wanting to know everything thataposs going on. When you think you can have secret conversations in code, sheaposs already picked the code before youaposve decided what it is. Kids are hard work but the joy she brings you could never replace it.

Mayor Andy Burnham wants to create a London-style integrated transport system that puts passengers before bus company profits. Fares and routes would be regulated and bus firms would have to bid for franchises, making public transport less “fragmented and unreliable”. Labour and transport campaigners said Mr Burnham’s scheme could be a “blueprint” for other city regions, such as Bristol, Liverpool, Peterborough and Cambridgeshire. Mr Burnham said: “People’s patience has run out here and they want affordable buses linked to the train system, serving communities.” He will ask the Greater Manchester Combined Authority to approve the plan on Friday, then go to public consultation, with a final decision next year.    Greater Manchester would be the first city region outside London to use the Bus Services Act  to take control of regulating its buses.

Becki Van der Land is looking forward to meeting both babies despite discovering weeks into her weekend that one would not make it.Becki and her husband Cees were overjoyed to learn that they were expecting both a son and a daughter earlier this year, reports the Chronicle Live .But at the -week scan the couple, from Allendale, Northumberland, were told the girl twin was much smaller than her brother and showing signs of struggling. Tragically, her heart stopped beating five weeks later due to a genetic translocation.    As well as coping with the death of daughter, the devastating news also meant that Becki, , was at risk of losing the boy baby as well. But after more anxious weeks, he is growing well, and the plan is for dental technician Becki to carry both babies to full term. Sheaposll be born at the same time as her brother, hopefully in four monthsapos time, said Becki. It shouldnapost impact the birth too much, except psychologically. Iaposm feeling really positive - itaposs what you make of it, so itaposs still a very positive experience. Itaposs going to be the only time we get to spend any time with her.    Becki and Cees, an earth sciences lecturer at Newcastle University, had dreams of starting a family when they married two years ago. It was part of our wedding vows to have children, and we were thinking three, said Becki. Their dream came true for the first time  months ago when she gave birth to their daughter Ottilie. Becki said: Then we were ecstatic to find out we were expecting boy girl twins earlier this year. I sort of knew straight away it was twins because it felt completely dferent to my daughter. I also had a strange feeling that something wasnapost quite right.    On the first scan they both looked perfect, but at  weeks the little girl looked smaller, so we had scans every week. They said she was showing signs of struggling and was quite a bit smaller than her brother. What followed was two months of tests at the Fetal Medicine Unit at Newcastleaposs Royal Victoria Infirmary. Unfortunately at  weeks the family learned that the little girlaposs heart had stopped beating. They have since found out that she had chromosomal translocation called q-qter deletion syndrome and had lost her IGFR gene, which meant she had severe interuterine growth restriction. Becki said: Grieving for your lost baby whilst still carrying her and her co-twin is a bittersweet and unexpected situation to find yourself in. We were really upset but at the same time we were in quite a privileged position in that we had time to prepare ourselves for the sad news. The death of a twin puts you at high risk of also losing the surviving co-twin so we were again warned to prepare for the worst.    But I am still pregnant and growing rapidly with our surviving boy twin. He is thankfully looking strong and healthy. Carrying le and death now continues to make this pregnancy very special but in a completely dferent way to what we envisaged. We still talk about our girl twin as much as we do our boy twin. We have chosen their names which we look forward to announcing after they are born, just as we would have donewe hadnapost lost our girl. Becki and Cees are now raising money in their daughteraposs memory for the refurbishment of the counselling rooms at the RVIaposs Fetal Medicine Unit. She said: We canapost thank all the staff enough. Their care made the world of dference at one of the worst times of our lives. And on Saturday keen runner Cees, who is a member of Tyne Bridge Harriers, is taking part in The Spine Race - a non-stop, seven day,  mile race from Derbyshire to the Scottish Borders. Becki said: All sponsorship received will go towards the costs of refurbishing the counselling rooms. Their aim is to to make them softer in decoration with sympathetic lighting, furniture and artwork to create a homely setting.

Researchers discovered taking children on day trips, buying video games and magazines, and the extra cost of childcare will set mum and dad back £ over the six-week break. And they’ll shell out more than £ per child just on food and drinks, including meals out, lunches during trips, as well as snacks and treats. The average summer holiday, either in the UK or abroad, will set families back a further £. per teen. More than four in  parents admitted being ‘worried’ about affording a summer’s worth of entertainment for their family. It also emerged nearly a quarter of a parent’s income goes on entertaining their teen over the long summer holiday, in a survey of , parents of teens aged - who are in education.    Chris Brown, director of sales programme recruitment at National Citizen Service– a three to four week summer programme which helps --year-olds gain confidence, build le skills and become more active citizens in their communities, said: “Our research has highlighted an issue for many parents across the country who are unsurprisingly worried about the cost of the summer holidays. “With the long break fast approaching, parents want to ensure that their teens are spending their time productively, without breaking the bank. The study also found the phrase parents fear most – “I’m bored” - is likely to be first uttered just eight days into the holidays – with fteen per cent of parents hearing it after three days or earlier.  This is despite kids being treated to special, yet expensive, day trips nearly nine times each over this summer’s six-week school vacation. Panicked mums and dads also admit to running out of ways to keep their child entertained only two-thirds of the way through the summer holidays. And it’s felt by the teens too, with four in  teenagers admitting they get bored over the school break. Another six in  admitted they want their summer holiday to be aposproductiveapos, while more than half also wished there was aposmore to doapos over the summer holidays. The research also revealed it takes less than three weeks for parents to hit breaking- point and wish their teens would hurry up and go back to school. One in ten parents admitted they don’t know how to advise their teen to make the most of the summer holidays.  Three in  worry their child will waste hours on social media and  per cent don’t think they will get enough fresh air. Half of the parents polled also admitted being concerned that their child will ‘waste’ the entire summer, according to the OnePoll research. Ellie Smith, mother of NCS participant Bradley Smith, , said: “Like many of the parents surveyed, I always wanted to make sure that Bradley was spending his school holiday productively. “I can definitely relate to the  per cent who admitted to being ‘worried’ about affording a summer’s worth of entertainment. “We didn’t have the money to send Bradley on a big residential trip or pay for lots of small activities so when the opportunity to go on NCS came up, it was ideal. Ellie, , of Bradford, West Yorkshire added: “NCS is a fantastic and financially feasible way for parents to ensure that their children have a fun, productive summer without having to spend hundreds of pounds. “I’ve seen a huge change in Bradley since his time on the programme - it was le changing for both of us.” Chris Brown added: “With summer holidays set to cost parents over £,, programmes such as NCS can help them not only save money, but also ensure their teens are spending the summer building skills that can help them in the future.”Places are still available for - year olds to take part in NCS.

Meteorologists and Public Health England workers have raised the heatwave threat to aposLevel apos for the West Midlands, south-east and south-west England. In all of these areas, the chance of a heatwave within the next few days is over  per cent, with the Met Office warning that conditions could be dangerous, particularly for the very young, old and those with chronic diseases. However, before the mercury soars and summer finally begins, the country faces one more day of thunderstorms.    There is a severe weather warning in place for thunderstorms in north-east, central, east, south, south-east and south-west England this morning, although the worst of the weather should be over by am. Another weather alert has been issued for north-west England and north Wales today, with heavy rain expected, although this should stop at around noon. The warnings mean that both areas could be affected by flooding, with potential disruption to public transport and delays for drivers. However, things will pick up as the week progresses, with sweltering heat expected from Thursday onwards.  Met Office  chief meteorologist Dan Suri said: “It’s going to get hot and humid for some from Wednesday, with the highest temperatures expected across southern and western parts of the UK.  Not everywhere will see the high temperatures, however, as an easterly breeze will keep North Sea coasts much cooler. “By the time we get to Saturday, however, North Sea coasts will join much of the rest of eastern UK in seeing temperatures of  to C.” A netweather.tv spokesman added: Friday for inland south-west Britain looks the hottest spot at the moment, up to the mid s could be possible. Those at or heading to Glastonbury [Festival] could be sweltering.  Eastern counties will generally stay fresher, even cooler with a breeze off the sea Wednesday to Friday but by Saturday the winds swing around to the south-west so there will warmth for eastern Britain at the weekend as blustery showers appear in the west. Despite the rainy weather today, temperatures will be in the low s in south, south-west and south-east England and in the high teens where. Things will get sunnier tomorrow, especially in Scotland where temperatures will shoot up, although the mercury will take a slight dip for the rest of the country.  Thursday looks set to be a scorcher, with sunshine across the country and highs of C. Friday will be another sunny day, with the mercury peaking at C in some places, before climbing to a sweltering C on Saturday. Despite the heat, most of the country will only get to enjoy sunny intervals on Sunday, apart from south-east, south and south-west England and parts of Wales. The heatwave will subside on Sunday, when temperatures drop down to more reasonable levels, with highs of C in London. Met Office five day forecast: Today: Thunderstorms and torrential rain easing from eastern and some central areas, but remaining cloudy and murky with further light rain in places. Brightening up across western and southern parts, where feeling warm and humid, perhaps sparking the odd heavy shower. Tonight: Largely dry and cloudy overnight with mist and murk developing, especially near North Sea coasts. A few showers may affect the southwest later on. Warm and humid in the south. Wednesday: A few heavy showers possible in the far southwest, otherwise largely dry. Cloud slow to thin through central and eastern England, otherwise warm sunshine. Gusty winds across the far southwest. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Dry, increasingly sunny and very warm, perhaps hot across the west and south. Cloud persisting on some eastern coasts where markedly cooler. Potential for thunderstorms in the north on Saturday.

The Romanian woman, who spoke behind a screen in court today, was promised a better le in the UK by brothers Valentin, Grigore and Alexandru Lupu. But she and multiple other victims were exploited in a scam which earned the brothers £.million in five years. Police eventually found more than  men and women cooped up in a three-bedroom terraced house in Barking, east London, which was infested with cockroaches. There was a curtain in the middle of the room where they had beds and the curtain was separating the couples from the men, the woman, who was recruited from a bar in Romania, said.    I said four because in fact there were many more and I was never sure of the names. You can imagine I would change in the bathroom, but I could not sleep in at ease in my PJs. The curtain would move it would be pulled across because they had to get to the door. There was hot water, but it would stop precisely when you were having a bath. We were given a ration. The main part for switching the water on and off was in the kitchen. I was working around eight hours day seven days a week with one day off every two weeks.  Valentin Lupu, , Grigore, , and Alexandru, , were jailed for a total of  years at Blackfriars Crown Court today. The court heard Valentin and Grigore Lupu would beat and threat any of those who raised objections to the oppressive regime. Grigore and Valentin Lupu were both jailed for ten years while Alexandru Lupu was sentenced to eight years imprisonment.  Sentencing, Judge Rajaav Shetty said: This case involved the degradation of fellow human beings. It involved the denial of their humanity and failure to recognise that these are human beings who feel pain and misery just like all of us. That disgusts me. In effect you were acting as gang masters. The workers were subject to debt bondage. Valentin, and Grigore, from Ilford, east London, and Alexandru, of Forest Gate, east London, all denied but were convicted of conspiracy to require other persons to provide forced or compulsory labour.  Valentin and Grigore were also convicted of conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the transport of others with a view to exploitation and converting criminal property. Alexandru was acquitted of converting criminal property. Ian McLoughlin, prosecuting, told the court workers were forced to live in squalid conditions with the cockroaches, the insects, the mice.

Natasha Biran, from Manchester, had moved to Israel in August , where she met her husband Yair and now they have two children, Maoz, five, and two-year-old Geshem. Natasha has always loved travel and even went to the University of Birmingham to do a degree in American Studies, because it included a sandwich year away in Arizona, USA. In May , Natashaaposs father died and the family of four took a sudden and expensive trip to England for his funeral. The visit inspired them to want to travel the world with their two children in tow. The couple were both already working and making money online as translators, editors and writers and so were in the perfect position to become digital nomads.    A digital nomad is someone who can make their living online and so is free to move where they wish, thus being location independent, but internet dependent. I love peace and quiet but Iaposm also really sociable. The most important thing to me is to live my le with gratitude and love, Natasha said. Iaposve always loved travelling. I chose my degree in American Studies with Literature, History and Politics based on the sandwich year in Arizona, USA. It was the best decision ever. We spent a small fortune flying to England for his funeral and from there our journey just began on its own.  We didnapost make any special steps to save money to pay for our travels but we make enough monthly to cover all of our costs. Besides being a full-time mum, Iaposm also a part-time translator, editor and writer. Yair and I work together and all our work is done online. This gives us the flexibility to work and travel. Since the family left Israel they have travelled to England, Germany, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India. One of the biggest lessons of their travels has been how to keep their relationship strong while being around each other all day, every day. Theyaposve improved their communication skills and learnt to take time out for themselves. I think the main challenge of our lestyle choice is when Yair and I have our moments. Weaposre really committed to creating a harmonious environment for the family but naturally when we spend most of our time together, conflicts do arise.  The children have adapted amazingly. They love travelling. Geshem was really little when we started travelling so this is just le as she knows it. Maoz tells me he wants to travel forever. He has been on a total inner journey, heaposs become really flexible and open. The journey has created so much space for meaningful interaction between our children and their relationship has really developed, they are really close and share a lot of love and fun together. I home school my children on the road. This is also known as road-schooling and thereaposs a strong element of un-schooling weaved in there. Maoz is only five and back in Israel kids donapost actually start school until they are six years old. Theyaposre both really sociable and curious about the world and learn so much from all the experiences and people they meet along the way.    She added: We donapost know how long we will keep travelling for, we are always checking in with ourselves that our hearts are leading us and that our actions feel right for us as a family. Weaposve learnt not to make any sweeping statements about the future as we never know what will happen. We live a lot in the present and usually book our flights to new places about a week before we travel. Our family have been supportive, but they really miss us. We equally miss them a lot too and really hope theyaposll come visit us soon. You can travel the world without tons of money. Our hearts are the wisest compasses in the history of humanity and weaposll all be happierwe listen to them.

Anthony Harvey, , stabbed his we Maria, , daughters Charlotte, three, and twins Alice and Beatrix, two, at their home in Perth, Australia on September , . He killed his mother-in-law Beverly Quinn, , the next day. The Supreme Court of Western Australia has heard of how Harvey planned the murders and had bought weapons the week beforehand. He also wrote in his diary about how he would get rid of his family with options including leaving, filing for orce or making family disappear.    The twisted killer wrote about how he would prep for the murders and penned an entry about eliminating family. One of the chilling entries read: Tonight, I will kill my we and bludgeon and smother my daughters. Then the real hunting begins … but first my loved ones. Another entry read: “I am no psycho, I feel too much. I always have.” He also wrote about embracing his darkness and animal instincts. Harvey contemplated his financial future after eliminating his family. “I have a good job … I am not rich but far from poor,” he wrote. “I won’t have much money when I leave.”  The day before he butchered his family, Harvey and Maria went to the bank and she signed a form allowing him to use the funds without her. After he killed his loved ones, Harvey took £, [,] from their account and pawned other valuables. The shocking details of his crimes were heard in public for the first time in court on Friday at a hearing to decideHarvey will become the first person in Western Australia to never be released on a judgeaposs order. Director of Public Prosecutions Amanda Forrester argued in the Supreme Court that he should never get out. Harvey covered his ears as the court heard how he attacked Ms Harvey when she arrived home from work. He hit her on the head with a metal pipe before stabbing her multiple times with a kne he bought just days beforehand.

I love you so much.” Harvey stayed in the house for days before going to see his parents and eventually handed himself in on September . Ms Forrester argued Harvey should be “deprived of his liberty for the rest of his days”. “I appreciate it’s a dreadful thing to contemplate, locking up a -year-old for the rest of his natural le,” she said. “But when a person destroys an entire family in the way he has — in a premeditated, violent, callous way — then community interest requires that.” His defence lawyer said Harvey was young and was remorseful for his crimes.

France does not allow women to wear the burka. Many pools in France likewise ban the burkini. Burkinis, a mix of the words burka and bikini, are marketed to Muslim women as a way for them to swim in public while adhering to modesty edicts.    It remains controversial in France, where authorities in several French towns have proposed banning the garment altogether. Proponents of the nationwide ban on the full-face veil have cited security concerns. The swimmers were warned by leguards that wearing the burkini - which does not cover the face - was an offence.    But the women who took part in the protest at the Jean Bron pool in Grenoble on Sunday were happy to accept the fines they received from police in order to make a stand. According to news website France Bleu, officers fined the women  euros . Citizen Alliance said the women had been inspired by Rosa Parks to carry out the protest, which came ahead of what is expected to be a remarkably intense heatwave in France and other parts of Europe.    One of those involved, Taous Hammouti, said the women did not want to accept another summer deprived of access to public pools. It comes  years after their inspiration, Ms Parks, was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to white passengers while riding on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her defiance led to a boycott that eventually led to the end of racial segregation on buses in the US.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird.

Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing.

Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match. Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-turn-former-rbs-in-north-berwick-into-a-house","story":"The townrsquos Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed in June last year.

He knew that his Pa was loaded, he said, \"In that case Ill have the local beverage, fish and chips.\"SPAD said, \"Fine.\"And in  seconds time he said, \"I want to eat like Scottish people. I want to eat whatever Scottish people eat. I want the votes of Scottish people, I want the votes of Scottish people like you.\"What  could he do  Other than drink Irn Bru He was taken to a fishmarket. He didnt know why but he had to turn up somewhere, why not there  His SPAD said, \"Pretend youve got no money.\"He laughed and said, \"Oh youre so funny.\" She said \"Yeah  Well I cant see anyone  smiling in here.\"Day three of his campaign and Jeremy Hunt has irritated the north already. A photo posted to Twitter shows the prime ministerial hopeful sitting in an oddly empty Heathrow departure gate waiting for a flight to Scotland with the words: \"Just heading to Scotland for day three of campaign. Scotland wants a third runway for Heathrow and so do I!\":Irn-Bru and fish and chips: Jeremy Hunt bids to win over Scottish ToriesScotland collectively furrowed its brow. We... want a third runway  I mean, I cant speak for anyone I know because the topic of Heathrows third runway has absolutely never come up in conversation with friends, not at the dinner table, not at the bar, never in the office. I may, of course, be in the minority of Scotland-dwellers who fail to prioritise money spent on infrastructure  miles away in London.I am, though, certainly in the minority of people I know: I quite like connecting through Heathrow. I have never heard anyone Scottish ever express this preference - they quite emphatically try to avoid Heathrow, in fact.Perhaps the Foreign Secretary has been reading the prophetic, but lesser known, words of the Bard ahead of his trip to Scotland: \"Some hae flight but cannae skite, and some wad skite that want it. If only Heathrow had wan mare runway, we could, to Hunt, be thankit.\"And then, his spectacular misread of voters desires made public, Mr Hunt lands in Peterhead clutching a can of Irn Bru and a fish supper. The scene was obviously staged - there is no way in hell that fish supper would have been safe from swooping North Sea seagulls for more than mere moments. It begs the question, did Hunt have minions with Super Soakers warding off the birds It is the only explanation and one that bursts the myth of him as man of the deep fried dinner people. Yet it gets worse.:Union under greatest strain in living memoryWho, one must ask, advises Westminster politicians that supping Irn Bru will give them an instant in to the Scottish populace Hunt, who said he would, \"Protect the union with every drop of blood in my veins,\" during his visit, is pictured with a can of the fluorescent orange national drink having made mention of a Scottish great-aunt and childhood summers spent in Aberdeenshire.\"You can trust me,\" hes trying to say, with his can aloft, \"I love Jockland. Im just like you. Mmmm, tastes like girders.\" Actually, he described it as \"very pleasant,\" damning with faint praise.Hes not the first. A can of Irn Bru has become a political barometer of cross-border desperation. Forget his weak line on Brexit, it was the beginning of the end for Jeremy Corbyns relationship with Scotland when he was pictured smirking on a train with a bottle of Bru.:Irn-Bru will pay sugar tax on new energy drinkSNP MP Deirdre Brock was quick to criticise his \"silly grin\" and tactless misstep.Boris Johnson, too, has been foiled by a faked preference for Irn Bru. He was pictured in a stage-managed stunt enjoying the luminous elixir from a glass.This was his Scottish downfall. No self-respecting Irn Bru drinker would decant it its straight from the bottle - or can, at a push - but a true Scot would never use a glass.Irn Bru is no plaything, as surely any basic research from an advisor would find out. Whitehouse relations fell to a perilous low when Trump Turnberry banned Irn Bru for its deleterious effect on the resorts carpets.\"We canrsquot have it staining when to replace the ballroom carpet would be pound, alone,\" Turnberryrsquos general manager, Ralph Porciani, said. \"We have villas here with Irn-Bru stains in the carpets which I canrsquot let.This is so obviously fake news as to be painful. Trump himself must leave far more orange smears around the place than any stains created by the tilting glasses of well refreshed guests - think orange soiled towels, bed linen, shirts. Maybe not shirts. Perhaps his fake tan begins at the neck and wrists, the rest of him as peely wally as his Scottish heritage would ensure. Let us not dwell too long upon this thought.Give a Westminster politician an Irn Bru and he will magically assimilate, seems to be the thinking. The Scots will view him, can in hand, as a man of understanding. Sorry chaps.Irn Bru gripped in the mitt of a Westminster politicians with designs on a Scottish vote is nothing but a sign of the enormous disconnect between there and here. Its not a man with the common touch its a man reaching for the lowest common denominator and still missing."},{"url":null,"title":"toads-romans-railways-and-inverkeithing-to-benefit-from-35m-in-lottery-funds","story":"A museum dedicated to the Romans in Scotland, the Trimontium Museum in Melrose, in the Borders, has received more than half a million pounds, while a project to help save amphibians in the Forth Valley has received more than pound, in a series of grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.Also receiving grants are the Borsquoness and Kinneil Railway, which has received pound,.The Trimontium Museum in Melrose is to be \"completely updated\" thanks to funding raised by National Lottery players.The volunteer-run museum, displaying treasures excavated from one of the most important Roman sites in the country, will be extended.The town of Inverkeithing is also receiving more than poundm from the Lottery.The pound,, grant will see the historic buildings which form the heart of Fersquos first Royal Burgh restored and repaired, including an A-listed Georgian Town House.The frogle project in the Forth Valley will see habitat conservation and improvements taking place at  sites across the region, including the creation of  ponds, a series of projects prompted by the % decline in the population of the Common ToadSt Macharrsquos Cathedral in Aberdeen will receive pound,.Dating from the rsquos, St Macharrsquos Cathedral is the oldest in-use building in Aberdeen and also houses signicant stained-glass windows.Repair and conservation work will now be carried out, especially to the roof, and an event will be held in  to mark the completion of the restored Renaissance ceiling.Earlier this year The National Lottery Heritage Fund launched a new corporate identity and name.All funding decisions up to grants of pound million are made by the committee and senior staff in Scotland, and a new chair, Ray Macfarlane.Riona McMorrow, acting head of The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said: \"Making more decisions on funding in Scotland means we can focus on the heritage that really matters to people, creating jobs, bringing economic prosperity and improving peoplersquos lives right across the country.\"The awards wersquove made today not only demonstrate how incredibly erse our heritage is, they celebrate the thousands of volunteers who commit their time to making sure our countryrsquos past is kept safe for future generations.\""},{"url":null,"title":"global-heating-extra-11m-to-restore-scottish-peatlands","story":"An extra pound million will be available to fund projects aimed at restoring degraded areas following an initial commitment of pound million earlier this year.The investment is part of efforts to tackle climate change and meet targets for the country to be carbon neutral by .Scotlands peat soils cover more than % of the country and stores around , million tonnes of carbon.Restoration work includes improving wetlands by reducing drainage and slowing water flow on peatlands, as well as covering areas of peat exposed to the elements, helping to lock in carbon and reduce potentially harmful C emissions.:That sinking feeling: Peat bogs are restored across old coalfieldsEnvironment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: \"The impact of peatland degradation on climate change cannot be overstated -

Bailies of Bennachie outreach officer Fiona Cormack said: “It was a special moment to have everyone joined together around the top of the hill.“Participants sang along to the sound of the Kintore Pipe Band playing Scotland the Brave, Flower of Scotland and Auld Lang Syne.“Some did a Mexican wave, others swung arms and some took a little time to reflect on their reasons for doing the walk.“One family from New South Wales in Australia took part and there was great support for this community event from the towns and villages around Bennachie.”“Mither Tap means ‘mother’s breast’ and that led us to raise money for breast cancer care and the University of Aberdeen Development Trust’s research into cures for breast cancer through this event.“We know that many people who have been affected by the disease took part in the walk.”One of the participants, Kate Brosman from Daviot, said she was last up Bennachie after her diagnosis and before her treatment.She explained: “I promised myself that I would come back once I was through the other side. It has been a while and I wasn’t sure that I would make it to the top but I was just up in time for the bosie and feel I have parked the whole experience there.”Funds raised will be spilt after costs between the two breast cancer charities and the Aberdeen Mountain Rescue Trust who provided marshals on the day.The Kemany Scout group also came out to help with members assisting with car parking and marshalling. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gerry Stephens, Financial Director for Mackies of Scotland, Cllr Anne Simpson, Aberdeenshire Councils Culture and Sport sub-committee vice-chair, Cllr Gillian Owen, Aberdeenshire Councils Education and Childrens Services Committee chair, Cllr Anne Stirling, Aberdeenshire Councils Communities Committee chair and author Vivian French\"  Scoop up books to win ice cream prize viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"After the bosie walkers ed to the field at the Back of Bennachie where they rested in the sunshine and enjoyed pizza, ice cream and coffee and cakes provided by local caterers.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel. The first series was a joy to make and we have only scratched the surface of the beautul and distinctive homes Scotland has to offer. We can’t wait to get started.”If you’d like to be considered for the next series of Scotland’s Home of the Year, you can get in touch at scotlandshomes@IWCMedia copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon.

So many brilliant TV comedies have been dreamed up by five guys in a room and here’s another. The writers battle their way out of the room by wading through a sea of discarded pizza boxes, their only sustenance having been slipped underneath the door all the time they were finessing the funny lines. They blink at their first glimpse of sunlight in a while, and then send off the finished scripts – destination ITV.What, the same ITV which hasn’t produced a decent sitcom in what seems like  years, and certainly not a consistent run of them like the s classics Rising Damp, Man About the House, Doctor in the House, Please Sir! And The Lovers  Yes, that ITV.It would, our all-male quintet reckon, be too obvious to send their show to the BBC, even though the work stands comparison with Fleabag, WA and even The Office. Their show is perhaps not alternative enough for Channel  but equally it’s not trying too hard for a gold star for ersity it’s just funny. Hilarious, in fact. And because it deserves a big, mainstream, not-too-trendy audience it’s bypassing Netflix and the other streaming networks to possibly spark a comedy revival at a station where the only laughs in recent times have been the unintentional ones provided by Robert Peston’s hair, Simon Cowell’s hairand the clunky change of facial expression when, just before an ad break in the grisly crime drama, the lead detective realises they’ve been chasing a red herring up the wrong tree.: The greatest TV comedies of the decade so far:  TV shows you might not know were filmed in GlasgowAh, but there’s a problem. ITV no longer wants comedies written just by men. “I won’t commission anything with an all-male writing team,” head of comedy Saskia Schuster announced the other day. She painted a picture of men dominating the scene: hogging her in-tray with their scripts and outnumbering those from women by five to one, almost to the extent she has trouble getting out of her door, and of them shouting loudest during the collaborative process. “Too often the writing room is not sensitively run,” she said. “It can be aggressive and slightly bullying.”Bah, men. You can’t do anything with them, Jenny Eclair once declared from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe stage, and you can’t chop them up into little pieces, chuck them in a pot of boiling water with some carrots and call them soup. But they can be quite funny, and when they’re at their funniest and the gags are flying off the page, they iniably paint the male of the species as complete berks. They may occasionally dominate the writing room but there’s a long tradition, in the finished product we see on screen, of women dominating the kitchen , the living-room and, yes, the bedroom. Men in our comedies are never conquering heroes but hen-pecked husbands, deluded regional managers of paper firms and – most hen-pecked and deluded of all – the foreigner-bashing, Austin -thrashing snob proprietor of the hotel from hell.Fawlty Towers was a genius collaboration between a man and a woman, John Cleese and Connie Booth, writing together in the same room and they survived. That is, they didn’t kill each other, although their marriage didn’t last. Basil was terribly rude about – and in braver moments, directly to the face of – Sybill but she definitely wore the trousers in that relationship. And would anyone seeking an equal voice for women claim that in the comedy of the year so far, the central character wasn’t a beautully written portrait of a widow coping with loss, middle-age, suburban ennui, insensitive relatives, idiotic relatives and the most epicly snooty and cruel sister-in-law this side of a Mike Leigh film This was the just-finished Mum starring Lesley Manville and written by a man, Stefan Golaszewski. I don’t think Schuster would have been complaining about the lack of female input in the creative processMum was one of her shows but it was on the BBC. Fawlty Towers was a Beeb comedy, as was The Office, WA – which had the most tremendous fun sending up ersity and gender quotas – and Fleabag, admittedly the only comedy here solely penned by a woman. So where are the ITV comedies  It used to be a struggle to name a good one now it’s a struggle to name any, be they female-dominated, male-dominated or three-toed sloth-dominated. Schuster may be frustrated by the scripts she receives but ITV would seem to first have to convince writers that it is a good place to be, that it wants to make the country laugh in these gloomy times.By the way, five guys in a room  That tends to be the American model. The British model has often been two guys, one pacing around and jabbering and the other typing. Some of the greatest and most-loved and still-quoted comedies emerged from such unpromising, female-free surroundings, including Hancock’s Half Hour by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, the same duo who gave us Steptoe and Son, and Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais’ The Likely Lads.Steptoe and Son wasn’t heavy on women but the thought was there. Harold was always trying to don his velvet jacket and escape the rag and bone business and his dirty old man of a father to meet members of the opposite sex but never actually succeeded. And while Thelma in The Likely Lads was a bit of a dragon, the joke was always on Bob and Terry.But under the new diktat none of these fantastic shows would have made it onto the goggle-box and neither would Monty Python’s Flying Circus. That simply isn’t funny.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"no place for ageism in an ageing country leader comment","story":"Employers need to wake up to the fact that they need to accommodate older workers with one in four people in Britain set to be  or over by .The dramatic surge in le expectancy during the second half of the th century – thanks in large part to the NHS – still appears to be news to some British employers.For even though people are, on average, fitter and healthier than ever – and therefore capable of working beyond retiral age in many jobs – ageist attitudes persist. A report by MPs last year condemned the fact that a million people over the age of  were unemployed in the UK as an “unacceptable” waste of talent, blaming straightforward prejudice, casual ageism and unconscious bias.Despite such retrograde thinking, new figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that more than  per cent of people aged  and over had a job in , double the level in . : MPs blame age discrimination for ‘wasted talents’ of more than million over-s: Older teachers fear being bullied out of the professionAge Scotland said one reason for this is that people want to work longer “because they love their jobs”. They may also work for one of the main reasons anybody does – the money. Many under the age of  who have failed to plan adequately for their pensions will be relying on being able to carry on working in their old age.The trouble is, as Professor Wendy Loretto of Edinburgh University pointed out, there’s a gap between “employers’ and employees’ understanding of the opportunities and practicalities of working in later le”. That gap is one we must all work to close, given that one in four people are expected to be aged  and over by . While some people in their late s will be able to carry on doing their existing job, others may not be able to continue in precisely the same role but still have useful skills to offer or perhaps will be able to perform a part-time role, but not a full-time one.Whatever the retirement age, employers need to recognise this and make the necessary changes to accommodate them. Those that do not will miss out on talented staff who offer that most vital of qualities, experience. And firms may also eventually face action from Government becausetoo many older people are economically inactive, this will become an increasing strain on the economy. Long-term success in business is based partly on identying changes in the way of the world and this one is quite simple – an ageing population means an older workforce.And, regardless of the business-sense, we should all be judged on our inidual qualities, not pre-judged on our age.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh s tourism industry urged to act to avoid backlash","story":"An official report on the future of tourism in Edinburgh has urged industry leaders to encourage visitors to leave the city to help ease the impact of its #growing pains# amid warnings it is running the risk of a #backlash# from residents.The new dossier calls for ”concerted action” to extend the “footprint” of thetourism industry outwith the Old and New Towns, warning that space in its most crowded areas – including Princes Street, the High Street and North Bridge – is regularly unable to meet demand.Research for the Edinburgh Tourism Action Group, the main independent industry body in the city, said “collective intervention” was needed to preserve the fabric and look of historic areas, and protect the quality of le there.It has been published weeks after councillors agreed a new tourism policy, which includes commitments to make more of Edinburgh’s role as a “gateway” to other areas and “achieving the right balance between a thriving tourism economy and the quality of le for residents.”The ETAG-commissioned report also called for the growth of the city’s festivals and events to be “carefully managed” in future to reduce the risk of the city reaching a “tipping point” for the way taxpayers feel about visitors.It also recommends much better monitoring and control of the short-term letting market due to concerns over the impact on the availability of affordable housing and long-time residents.The blueprint, which will be used to help shape a long-term tourism strategy for the city, warned the industry against possible “complacency” over the impact of further growth in the next decade. The number of overnight stays has increased by nearly a third since , with the city attracting an extra , overseas visitors. However there are already plans to further increase the number of hotels by a third.The report states: “Tourism is growing at a time when the population is expanding, creating competing demands for affordable accommodation, available land, public funds and other resources. Its impact on the city is attracting greater scrutiny.“There are concerns public space does not meet demand in certain locations, during peak times and major events. The number of day visitorshas grown rapidly recently, however such visitors often put pressure on city centre infrastructure and attractions during peak times. ‘Growing pains’ associated with the development and growth of the city may lead to growing concern among residents who could oppose tourism related developments in future. “The city’s history, heritage and built environment are its biggest attraction. It’s important to preserve these and the feeling of authenticity through collective intervention.”Adam Wilkinson, director of the Edinburgh World Heritage trust, said: “The report shows the first tentative, but welcome steps towards engaging with some of the challenges that Edinburgh’s successful visitor economy creates, particularly the acknowledgement of its impact on the fragile and under pressure communities in the city centre. “There are some suggestions around how to relieve pressure on the centre, such as the idea of dispersal - which needs to be carefully thought through to avoid creating more capacity rather than addressing the problems. “We look forward to working with all those engaged with the initiative to ensure that the final strategy follows through on this report’s question of what tourism can positively do for these communities - a question that is yet to be answered.”Terry Levinthal, director of the Cockburn Association, the heritage watchdog, suggested the city’s tourism industry was “disconnected” from people who lived in the city and other groups with an interest in the city, saying it appeared to be “inward-looking and self-absorbed.”He added: “The call to widen out engagement is to be welcomed. “However we ask that the focus for development remains fundamentally focused on improving the city for its residents and its businesses who operate year-round.“The impact of short terms holiday lets must be dealt with as a matter of utmost urgency. “The over-congestion and under-management of tourism and festival impacts have reached the tipping point. Parts of the city are so overcrowded it is downright dangerous. But it is important interventions are done to improve the quality of le for residents first and foremost.”The city council’s new tourism policy, which was agreed last month, is intended to set out its “acceptable parameters” for a new long-term industry strategy, which is expected to be published early next year.It stated: “Edinburgh is one of Europe’s foremost visitor destinations, renowned for its creativity, distinctiveness and unique culture and heritage. “The city’s character and vibrancy help ensure it remains a destination for visitors - all year round. Our built and natural assets are on a par with anywhere in the world, and the city’s unique character is reflected and shaped by the residents of the city. Like most capital cities, we are a gateway to the rest of the country.“The quality of le for residents and the attractiveness of Edinburgh as a destination are inextricably linked. The one cannot suffer at the expense of the other. Distinctiveness and authenticity are what attracts the visitor and what makes the city such an exciting place to live in. Getting this balance right is essential for any future tourism strategy.“Sustainability, in the broadest sense of the term, should be the hallmark of the visitor economy in the city.”Council Leader Adam McVey said today: “Tourism is having a very positive impact on our economy providing , jobs and contributing over £. billion to the economy each year. “We want to see everyone sharing in Edinburgh’s success, and get the balance right between the tourism economy and the city as a whole.“While we can feel proud of our world-class status and our city’s ever-growing popularity, we must also recognise and address the pressure on our core services and on residents. We have a responsibility to manage that impact while promoting the jobs and cultural opportunities that tourism provides.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

A deep free-kick headed back across goal fell invitingly for Oates to clinically drill the ball home, before another quick counter-attack saw Daniel Simpson fire home after Lee Gale’s shot had been blocked.Their misery was complete when a long ball pumped forward saw Swanson misjudge, allowing Oates to complete his hat-trick at the second attempt.Shetland manager Kevin Main said after the match that he was #sick of hard luck stories this week#.#It was an extremely competitive match and one we were expecting. They won this competition two years ago, we watched that final and they’re a physically strong bunch of boys#.Despite the defeat, Main#s players can be proud of their exploits and he added: #“It#s been an absolutely incredible week.#It#s been full of full of highs#.This fourth place finish represents Shetland#s best footballing performance at an island games since winning the gold medal at the home games in . raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"shetland footballers lose in anglesey football tournament semi finals ","story":"Shetland keeper Grant Wood saves well to keep out an attack.

A long ball played over the top saw Jones hold off the challenge of Richard Arthur, before coolly slotting past Wood.Shetland captain Richard Arthurwith the officials and opposition captain before the match.

We came here to compete at a higher level away from our domestic season, our domestic league and we#ve experienced some great highs and we were almost there to get into that final.#On how hard it would be to get his players up for the bronze match on Friday, Main said it would be #tough#.He added: #The guys are hurting but I#ve asked them to pick themselves up – and pick themselves up quickly, this is just part of character rolling.#There#s a lot of positive to take away.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyFatal road crash: Our hearts and prayers are with family, says MP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"outdoors consultation","story":"MEA Council is planning to grow its provision for outdoor recreation over the next decade and want to hear what residents would or wouldn#t like to see happen in the borough.Outdoor recreation covers everything from clay pigeon shooting to walks, cycling, climbing, running and more.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Assemblyman Paul Frew says the the Department of Infrastructure propose major works at the junction of Sand Road and Woodtown Road.The DUP man, in welcoming the plans, revealed that the cost will be in the region of pound,, adding that he hoped the work would begin ‘very soon’. He told the : “This has been an ongoing campaign for me and my constituents who use this Junction sometimes on a daily basis .“ I first contacted DFI Roads some years ago in September  when they told me that due to recent collisions an investigation was under way. “They also informed me at that time they had a scheme proposal under development with a number of options being considered. “Writing back to them a year later in  DFI Roads then stated they hoped to be in a position to compete for funding in the next three years works programme which was being developed at the time. “By  we then managed to convince DFI Roads to put in place a number of additional measures at the junction. “New Junction warning signs and Slow markings were provided along with new enhanced signage on the Woodtown Rd.”Mr. Frew said that DFI Roads are now proposing to spend pound, on upgrading the junction although he did not specy an actual timeline of when the work will take place. He added: “ The primary aim is to change the junction priority from Woodtown Rd to Sand Rd to accommodate the predominant traffic movements. “This will also improve stopping sight distances throughout the approaches. I would like to thank DFI Roads for this upgrade and hope it gets rolled out very soon.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1561026848803.jpg--ni_s_major_winners_feature_in_mount_rushmore_style_tribute.jpg?1561026851000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20190620newsni s major winners feature in mount rushmore style tribute","story":"With The th Open at Royal Portrush set to shine a global spotlight on Northern Ireland like never before, Tourism NI today unveiled a fitting and fun tribute to our global golfing legends. In a specially commissioned visual, the iconic clfs of Fairhead in County Antrim have been digitally transformed into an eye-catching sculpture featuring the images of local golfing greats, past and present. Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, who will all now be competing in the tournament, feature in the design, alongside former Open Champion and Portrush man Fred Daly. Engaging the talents of Hollywood digital CGI artist Mike Campau, the tongue-in-cheek stunt has been designed to reflect how Northern is truly ‘Made for Golf’, illustrated not only by our sporting talents but also in our landscapes and rugged coast. The timing of the tribute could not be more fitting as Northern Ireland golfers celebrate their recent triumphs on the course, with Rory McIlroy winning the Canadian Open by seven shots to secure his th PGA Tour title and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowellafter finishing tied eighth on  under. Tourism NI last week marked the last official stop of a -mile community engagement campaign ‘The Epic Journey to The th Open’, and with just a month to go, Open fever is starting to take a grip of the nation as the spotlight falls on Portrush. Tourism NI Marketing Director Naomi Waite said: “With ‘Open fever’ beginning to take a hold, we wanted to honour the global golfing heroes who collectively have played a key role in bringing The th Open to Northern Ireland and, through their talent, have made Northern Ireland a growing international golf destination. It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years. The th Open at Royal Portrush will be beamed to over  million viewers across the world and is set to attract , spectators, with a team of , staff and  volunteers warmly welcoming visitors. Unprecedented demand from fans has led to record-breaking ticket sales and the event will be a sell-out on Championship Days for the first time. Rory McIlroy commented: “The Open ing to Portrush is massive for Northern Ireland - everyone is so excited and is getting behind it. I never thought I would have the opportunity to play in a major championship at home and I’m really looking forward to it.” Fans can still book their place at Royal Portrush on Practice Days with a limited number of new official hospitality packages also remaining on sale.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour.

The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\".

It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward.

Hundreds of mourners, including many of his BBC colleagues packed into St Eugenes Cathedral in Londonderry for his Requiem Mass.Speaking to those gathered, Father Paddy OKane, a close friend of Mr Friel, said that he left a \"rich legacy which will be cherished for generations to come\".The former teacher began his broadcasting career in the s presenting Friels Fancy on Radio Foyle, which ran for three decades. In recent years he presented Songbook with Eamon Friel on Radio Foyle and Radio Ulster. His albums included The Streets Forget, Here Is The River and The Waltz Of The Years.Fr OKane told mourners how Mr Friel had also been a teacher in London, with Republic of Ireland footballer Ray Houghton and Sex Pistol John Lydon among his past pupils.He made the congregation laugh as he told the story of his summers spent in his mothers county of Mayo, where \"once he saw a cow drink freshly made poteen and lay unconscious for two days\".Fr OKane said that his family - we Caitlin, son Colum and granddaughter Milla - have been left \"with a wealth of precious memories\".\"A few months ago Eamon became unwell,\" he said. \"It was later that cancer was diagnosed. \"He spent eight days in Altnagelvin Hospital before he was discharged. \"His son Colum showed me a video clip of him singing a childrens song with his beloved granddaughter Milla on Fathers Day. \"She was using the broom as a mic, Caitlin was on the piano. What a wonderful memory.\"Fr OKane told mourners that Mr Friel had left a lasting legacy.\"He was witty, fun loving, yet at the same time private and humble,\" he said. \"He carried his genius lightly. He has been described as our own Derry bard in the truest tradition. \"Another friend said that Eamon could make the ordinary, extraordinary for he had a sharp eye and a poets insight to describe beauty that the rest of us might miss. \"He was one of les true gentlemen and you left him feeling better. \"He had the ability to lt your spirits. Colum, his son, told me that he was such a generous and loving dad and grandad. \"He was jovial, kind, gentle, open, cheerful and cultured, who loved to entertain. He had the ability to marry melody and lyrics in a unique way. He was a master craftsman.\"Peter Johnston, BBC director NI, said he was a musical curator with infectious enthusiasm, a distinctive voice and style of broadcast. For Eamon could weave his script like a tapestry and had a brilliant turn of phrase. He has left us a rich legacy which will be cherished for generations to come.\"Fr OKane concluded his homily with the words from Between The Day And Night by Eamon, and asked the congregation to pray for the \"man who brought such sunshine and warmth into all our lives\".He called on the congregation to clap - just as at the end of a performance - to show their appreciation for the man who \"entertained us and brought so much joy into our lives\".Following his Requiem Mass, Mr Friel was buried in Derrys City Cemetery.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum. There is certainly evidence of suspicious Russian activity during the referendum and where.”"},{"url":null,"title":"twitter thread lets you pretend to be beyonces assistant for the day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He repeated his call to meet diplomacy with diplomacy, noting that Iran dismissed it two weeks ago as “inflammatory”.Mr Ravanchi said he agreed with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ call to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf region, but said that was up to the United States, not Iran.He ruled out any talks with the Trump administration.“You cannot start a dialogue with someone who is threatening, who is intimidating you,” he said, accusing the US of trying to destroy Iran’s economy.Mr Ravanchi urged the UN chief to initiate “a genuine regional dialogue on regional security … so that we will see a new region for the generations to come”.....Sanctions come off Iran, and they become a productive and prosperous nation again - The sooner the better!— Donald J.

The statement made no mention of the drone attack.France, Germany and the United Kingdom issued a separate statement warning that increased tensions in the Gulf since the drone attack “risk miscalculation and conflict”.The three countries called for “de-escalation and dialogue” and reiterated their support for the  Iran nuclear deal that Mr Trump pulled out of last year.Responding to the US administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, French Ambassador Francois Delattre told reporters: “The message of France is we’re in a time where maximum pressure only makes sense with maximum diplomacy. So that’s where we must go.”Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, also referred to the US desire for dialogue with Iran.“Some of the Iranian officials recently said that you cannot have a dialogue with a kne against your throat,” he said. “What kind of dialogueyou are introducing the worst kind of sanctions ever ”"},{"url":null,"title":"space station astronauts return to earth","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years.

all visitors to the forest parks, with work ongoing to remove unauthorised trails which pose risks to mountain bikers.Over recent months, council officials have received a number of requests from event organisers for events that will use a combination of authorised trails, forest roads and unauthorised trails.While organisers are responsible for providing relevant health and safety risk assessments and insurance cover for the use of unauthorised trails, no adequate cover or permissions are in place post event which council officials have warned presents a ldquoconsiderable risk to the local authority and those using both natural and unauthorised trails.Councillors agreed on Monday night to meet with mountain trail bike stakeholders and representatives from Cycling Ireland to

That is not the norm where in the public sector,\" he said.Dr Farry claimed it would have been \"fairly pointless, futile and counterproductive to proceed with the cap\" in August  and would only have led to a huge rush of claims.He said there was \"not a single thing\" he could have done or not done in terms of the PSNI case, and described talk of a cap at that time as \"a complete and utter red herring.\"He insisted that any attempt to introduce a cap at that time would not have got through the Executive, which he claimed was \"extremely dysal\" and \"a transactional clearing house\".Asked would it not have been common sense to discuss the matter with colleagues in the Executive, particularly the then finance minister, before making a decision on the matter, Dr Farry stressed that people in senior HR roles would have been well aware of the Bear Scotland judgement and its potential implications.Denying a suggestion that he was trying to push blame onto civil servants, Dr Farry said: \"This decision was mine. It was my political judgement that I made in the best interests of Northern Ireland and the public interest.\"Man trapped and seriously injured when wall in Luton building collapses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He added: \"In terms of my responsibilities, I am happy with the actions which I took. I acted with total integrity and in the public interest in the way I did it.\"On the issue of whether or not the PSNI should appeal the case to the UK Supreme Court, Dr Farry said he was sure the PSNI would be assessing last weeks judgement and will make a decision on it.Askedworkers should claim up to  years of back holiday pay they were legally entitled to, he said: \"I think employers should resolve the issue in terms of their workplaces and come to negotiated settlements with their staff around arrears. Where that doesnt happen I think employees would retain the right to exercise their right to a tribunal.\"Responding to the same question later in the programme, UUP leader Robin Swann said: \"If people are entitled to it legally at this minute in time. Now I am aware this may be challenged in the Court of Appeal. If it is we will see the outworkings of that. Butthey are entitled to it at this minute in time then they are legally entitled to it.\"Commenting on Dr Farryrsquos appearance on the Nolan Show, TUV leader Jim Allister said he should have directly informed the then Department of Finance and Personnel about the potential impact on the block grant of not proceeding with a cap.Commenting on the Alliance deputy leaders reference to the dysal Executive, Mr Allister added: ldquoOnce more the dysality of our failed system of devolution is set to cost the public dear.\"try catch  TrendingN.I. railway line reopens after tragic incidentExclusive: Joey Dunlops family issues plea forof highly sentimental items belonging to five-time world championBody recovered from N.I. riverWillie Frazer critically ill family lsquodevastatedrsquo by VSSTwo people found dead in N.I. house -

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been produced by NPE Media for BBC Northern Ireland, with support from the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Politics      Boris Johnson: Tory leadership hopeful says there are a wealth of solutions to avoid hard border after BrexitBoris Johnson - the favourite to become the next Conservative leader and UK prime minister - has said there are \"abundant technical fixes\" that could be introduced to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.

The information the Government has now revealed about tax accrued from frozen Libyan assets makes it clear that money is readily available to create such a fund, he added.: Libya-IRA compensation: Treasury refuses to sayit is taking tax on frozen assets: Lawyer for Libya IRA victims hits out at ‘delays’ and ‘ narrative’JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Traffic and Travel   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Traffic and Travel      Dual carriageway closed after serious collisionThe A dual carriageway in Co Down has been closed southbound following a serious road traffic collision, police have said.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
