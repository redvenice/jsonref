City health officials appeared without face masks at the daily press conference, to announce that there were “no new cases and no suspected infections”. Beijing, finally, seemed to breathe a little easier. The now-ubiquitous temperature checks, at the entrance to every office building, restaurant and hutong (alleyway), were dismantled. The Lama Temple and Beijing aquarium were open to the public for the first time since January and were immediately packed to capacity. It was a beautiful summer’s day – bright blue skies and the sharp Beijing light that glints golden on the city’s tower blocks.On Wednesday 10 June, 52-year old Mr Tang – feeling inexplicably cold and exhausted – bicycled alone to a hospital for a checkup and tested positive for Covid-19. Beijing’s 56-day streak of no locally transmitted cases was broken, and all signs seemed to indicate that an outbreak had been quietly spreading through the city for weeks. The might of China’s public health system, honed after public criticism of the early response to Wuhan, was brought to bear. Over 100,000 contacts were identified for testing, tracing and isolation, and thousands of samples taken from stalls around the market. Xinfadi was the perfect storm for an uncontrollable new wave. In the worst-case scenario, as the key hub for the city’s food supply, it had first-degree connections to most restaurants, bars and community markets across Beijing. Expand that circle by one degree, and you had every delivery worker and every restaurant-goer as a potential vector for spread.By 12 June, 36 cases linked to the Xinfadi market were discovered. Cases began to pop up elsewhere in the country, connected to Beijing. China’s vice-premier called the situation “grave”, prompting fears of more sweeping lockdowns.Relatively speaking, it was a small outbreak. By comparison, New York City reported 292 new cases on 12 June alone. Nevertheless, Beijing was put in what health officials called “wartime mode” to contain the virus, mobilising medical workers like troops against an insurgency. But who it felt like “war” for, in this case, was determined by social class and geographic proximity.Many of the initial cluster of cases were working-class migrants: restaurant workers who lived in the same dormitory, seafood sellers, drivers. Thousands of frontline retail workers were tested over the next few days. Videos shared on WeChat showed many being made to wait shoulder-to-shoulder for hours in crowded stadiums and parks in the searing summer heat.In “exclusion zones” around multiple Beijing markets, residential lockdowns and severed transport links were patrolled by battalions of hazmat-clad volunteers. But walk around the hutongs around Beijing’s Art Museum – an area of upscale shops and restaurants – and you could see that nothing was different: barbecue stalls spilled out into the street and raucous picnics continued with face masks around the chin.A curious tension emerged between the need to project normality, and to show decisive action. Another full lockdown would be disastrous for Beijing’s economy, but so would an uncontrolled outbreak. For the city’s service industries, this led to confusing mixed messages. Bars in some neighbourhoods were told to stay open as normal, then close, then open for a limited time contingent on testing, then close, all within hours.For the rest of the city, a familiar mix of dread and powerlessness returned. Over 2 million tuned into the livestreams of the daily Covid-19 press conferences, with officials now wearing face masks again. Even the memes were melancholy – a popular one featured a person marked “Beijing”, in full plate-mail armour like a medieval knight, who is then hit by a precise arrow, marked “Xinfadi”, right through the helmet’s eye socket. The shopping district of Sanlitun, which surely features the city’s highest density of cafes per capita, took on a deserted look as bars and restaurants closed.Beijing residents are used to the city changing suddenly before their eyes, but the pandemic and its lockdowns have produced a creeping feeling that something has been lost for good. Beijingers feel as if they’ve emerged into a new city and started new lives. The particular liveliness associated with Beijing street life, exemplified by the word renao (热闹), was the first thing to disappear in lockdown, and will likely be the last to return. The cornerstones of the city’s renao: live music, nightclubs, cinemas, karaoke bars, lamb skewers around tiny plastic tables on the street – are all “closed until further notice”.Where a reopening seemed imminent a week ago, this resurgence has pushed that possibility out into a distant future. On 18 June, officials from China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that the outbreak was already “under control”, but the experience has already revived familiar fears – that future plans are null and void, replaced by an endless present of “doom-scrolling” through social media for news and rumour.A second wave opens the possibility of a third, and a fourth. In Beijing, a city that came so close to “defeating” the virus for good, that means whatever happens, we don’t get to go back to the city we knew.• Krish Raghav is an illustrator and writer based in Beijing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d751a7b41aa01c91279f3d1c420cd22987327e40/0_872_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=816918a5aba17c9abbbc8788366edbc8","title":"kristin scott thomas alan bennett monologues lockdown i want action camels 600 extras","story":"Kristin Scott Thomas can thank lockdown for one thing: it’s made her stay put. But now she is craving the bright lights and buzz of a film set…If you went for a stroll in Rutland during the early days of lockdown, enjoying your daily dose of exercise in England’s tiniest county, you might have been interrupted by the sight of a strange woman ranting about her antiques shop and a dying neighbour. It was Kristin Scott Thomas, rehearsing her lines for an Alan Bennett Talking Heads monologue hurriedly commissioned by the BBC when production on other shows had to stop. Nicholas Hytner, former director of the National Theatre, has revived the series of one-actor plays, in which Scott Thomas plays Celia, a woman approaching retirement age with a struggling business and an accidentally cunning plan for how to make some cash.“The script was quite difficult to learn, actually, so I’d go on very long walks, and anyone coming across me in the lanes here would find me shouting with a piece of paper in my hand. Or people would roll down the car windows: ‘Are you lost dear?’ Did they recognise me? Oh I don’t think so – I’m not sure I have much of a fanbase in Rutland,” says Scott Thomas with a wry smile. Or rather, with a Kristin Scott Thomas smile, the one that suggests that the actor has been in on a magnificent joke for much of her 60 years, and that it hasn’t stopped being discreetly amusing yet.We are speaking over video from our laptops, she in a bedroom of a house she describes as being “in the middle of nowhere”, where she sometimes lies back languorously on her bed as she talks, sometimes sits up on it, and sometimes stops to wonder why her screen has gone dark. Somehow, her smart yellow dress remains immaculate throughout, as does her dignity when I ask if she is living in this rather random part of the country alone, or with a partner, and is this her own bedroom, with the matching set of landscape paintings in gold frames on the walls?I know the Paris chapter of her life and her marriage to a French doctor ended some years ago, their three children now having grown up and made her a grandmother. But Scott Thomas’s magnificent smile suggests that she will not lay out any further details of her love-life. She will say that this is her home, that after constantly travelling and working in different places, lockdown has made her realise “that I really am here now. And I think, I have been for quite a while, actually, but in denial. I try and make one French film a year. Do you know, I figured out that I haven’t stayed in the same place for more than two weeks for about 10 years? It’s just, my life – it got totally out of control.” So aside from her “heebie jeebies” about the virus, “doing this enforced keeping still has actually been incredibly beneficial to me personally, but my God was I terrified when it started.” Then she adds that she’s “got to go and open some windows, because the fire alarm’s just gone off and there’s the smell of burned toast, so God knows what’s going on”. Later, she says something that makes her sound exactly like Celia, her Talking Heads character, and admits that “my boyfriend always says I’m turning into her!” So there we go.The Talking Heads monologues were originally broadcast on BBC1 in the late 1980s (with a second series in the late 1990s), having been written by Alan Bennett in the days when putting plays on television wasn’t such a strange idea. Julie Walters, Maggie Smith and Patricia Routledge all performed, as did Bennett himself. Of course, under lockdown the idea has been revived, with the National, among other theatres, streaming recordings of their hit plays on YouTube, while other actors and comedians try to revive the art of monologue from home and even The Archers attempts to use the medium. (Fleabag began as a one-woman show, so there is recent precedent.) But Talking Heads became an instant classic of its day. I studied the scripts for Drama GCSE in the 1990s.Now, 10 of the 12 originals are being revived with a new cast (along with two new ones, also written by Bennett) thanks to Hytner, who has enjoyed a long working relationship with Bennett, and who came up with the idea of getting certain actors to come into a studio and do a socially distanced performance. The part of Celia, in a piece called The Hand of God, played in the original by Eileen Atkins, required a shop, “which we created in the most extraordinary place in the world,” says Scott Thomas, with some excitement, “on the set of The EastEnders!I suddenly found myself on Albert Square – in the hairdressing salon, made into a very nice antiques shop. I’m years out of date with the show, but it’s still iconic, it’s still oh my God, pinch pinch pinch,” she says, jabbing her arm, as the sun streams through her Rutland window. “There is a member of my family I should not mention by name who is obsessed. So much more impressed than by me working with Robert Redford.”She laughs. In fact, she was thrilled to get out of isolation and back near a stage, if only to play a character experiencing her own form of isolation. Scott Thomas drove down to the studios. She has been worried about catching Covid-19, and won’t go to the local shop “without looking like a total lunatic because I’m covered. I’ve got a mask on, I’ve got a headscarf on, I’ve got glasses on because I just don’t want to get sick and I’m still terrified of catching it. Horror. A lot of the older people in the shop here don’t really understand social distancing, so there’s a lot of, ‘Excuse me love can I just get that cabbage?’ So I’m covered up. And a friend of mine did get it and ended up in hospital, ICU, for 10 days or something. Terrible. I know so many people who have had it. And you know, because I’m, I’m getting towards the age group of people who are more vulnerable myself…” She puts on a funny voice. “Slowly tiptoeing towards it,” she adds, sounding in character once again.We discuss how good Alan Bennett is at writing these older females she believes he is partly responsible for British culture revering such women. She says that when America does the same they tend to be cute and funny, like Shirley MacLaine, or Jane Fonda in Grace and Frankie. Whereas here, there is huge dramatic reverence for Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith. “We think of these ladies as being iconic. We’ve been hugely successful in our celebration of the important old ladies. It’s actually very encouraging. And possibly because we’ve got an amazing Queen, I don’t know. But I do think part of that has to do with people like Alan Bennett, who write these incredibly generous-spirited pieces where you kind of fall in love with the character. I think that’s very specific to this country. When Glenda Jackson does Lear, you know, that is a very extraordinary event. When Maggie Smith did her one-woman show at the Bridge Theatre it was amazing. When Judi does anything we all fall over in awe.”So is it time to bury the lie that there are no roles for older women? “Well it’s not a lie – these are seniors. It’s the inbetweenies who are in trouble,” she says, going on to reference the stand-alone brilliance of Lesley Manville in the comedy series Mum.As for Celia, who befriends a dying neighbour for reasons that may not be as benevolent as she wants to think, is she a wicked woman? “She sort of falls into it, rather than is wilfully wicked. I think she just trips. This is what I love about Alan’s writing: all the tumbling that happens. His people tumble and they kind of catch themselves, and they do that in the language, and I think that’s what is going on with this woman who has found herself in a certain situation. If she stopped to think about it, she’d be mortified, but she’s managed to convince herself that she’s being a good friend. And I think that that’s why we’re all so drawn to these characters, because they make mistakes. You can’t really blame them for their mistakes, even though you feel a bit shifty about them. You can’t really condone them either. I think people identify with them so much, because he’s so generous with them. There’s always a little something in there you can recognise as being a human trait. It’s like Chekhov, he writes the most appalling characters and they do the most appalling things, but you can’t help but love them. You have compassion for them. You feel, ah yes, I know you.”Has she met Alan Bennett? She shakes her head furiously. “No, I’m way too shy to. I’ve been in the same room as him, but I’m way too, kind of, gobsmacked to be able to speak to him. I mean, why would he be interested? You know that thing, when you don’t dare speak to people?” I’m surprised. I tell her I thought she’d dare speak to him. She sighs. “I know.” She pauses. “People think that about me, too. They don’t dare speak to me either. It’s all silly, just human. I can’t stand it. I’d love it if people thought they could talk to me. Because… ugh… I don’t know. I have heard it said about me, you know, ‘You’re too grand,’ or ‘You’re too this’, or they admire you too… whatever it is.” She admits she has the same “totally natural inhibition” towards others, “which is, you know, what have I got to offer this person?”Of course, it is at this moment that my daughter wanders into the room and starts talking to the nice lady on my screen who doesn’t seem remotely daunting to her, all friendly with her shiny gold jewellery on, asking my little girl if she likes going to the theatre, too, and saying, “Oh, sweet!” when she finds out she is only eight. When it transpires we have all started growing vegetables for the first time in lockdown – and after my child has wandered off again – Scott Thomas muses on whether she could now make smalltalk with strangers about her newfound hobby of “potting”.“I got the seeds and I just thought, God, these aren’t going to work, so you just plant gazillions of them. And then they all worked!” She sounds truly delighted. “So I’ve been busy handing them out: ‘Would you like some spinach? How about 10 broad bean plants?’ It got completely out of control. I had to leave a pile of them at the end of the gate. But watching something grow, corny as it may sound, from a tiny little unidentifiable seed into a plant, is just the most amazingly encouraging thing. And it did help me feel less anxious. Because you see that things are carrying on regardless. Nature is stronger than us, it really is.”Has she been going downstairs in the morning and then tiptoeing out to see how the beans are doing?“Cup of tea in hand, in a woolly hat! Completely perfect Alan Bennett character. It’s totally terrifying.”Secretly, she is ready to get back on to a film set now, though. “Because we’re not going to live on monologues for much longer! Endless monologues. People looking into their cameras like this, people looking at Zoom like this. I want action, I want deserts, I want camels, I want 600 extras. Oh, apparently we’re going to have to CGI in the extras as well, according to this article I read this morning. And they’re going to try to encourage the leading actors not to face each other.” She is whooping with laughter now. “It’s going to be nonsense! How are we going to make movies? I’ve got things that are supposed to be shooting now, and I keep getting told by everybody, ‘Don’t worry, don’t worry it will happen.’ Yes, but when?”The only people who have given her a clear answer are at the National Theatre, where she was supposed to be fulfilling a lifelong ambition and playing Phaedra this December. It is cancelled, but she hopes only postponed. In fact, she laughs when realising that this monologue with Nick Hytner is the first time she’s worked with him. “I was so glad when he asked me to do something at bloody long last! I’ve known him for years and years and years. I was always saying why can’t I come and work at the National, why can’t I? Rah rah rah. He had to leave the National before I got asked to do anything. And now it’s cancelled.”But for now, she is landlocked in Rutland. “I’m basically a country person anyway. I spent my entire childhood in a tiny village until I was 18. And then I went to London. And then I went to Paris. I’ve always longed for this and now I’ve got it by accident. And really, really got into it.”She does admit that she’s fed up and longing for a night out. “I want lockdown to end so that I can go to the theatre, so I can see friends. Sit me in the dark with a whole load of other people experiencing the same message in different ways and taking it all in. I want dinner with my friends and a show. And even more, I want to be in a show. I want to do some acting now. I’m bored with being beany.”Talking Heads is on BBC One and BBC iPlayer on Tuesday 23 June from 9pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/184467aefa4d0fe4b930567f2b561946b582755c/0_166_4657_2794/master/4657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=520f532296cc07436a1e4f0192c1eea6","title":"university and arts council in drive to re brand soft academic subjects","story":"Shape campaign, led by the London School of Economics, will encourage more young people to choose arts, humanities and social sciences A national fight to restore the balance between rival academic disciplines and give back lost weight to subjects such as history, foreign languages, geography and English literature, is to start this week with the unveiling of Shape, a “re-branding” drive to promote the humanities and social sciences.The plan, shared with the Observer, is to emulate the success of the educational term Stem – which stands for science, technology, engineering and maths – in emphasising the importance of the core subjects it represents.By contrast, Shape, or social sciences, humanities \u0026amp the arts for people \u0026amp the economy, is designed to encourage schoolchildren and undergraduates to view these subjects as positive steps towards a high-status career. The campaigners also aim to ensure that grant applications for research funding will be given equal priority. They argue that at the moment those subjects that enable pupils and students to develop verbal reasoning, alongside an understanding of society, the environment and culture, are dangerously undervalued.“This is about levelling up the agenda. It is a way of establishing equality,” said one of the architects of the plan, Julia Black, professor of law at the London School of Economics (LSE) and fellow of the British Academy which, alongside the LSE and Arts Council England (ACE), are backing the campaign.“We are not setting up Shape in opposition to Stem, and in fact many scientists and engineers would agree it is wrong to deny that the sort of articulacy and reasoning skills developed by studying history, or theatre, or by learning a foreign language, have the same value as a scientific or mathematical training. But the humanities can sometimes be dismissed as ‘soft subjects’ and not given the same credit, which matters when it comes to basic education and to funding research. They can be a bit of a blind spot and that is damaging.”The gulf between the stereotypes of “rigorous scientific thinking” and the more expressive and empathetic abilities that characterise the humanities has been controversial since CP Snow’s influential lecture on “the two cultures” at Cambridge University in 1959. As a result the letter “A”, for the arts, has sometimes been added to Stem to make Steam, but this is not enough for those behind the new promotional push.Writing in the Observer online, Sir Peter Bazalgette, a former chairman of ACE, criticised “a growing trend in government to judge the success of a course by the salaries earned on graduation. On this measure many of the courses our creative industries rely on would be discontinued. Many of these jobs at trainee level are undertaken for love, not money.” Bazalgette, now chair of ITV, added that this lower-paid work goes on to feed Britain’s large creative economy. When Stem and Shape come together in good governments and commercial ventures, he wrote, “we find a healthy symbiosis that would astonish Snow”.The term Stem has been widely used in Britain from 2001 as a tool to promote national competitiveness in these areas and to encourage schools and colleges to prioritise these subjects.Black said that while the significance of education should not be reduced to a consideration of its impact on the economy, it will be crucial for the future of Britain to begin to value those subjects where human behaviour takes centre stage, as well as those in which numbers and scientific properties are studied. “I see it as broadening the score card. We know that if we are going to build a better country, or develop a former industrial region, you can’t do that just by building science parks,” she said.The new acronym Shape, Black added, will now allow those disciplines it represents to cluster together to gain greater public status and to challenge a harmful academic narrative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b03f615a4d0f40605f15ab3d812e6c55ab41485/0_131_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02777e0a2f5dac28500dbc26daab66b4","title":"the cats whiskers new way of counting lions could boost conservation efforts","story":"Scientists say current methods of estimating lion numbers could be drastically wrong, with serious consequences for the big catsFrom widescreen high-definition wildlife documentaries to food brands, royal crests, sporting teams and Disney movies, the lion is one of the most appropriated and revered animals on the planet.But this reverence sits in contrast to the falling numbers of the living, breathing muscular cats in Africa.In recent years, scientists have discovered a major problem underpinning efforts to conserve the big cat. Some are arguing that almost all the estimates of how many African lions are left, and where they are, could be wildly wrong.“We are just fundamentally not counting them properly,” says Alexander Braczkowski, a researcher based at the Resilient Conservation Laboratory at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia.Braczkowski is among a group of researchers refining a new method of understanding not just how many African lions there are, but how they move, where they might be thriving and – ultimately – how to spend the millions of dollars each year that go towards their conservation.Braczkowski put the method to the test during a year spent monitoring and filming lions in the Queen Elizabeth conservation area in Uganda, as part of research at the University of Queensland.Braczkowski found the area’s lions were in a precarious state, with the home ranges of males much larger than previously estimated – suggesting they were having to travel further to find food.“The way these animals move is telling you how well they’re doing,” he says. “Small home ranges equals a lot of food.”Dr Arjun Gopalaswamy, a co-author of work with Braczkowski and science adviser to the Wildlife Conservation Society’s global programs, says this is a concerning trend, because larger home range sizes in big cats are usually associated with reduced density.“There’s great value in using methods that keep track of lion populations directly and we urge conservation and research communities to cease using ad hoc, indirect methods and shift to more reliable and direct methods,” he says.Braczkowski says he and colleagues have discovered that two established methods to count lions dominate most of published conservation studies.One involves searching for lion tracks on the ground and then extrapolating the findings to much wider areas using an equation developed decades ago.But Braczkowski says this method doesn’t account for the fact that lion numbers could be much more dense in some habitats than others, or the difficulty in counting tracks in places where they do not leave footprints.Another method is known as a “call-up survey” where observers go out at night with a large speaker and play distress calls of prey animals, then count the lions as they emerge from the darkness, hoping for an easy meal. But this runs the risk of counting the same animal twice – or of some animals not responding to the sounds.These methods, says Braczkowski, are “simply not reliable enough to understand how lion populations are doing over time”.The current estimates for lions across Africa suggest there are between 20,000 and 30,000 animals, spread among 102 populations across about 2.5m sq km.Numbers are known to be declining, but by how much, and where, is the subject of intense debate and great uncertainty.Even so, Braczkowski, who grew up in South Africa, says their numbers have likely dropped by half since 1994, “coincidentally the same year Disney’s The Lion King was released”.Braczkowski’s work is part of a method known as “spatial capture recapture statistics” that has been widely used to understand the conservation concerns for other big cats, but has almost never been used to examine the health of African lion populations.In a review of studies into African lion numbers, Braczkowski and colleagues argued the overuse of methods such as call-up surveys and track counting could be having a disastrous effect on lion conservation efforts.“This could have catastrophic consequences since underestimating lion numbers might cause us to triage an otherwise viable population, while overestimating density might cause under-investment in a population that requires active management,” they wrote.“Furthermore, non-robust methods can often produce spurious trends in lion population dynamics, which can further mislead conservation investments.”Between November 2017 and February 2018 , he spent 90 days in a vehicle with a GPS logger armed with high-resolution cameras and video equipment. Covering 8,250km, he and colleagues counted and photographed lions.In this part of Africa, the lions have an unusual habit of spending the daytime in trees.Braczkowski used this daylight opportunity to photograph the lions’ “whisker pattern” – the places on the face where the whiskers emerge from the fur in a pattern that is unique to each cat.“We used the cinematic cameras to zoom in on the lion’s face but, actually, most cameras can do this,” he says.Using this method, observers can be more confident they are not counting the same animal twice.As well as providing a detailed record of each observed lion, the method also has the bonus of amassing hundreds of stunning close-ups of the animals.Braczkowski and colleagues hope this approach could be used more widely across Africa. He says it has already been rolled out systematically by the Kenyan government.“There’s a growth of emerging studies now showing there’s a better way. We’ve got the technology and the cameras and the science. We need to start using it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206fc4b306bd65f119d7fe59e3cbdc7a4cc96f4b/0_300_7360_4415/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bba271bc95756eb058a2228236d011ab","title":"from panic buying to food banks how britain fed itself in the first phase of coronavirus","story":"From farmers to supermarket chiefs to frontline workers, this is the inside story of the food supply chain and Covid-19. Were we prepared for the storm – and what happens next? For Kim McMaster the crisis began on 21 March. Each Saturday night she visits the vast Tesco Extra on Sheffield’s Savile Street to collect surplus food on behalf of the Norfolk Park Tenants and Residents Association. It’s then redistributed to about 100 people in need through a community pantry scheme run out of a local church. “Normally there will be eight to 10 trays waiting for us,” she says. “Fresh fruit, veg, eggs, bread, a full mix.” That Saturday there were no fresh vegetables at all. There really wasn’t much of anything. “There were just two trays. The manager was very upset. He said the shop had been stripped bare so there wasn’t any surplus.”In London, at the Deptford headquarters of FareShare, the charity which redistributes food from throughout the supply chain that would otherwise go to waste, the story was becoming horribly familiar. As well as receiving deliveries direct from supermarkets and producers into their warehouses, FareShare has 7,000 affiliated charities across the country – food banks, community kitchens and the like – which, as with the Norfolk Park group , collect surplus direct from inidual branches. But those supermarkets suddenly had nothing to give. “Almost overnight these charities had their supply cut off at the knees,” says the chief executive, Lindsay Boswell. “There was nothing we could do.”It is one acute story from the frontline of the Covid-19 lockdown of 2020. We have all experienced the crisis in different ways. For some it has been the tedium of enforced idleness for others, the life-changing trauma of loved ones lost to the disease. The one universal has been the daily drudge of keeping ourselves and our families fed, as a complex food supply chain creaked, wobbled and at times seemed at risk of collapse. We have queued outside supermarkets. We have scanned bare shelves. We have refreshed online shopping sites repeatedly until our fingers have cramped. For those charged with keeping those shelves stocked it has been a challenge without precedent one that appears to have been met. The question is, for how long?\u0026nbspMany in the UK’s food industry admit the storm crept up on them. “In early February I’d just finished a meeting with Chris Kebbell, the counsellor for agriculture at the New Zealand High Commission,” says Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents the sector’s manufacturers. “He said: ‘So what are you going to do to prepare for quarantine?’ I asked him, what do you mean? He said: ‘Something big is coming.’”Over at Sainsbury’s Patrick Miller, who heads the 50-strong team responsible for the company’s non-fresh goods supply chain, had noticed a change. “It was February half term. We recognised a move in customer behaviour. They were topping up on things like rice and pasta, products they could tuck away in cupboards.”On 2 March Bruno Monteyne, a former Tesco executive turned business analyst with global investment firm Alliance Bernstein, published a startling newsletter predicting panic buying, empty shelves and even food riots, with the army deployed to protect stores. “Yes, it will be chaotic (and expect pictures of empty shelves),” he wrote, “but the industry will reduce complexity to keep the country fed.”The analysis, which many in the food retail sector admit was their first hint of what was to come, was based on war gaming that Tesco had done back around 2010. “There were training days with all the senior people,” Monteyne says now. “The objective was to think our way through a scenario exactly like the one we have now.”A similar exercise was repeated just four years ago by Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis. They imagined what would happen if they had to shut down the head office. “At the time people said it was a bit ridiculous and extreme,” Lewis said recently.\u0026nbspNewspapers and websites filled with reports of panic buying, of people squabbling over packs of toilet roll, of the elderly and infirm failing to fight their way to what they needed crucially, of exhausted NHS workers coming off shift and being unable to buy food for their families. “It wasn’t panic buying,” says Wright. “It was perfectly logical buying.” People knew that something big really was coming.At the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Chris Tyas, a former executive from Nestlé, was brought in to head the Food Resilience Industry Forum. It was a clear sign that the government was, in the words of Tim Lang, veteran professor of food policy at City University, going to “leave it to Tesco”. Feeding the nation was now a matter for the retailers.From 26 March, every day at 8am the forum held a phone conference involving up to 120 people from the industry (it now meets twice weekly). Through the forum, the major retailers lobbied government to relax competition law, so the likes of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons could agree to the same limits on how many packets of pasta or rolls of toilet paper each customer could buy. Delivery hours for trucks were relaxed, so they could keep restocking supermarkets after hours.\u0026nbspLater, the forum was called upon to sort one major issue: lack of supply into the UK’s vital convenience stores. “Massive buying swept into our sector about five to seven days after it reached the supermarkets,” says James Lowman of the Association of Convenience Stores. And, if anything, trade was up even more than in the supermarkets. “We had the same number of customers but they had gone from spending around £9 each visit to over £16.”There are more than 45,000 convenience stores on the UK mainland and they were all now finding it tough to get stock. “Less was going to the wholesalers who supply them because it was going to the supermarkets,” says Lowman. “That’s partly market forces. You don’t piss off your biggest customers.“It has been exhausting for our members. They’ve traded well but they’ve incurred extra costs and are wrung out. And they’ve done so at great personal risk.” Indeed. An analysis by the Office for National Statistics found that people in food and hospitality trades were at much higher than average risk of dying from Covid-19.\u0026nbspBack at FareShare, Lindsay Boswell found that the closure of the hospitality sector was a temporary godsend. “Very quickly we were being offered enormous amounts of food from that supply chain,” he says. “It went into our warehouses and we redirected our charities there.” They needed it because, as the economy stuttered to a halt, many workers, and especially the self-employed and those dependent on the gig economy, found themselves in dire straits.In Sheffield, McMaster switched from a pantry model to delivering food packages door to door. “We went from supporting 100 people to supporting 400,” she says. It was a similar story in London. “A charity in central London which used to provide two meals a week for 70 people is now running a daily service for 300 people,” says Boswell. Some of that was down to food charities closing down their operations. But much of it was simple demand. As Boswell says: “In April FareShare provided food for 11.6 million meals. That’s three times more than we’d ever done before.”At Agriculture House, the headquarters of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) just south of Coventry, Boris Johnson’s 16 March press conference was received with mounting anxiety. “I watched it in my office with a number of colleagues,” says Philip Hambling, the NFU’s head of food and farming. “We immediately knew there was going to be an impact for some of our members because of the closure of the hospitality sector. The problem was judging exactly the size and shape of it, because nothing like this had ever happened before.”If there was a vertical relationship between farmers and retailers, so that food products simply went to where they were required, everything would have been fine. But it doesn’t work like that. “There are many dairy farmers who supply processors, who in turn only supply cafes and restaurants rather than retailers,” Hambling says. “They had the door slammed in their face.” Even though there was increased demand from those retailers, there were dairy farmers who were forced to pour milk away, and even consider culling cows.The government also announced that it would be sending the most vulnerable a weekly food package, passing the bulk of the heavy lifting to the food service companies, Brakes and Bidfood. Many recipients posted pictures on social media of what they had received. A lot expressed gratitude for the government’s intervention. However, they also questioned the contents. While there was a fair amount of fresh fruit, the packs were heavy with simple carbs – white bread, white pasta – and low in protein. What protein there was seemingly came from an enormous consignment of Fray Bentos chicken meatballs. Likewise in Bristol, Peter Overton, a clearly exasperated primary school headteacher, tweeted a picture of the dismal offering for pupils on free school meals for a week: alongside a piece of fruit a day, there were biscuits, crisps, a loaf of cheap sliced bread and a block of fat specifically marked as for baking only. “The school pays the contractor £11 for this,” wrote Overton. “Shameful!”He was not the only one with doubts. On 1 April, a letter signed by leading academics was sent to both Defra and Public Health England (PHE) calling on them to establish an expert committee to oversee nutrition during the crisis. “It would have made sure that the 1.5 million people who received food parcels weren’t sent the crap that arrived,” says Prof Tim Lang, the letter’s author. “And that school meals were similarly audited.” Defra replied on 28 April saying nutrition was a matter for Public Health England. Two weeks later PHE replied, saying the matters raised were “for ministers”. They had at least been consistent: both had said the nutritional health of the nation wasn’t their problem.Now, here we are in late June, with the lockdown easing. Save for a few gaps, such as flour and yeast, the shelves are mostly full again. “To some degree it’s an impressive achievement to have got it all back so quickly,” says Wright. Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium agrees. “We were worried about fresh produce as we are dependent on much of that coming from Spain, which had its own problems, but we didn’t see any drop off.”Lang, who published a major book on Britain’s fragile food security just as lockdown started, is less convinced. “My critics have said we were wrong, there was no mass starvation. It was messy but we got it sorted. Well yes, but that’s because it’s been an extraordinary bonanza for food retail.” And it worked, he says, because “Europe fed us”. Boswell has his own concerns. “My main message is please don’t think this crisis is over. I’m terrified of the long-term issues, of the number of people who are going to need the help of frontline charities for a while to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb283ac2f360a0a6372483518e8ffde959ed29c3/0_378_6644_3989/master/6644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b56a658d8525de716ac8b9f2761a49d","title":"the 20 best wines for summer 2020","story":"Budget fizz, elegant rosés, the best whites and reds … perfect for sipping in the sunAldi Organic Prosecco Italy 2016 (£7.99, Aldi)From £10 champagnes to off-the-beaten-track French crémant, Aldi has a knack with budget fizz.

For some reason I’d not tried the rosé until recently, but it’s an excellent wine in its own right, with just the right balance of berries, brioche and briskness.Best buyRathfinny Blanc de Blancs East Sussex, UK 2016 (from £36.50, rathfinnyestate leaandsandeman hedonism)One of the biggest new ventures in English wine, Rathfinny is based in a single vineyard in Alfriston in the South Downs.

Which makes this soft, fragrant, slinky red-fruited gem from the coolish Pacific-adjacent Casablanca valley a standout bargain.Taste the Difference Marzemino Trentino Italy 2018 (£8, Sainsbury’s)Exuberant, fresh blackberry summer pudding fruit is the hallmark of this vibrant, vivid red made from the local marzemino variety in Alpine northern Italy’s Tentino region. Another one for drinking chilled, preferably with a plate of salami to hand.\u0026nbspLes Nivières Saumur Loire, France 2018 (£9.49, Waitrose)An evergreen summer red from the Waitrose list, this vintage is full of the crunchy fresh currant fruit, graphite and streak of acidity that makes the cabernet franc of the Loire such a refreshing choice, chilled down, with salmon on a hot day.Trimbach Pinot Noir Réserve Alsace, France 2018 (from £16, thewinesociety greatwesternwine)Still better known for their spicy, sumptuous whites, producers in Alsace are getting better and better at ripening pinot noir.

Perfect with barbecued fish and seafood.Tendu Cortese Clarksburg, California, USA 2018 (from £19.99, oxfordwine nekterwines)It’s rare to find cortese outside its home (like timorasso) in Piedmont, where it is used to make gavi. But star Californian winemakers Jill and Steve Mathiasson have made a delightful example here, with a wave of mineral freshness, tangy citrus and downy soft white peaches.\u0026nbspMassa Derthona Timorasso Tortonesi Piedmont, Italy 2016 (£21.50, cadmanfinewines)One of my favourite Italian whites is made entirely from the rare timorasso grape variety and it shimmers with concentrated preserved lemon and peach.

The rest is down to the happy chatter and clatter of eating outIt is the late 1980s, and I am standing, long after dark, in an unlit alley behind the Strand a place seemingly built to enable muggings and furtive snogging. There is a blank doorway here and next to it a small, polished brass plaque. It reads “Joe Allen”. I pause here for a moment, just to draw out my youthful anticipation. When I push through that door, I will be hit by an adrenaline rush of a noise. It’s a sound of which I want to become a part: a babble of happy voices deep into their theatrical anecdotage, overlaid by the clink of glass on glass, the rattle of the cocktail shaker, and all of it underscored by Jimmy Hardwick’s piano.Jimmy arrived at the restaurant when it opened in 1977 as a means to obtain a late licence. He will play here until a month before his death in 2014, aged 88. Jimmy knows the Great American Songbook like popes know the Bible, but also makes sure to nail the score of every new musical as it opens, however poor. He has a tune for the biggest of names who walk through that door, for this is Joe Allen in its pomp, when it is pretty much the only game in town. It is the place the stars come the moment the curtain falls, to help them feel famous. Jimmy doesn’t need to look up to clock Shirley Bassey’s entrance, and then segue into Hey Big Spender, or give Michael Crawford a couple of choruses of something from Phantom. He is an integral part of something more important to the success of Joe’s than its cheery American bistro food or its killer cocktails or its relaxed service. He is a part of that most intangible of restaurant assets: the buzz.At the same time as I was pushing through that door as a punter in the late 80s, Russell Norman was working those tables as a manager. He would eventually rise to be a maître d’ at Joe Allen. Today he is the co-owner of the half-dozen-strong Polpo group of Mediterranean-inspired small-plate restaurants. Early on in the current crisis Russell and I discussed what social distancing would mean for the restaurant business. We talked about 2m rules, and how many seats that would remove. We interrogated the economics of the business in depressingly acute detail. And then he said: “And, of course, atmosphere will disappear.”Mood. Buzz. Atmosphere. Call it what you wish. It’s the one thing most likely to bring us back to a restaurant, and it’s the thing we’ve missed most in lockdown. At home our world is small. Inside restaurants our world is big, however cramped the dining room. Yes, all parts of the business contribute to it: a well-managed bar lubricating the chatter, the prospect of getting your hands (and mouth) on certain dishes, the perfectly calculated emotional geometry of good service. The buzz is all these things but, just as the ingredients of a good stew produce another flavour entirely, it is also so very much itself.“The right restaurant atmosphere,” Russell said, “makes your heart beat a little faster. It makes you want to be in that room. It’s as important and significant a catalyst to appetite as any cocktail or bowl of olives.” He paused. “It’s restaurant foreplay.” If he sounds wistful, it’s because he is. Quite right, too.What atmosphere certainly isn’t is a function of expense. We all know that the more money you spend in a restaurant, the drearier the experience often becomes. Joy is beaten out of you, one tweezered amuse-bouche at a time. There are some fancy places full of pressed linen, polished waiters and barely murmured conversation that feel less like dining rooms than funeral parlours. You go there to be interred, not to be fed.By contrast, I love Tayyabs, the decades-old Pakistani grill house in London’s Whitechapel famed for its spice-crusted tandoori lamb chops and its dry meat curry. While not as cheap as it once was, it’s still great value. When I drift away into a mental image of eating their food, it’s not just the thought of a roasted marinade smearing my cheeks or a smoking, blackened bone in my hands that makes me smile. It’s the memory of clatter and elbows and being barked at by waiters who are focused on seeing how quickly they can get you out rather than being your friend. It is literally managed chaos. I wouldn’t want it any other way.Atmosphere is the no-nonsense bustle of the sit-down fish and chip cafés of Whitby, where the plates heave with huge, curling pieces of haddock like golden, bubbled Venetian gondolas sailing through a surging lake of dripping-fried chips. There, the venerable waiting staff talk in bold print and boast meaty forearms perfectly engineered for the job of carrying. For me it’s the Magpie, with its low-ceilinged dining rooms that are barely able to contain the chatter, but others have their favourites. Or, at the other end of the scale, it’s the downstairs dining room at Richard Corrigan’s Bentley’s off London’s Piccadilly. Pull up to the marble counter. Drink something chilled and watch the oyster shuckers use hard-fisted force to reveal the pristine and delicate. All of that is accompanied by the soundtrack of contented chatter.You can put the necessary parts of a restaurant in place, but you can’t contrive atmosphere. Or to put it another way, restaurant hell is forced fun. Hell is a faux cowboy with a fake bullet belt of shot glasses and holstered bottles of tequila, bellowing “PART-EEEE!!!” and wondering where their life went wrong, as they drift about a Tex-Mex dining room full of miserable diners. Hell is a sound system cranked up so high your ears bleed alongside your steak. Hell is a spare rib selection served in a mini galvanised dustbin for the wow factor because it’s “junk food”. None of this is atmosphere. It’s desperation.The good chefs and restaurateurs know this. They know they aren’t selling plates of roasted beetroot or witty takes on the tarte tatin, although that’s a part of their job. They are selling a really good time. They are selling us the buzz. At some point in the next few weeks and months restaurants like Joe Allen, which is still going strong after 40 years, will unlock their doors. The tables will be laid and the stoves relit. These are all functional things. They are literally doable. Reigniting the buzz in the age of social distancing may prove an awful lot harder.Leading hospitality industry figures, led by Huw Gott of Hawksmoor, have come together to organise an online auction of promises and experiences, with all funds split equally between Hospitality Action and Action Against Hunger. The auction, called Today’s Special, takes place on 1 July and will be hosted by Andi Oliver and Oliver Peyton. Lots include zoom masterclasses with chefs such as Angela Hartnett and Sabrina Ghayour, a bespoke cake by Lili Vannilli, and Sunday lunch cooked in your home by the head chef of the Harwood Arms. Oh, and a drink with me over video chat and a cracking bottle of wine. A donation of £5 secures a place online. For more, visit todays-specialChef Niall McKenna’s Belfast steak house Hadski’s has launched an extensive ‘Cook and Dine menu’ for collection from the restaurant. Naturally, prime cuts feature heavily, including a T-Bone for two, with garlic potatoes, portobello mushrooms and peppercorn sauce for £45, as well as a Sunday roast at £34 for two, including dessert. There are also fish and non-meat options (jamesandco).While recovering from Covid-19, tech developer Peter Rodgers started thinking about solutions to the challenges thrown up by the pandemic for retailers and the hospitality business. The result is a web-based virtual queuing system. The basic account is free to use, with charges for larger businesses. It is, he says, ‘ad-free, has no tracking and is completely anonymous’. Some non-reservation restaurants have already been using text-based queueing systems. It will be interesting to see whether this presents a useful alternative.

Bottura’s wife, Lara, glamorous in white jeans, told a rambling anecdote at the top of her voice. His son, Charlie, somehow ended up with whipped cream on his cheek. His daughter, Alexa, could as usual be heard hurriedly translating her father’s running thoughts from Italian to English. As for the Michelin-starred chef himself, he was in particularly fine voice. “Ragazzi! Ragazzi!” he shouted, trying (and failing) to get everyone’s attention. Italy’s lockdown having finally been eased some days before, however, the mood was also valedictory. Freedom – and work – now beckoned once again: perhaps this would be one of the last times the Botturas would entertain us at home. “This is a real leftovers meal,” Alexa explained, as her dad made an elaborate pile of some dry-looking chocolate breakfast pancakes, a few slices of banana, and a large dollop of preserved cherries.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGazing at this toppling confection, I wondered vaguely if he was taking the piss. But, no. At the stove, more serious work was under way. “Look!” instructed Alexa. “This is a pasta that thinks it is a risotto.” In a pan into which he had crushed some plum tomatoes, Bottura tipped a bag of tiny macaroni – the kind you might usually add to soup. He then added a ladle of broth made from the liquid in which he’d cooked (separately) both some mussels and some pork belly, and stirred. Things, it must be said, did not look terribly promising. In the mix, we could see two pale cloves of garlic, bobbing like white sharks in a blood red sea, and a small, floating tree in the form of a huge bouquet garni. He stirred some more. He added some more broth. And on and on. Finally, he threw in the mussels and pork, a few lumps of cold butter (“to bring down the temperature and to make it creamy!”), and a sprinkling of orange zest, grated from a fruit that was roughly the size of Jupiter, and which had been sent to him by a kind friend in Sicily. Pronto. The pasta was now ready for the table.\u0026nbspTo what culinary rules, if any, did this improbable dish subscribe? I’m still not sure, though pork and mussels are, I know, often eaten together in Spain. But then, Kitchen Quarantine isn’t intended to be what we might call a precision-based venture. Filmed on Alexa’s mobile phone at the family home in Modena (the Italian city that’s also home to Bottura’s three Michelin-starred restaurant, Osteria Francescana), the family’s Instagram series, broadcast nightly throughout Italy’s long and severe lockdown, is a confidence-builder for cooks everywhere – not because it tells us exactly what to do, but because it reminds us that, if we keep things simple, they’ll usually come out all right in the end. A bit of this. A bit of that. Stir, taste, repeat. This is improvisational cooking for dummies – albeit dummies who might have a certain flair for drama and a decent supply of parmesan. To watch Bottura eat cold mozzarella on toasted day-old focaccia is to know that when it comes to food, the good and the elaborate are not necessarily the same thing.\u0026nbspKitchen Quarantine began almost by accident. Stuck at home, and having been furloughed from her job at Maserati, Alexa filmed her father cooking the family’s supper. It was a spur of the moment thing. But then, as she told the New Yorker, she focus-grouped the result on FaceTime. People told her that they liked what they saw and wanted more, so she duly kept going. Thanks to her efforts, the charming, warm, lovable and deeply Italian Bottura family have since become something of an internet sensation: more than half a million people watched the video in which Massimo made béchamel sauce. Last month, he won a special achievement prize at the Webby awards in recognition of this “inspirational” project.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBottura’s shaggy-haired charisma – in spectacles, he looks more like a shrink than a chef – has certainly played a big part in the success of Kitchen Quarantine: who wouldn’t want to be sequestered for a while with so energetic a man? But he’s hardly the only cook to have migrated to the internet. Across the world, restaurants have been closed for weeks, and while in some countries they’re now beginning to reopen – Osteria Francescana is once again taking bookings there will even be, for the first time in its history, tables available on Sundays – in the UK, they’re not expected to reopen until July. With time on their hands, and a desire both to inspire and to remain present in the minds of their customers, where else might professional cooks usefully appear?\u0026nbspThose keen on cookalongs can go high end, and watch other Michelin-starred chefs: you might also like to road test Jason Atherton’s Social Kitchen Isolation (Atherton’s empire includes the Pollen Street Social), in which he makes chicken and leek pies and Thai curries. Or they can go mainstream: the executive chefs of both Wagamama and Nando’s are online now, should you be yearning for a certain kind of katsu curry or peri-peri chicken. My favourites, however, are the demos available from Bread Ahead, the excellent bakery in Borough Market (every day at 2pm an ingredients list is published in advance if you intend to join in) from Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich of Honey \u0026amp Co. (roll your own vine leaves) and from Padella, Tim Siadatan’s genius no-bookings pasta restaurant (though he posts less frequently than some, the good news is that his demo of perfect pici cacio e pepe is already up). But whether high or low(er), these offerings all have one thing in common. What’s great about them is that unlike, say, cookery shows on TV, there’s no padding or guff any cosiness is real, not staged. And herein lies the secret of their infectious accessibility. Direct and intimate, you absorb small tricks of the trade without even realising it.\u0026nbspBut if videos aren’t your thing, there are other options. I love Home Cooking, a podcast by Samin Nosrat, the American cook best known for the Netflix series based on her book Salt Fat Acid Heat: especially the fourth episode, in which she and her co-host, Hrishikesh Hirway, discuss everything from chocolate mousse to what to do with a surfeit of ginger, after which they’re joined by special guest Yo Yo Ma (listening to him talk about the Parisian bakeries of his childhood is wonderful – almost, though not quite, as good as listening to him play Bach’s complete cello suites). Or maybe you prefer to read. In the wake of Covid-19, several new platforms for food writing have sprung up, among them Vittles, a “food newsletter for novel times”, whose contributors include Ruby Tandoh, and In Digestion, a weekly survey of the best food media on the web “and why you should care about it”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe overall effect of this mass shift to the internet is, broadly speaking, one of democratisation. Not only is all this information free. The playing field is more level: whether a cook is young and little known, or older and long-established, they’re all using the same means to get across their message. In lockdown, moreover, everyone is muddling through, even the most skilled among us: Srulovich seems to approach his fridge just as trepidatiously as the rest of us right now – which is reassuring. It’s not that perfection has been consigned to the past rather, that it has been redefined. It is messy and human. When Bottura was making his risotto-style pasta, a rogue mussel landed in his pan ahead of the others. For a while, he did not notice (I felt like I was watching a panto: “Look!” I wanted to shout. “It’s there, behind that tomato!”). When he finally did spot it, though, he was eager to point it out. “If my clumsiness doesn’t worry me, why should yours worry you?” he seemed to be saying, prodding the alien mollusc with his wooden spoon. In this world, a shrug is everything. It may be more reassuring even than knowing your weighing scales are accurate and to hand.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI have to admit that there are days lately when my laptop is a very useful bit of kitchen kit. But I’m not entirely convinced this shift will be permanent. Or perhaps I mean that I hope it won’t be. If there’s joy in all this cooking, there’s melancholy in it, too. It reminds us powerfully of what we miss. For one thing, where are all the people? Who, I sometimes ask myself, am I doing all this cooking for? How good it would be to have people round, to hear them coo over my star anise-scented chicken pilaff and my salted chocolate blondies (my two great triumphs so far).\u0026nbspFor another, there are our shuttered restaurants, about which, with every day that passes, I worry more. We miss them a lot, whether Pizza Express or… well, think of your own favourite: that beloved place that you turn to first for comfort or celebration. It is said that people are trying to replicate restaurant experiences at home, and I think there’s truth in this. Those serious restaurants that have ploughed their efforts into home delivery are doing brisk trade, even if this cannot, for their owners, begin to make up what they are losing financially: I’m planning to order from Orasay, Jackson Boxer’s marvellous London fish restaurant, for my birthday next month. I’ve also taken to replicating, as others also have, certain restaurant twiddles at home. The other night, I put a load of chips (oven chips!) in a newspaper cone, which I then placed inside a pewter tankard that belonged to my dad – a stab at making us feel we were eating our goujons of sole in a certain swanky West End place rather than in our basement kitchen.\u0026nbspIn truth, I’ve had enough both of my screen and of my own cooking for now. Food and people: they cannot, and should not, be separated. I long to be out in the world again. I long for the clatter of cutlery, and the sound of strangers laughing for the good-humoured crush of a bar, and the murmured approval of a maître d’. I want a wine list, even if it is overpriced, and napkins as big as sails. I want a little pat of butter, and a basket full of warm bread. I want proper chips, and I want pudding, even if I’m full. I want to run for the bus afterwards feeling slightly tipsy, and go to bed thinking of whatever delicious thing it was that I ate – a dish made with love and skill and with which I had no involvement whatsoever save for the fact that I willingly scoffed it all down.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47bd915580a51a85d7ec982bcfb81c7ef98e3c8c/0_62_2208_1325/master/2208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cedec0a8a63bbc3d28729f8ceb480f5","title":"glasgow city champions league wolfsburg tough task even harder","story":"The club are not yet back in training and face a struggle to arrange friendlies and Covid-19 testing before facing WolfsburgGlasgow City already needed to summon their inner David to outwit Goliath-like Champions League quarter-final opponents, Wolfsburg, but now the odds are even further against the Scottish champions.Uefa has announced the remaining eight Champions League teams will play a straight knockout tournament at the San Mamés stadium in Bilbao and the Anoeta stadium in San Sebastián.It is welcome news after the curtailment of the majority of European women’s leagues that there will be women’s football in August, and Glasgow City’s general manager and co-founder, Laura Montgomery, says Uefa “have done the best they can do to get the games played, which pretty much everyone is desperate for”.It does present clubs with a variety of challenges though.The two-times European champions Wolfsburg, who clinched their fourth consecutive Frauen-Bundesliga title with a 2-0 over Freiburg on Wednesday, and Bayern Munich, who will play the reigning champions, Lyon, have benefited from being the only two remaining teams to have had their domestic league resume.“I do have a giggle sometimes when I see us in the quarter-finals with these giants and all the money that sits around them,” Montgomery says. “That’s what it’s about though, there’s some romance in seeing us there. We’ve got a huge hill to climb in drawing Wolfsburg in the first place.”Unlike Lyon, who are similarly disadvantaged, Glasgow are “still significantly far away from returning to training of any description”.Montgomery adds: “Even if we can meet all the protocols to get back training we’re not going to have anyone to play against because no other team in Scotland is back or can afford to be back.With the manager, Scott Booth, keen to have the players for four to six weeks, Montgomery is working towards an early-July return to training. The biggest barrier to meeting the protocols required to return is the cost of testing.“We’re working with our facility provider because essentially you have to create a bio-hub for a return to training,” Montgomery says. “So we’re preparing as best we can but without a doubt the cost of the testing is our biggest challenge. It’s just astronomical. It’s astronomical for the top level of our men’s game, it’s been a prohibitive measure for some of those teams coming back, but we don’t have any other option we have to find a way and as Glasgow City we usually do. For the integrity of our game here we simply have to do everything to get ourselves to Spain to play this quarter-final.”Glasgow City, founded in 1998, have held their own as an independent club and sealed a 13th consecutive league title last November. Hibernian and now Celtic and Rangers have invested in their women’s teams to try to end the dominance of a club who have reached the top pioneering sustainability.With lockdown kicking in one game into the season and sponsorships not in before then, Montgomery has been working towards “plugging the gap”. There has not been direct financial help offered, but Uefa is attempting to mitigate the damage done by playing this mini-tournament in Spain.“As clubs we’ve all lost our home gates and match sponsorship opportunities, we’ve lost our advertising opportunities, we’ve lost third-party broadcasting rights,” Montgomery says.Uefa is allowing clubs to honour existing domestic exclusivity broadcast deals, but clubs will lose the ability to sell rights beyond their own shores as the European governing body attempts to maximise reach.“I’m guessing we’ll probably be behind on what we would have projected previously but it is dependent on a lot of things. How many of the fans that have bought a ticket will want their money back? If a lot of fans don’t that massively helps us if a lot of fans do want a refund that’s got thousands of pounds attached.”Less of a problem for Glasgow, because they had to deal with it in March, is the issue of players being out of contract or leaving. “The other clubs are now facing a problem that we faced months ago,” says Montgomery. “I’m going to be honest, we’ll probably, at best, have 18 first-team players because we just don’t have enough that were signed by that March date. It’s clearly affecting all the clubs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e3abddf22d4a4b2b88a53ffcb75102f43336113/181_360_4246_2549/master/4246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d486f3fda3c1653e626fe68ebe1ab8e","title":"trent alexander arnold joins calls for racism action black lives matter liverpool everton","story":"The Liverpool and England defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has called for action against structural racism in an impassioned post on social media.“The system is broken, it’s stacked against sections of our society and we all have a responsibility to fix it. Black people are viewed differently. We face discrimination in actions but also in thought. It’s more than just violence and abuse. Opportunity in life is restricted if you look a certain way. How can that be in 2020?“We are prejudged on skin colour rather than character and personality,” the 21-year-old added. “We then have to prove these misconceptions wrong! Why? Why is it my responsibility to correct an ignorant perception? Sadly, so many in the black community have to face this each and every day.”Alexander-Arnold posted the message alongside a picture of the boots, which he will wear in the Merseyside derby on Sunday evening. The boots will then be auctioned to raise money for the Nelson Mandela Foundation, a charity Alexander-Arnold praised for “incredible work in striving for freedom and equality for all.”“I also have hope,” he added. “Hope that the world is awake in this moment. Finally willing to learn. So while we have this opportunity, where people are listening – let’s speak, educate, campaign and let’s promote the message that better education brings change.“This is the moment of change. This is the moment to say enough is enough. This is the moment to make sure it stops now. Racism is a fire that is now burnt out.”Alexander-Arnold also discussed the Black Lives Matter movement with Rio Ferdinand in a BT Sport interview broadcast on Saturday. The defender discussed the racial abuse he received at Old Trafford last October, and said he had been inspired to speak out against racism by the impact of his England colleagues, Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling.“I want to make sure I’m educating people,” Alexander-Arnold said. “I know I’ve got a big profile, I’m a role model for the younger generation. I want to put out messages that I believe in. I want kids to look at me and think ‘he’s got the right values. I want to be like that.’ I want to look back at the end of my career and feel like I’ve made a change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382ad11d851b17747df8679a20c963e5fc1148f4/0_200_3475_2086/master/3475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3cf17675da64fbf24d99962dab13ef7","title":"cardiff city v leeds united championship live","story":"Junior Hoilett and Robert Glatzel made the most of mistakes from Leeds to earn Cardiff the pointsThanks for joining me! Have a cracking Sunday.Even if Leeds did get promoted you’d think they would have to do quite a bit of business to have an impact in the Premier League, which could be tricky in the current climate.If you want more football ...“We knew they would have the majority of possession. We stayed compact, made it hard to play through us and hit them on the counter,” Junior Hoilett explains.You can say that again.Leeds might be out of sight at the top of the table by now if they had a striker more suited to their style. Bamford just looks a little lost up top but maybe I am being harsh.Leeds miss out on going back to the top of the table, while Cardiff move up to seventh. That win will give Harris’ men even greater confidence that they can reach the playoffs.Cardiff did the intelligent thing of taking their chances when they arose. Leeds certainly played the better but the Welsh side just had a more pragmatic approach, aided by the visitors gifting the two chances which led to the goals. Bielsa will be doing some head scratching later. 90+4 mins: Pinball in the Cardiff box results in Harrison firing a bouncing ball at goal from five yards out but he sends it high and wide. 90+2 mins: Harrison fires in a cross but it is deflected behind for a corner. Phillips sends in the corner but Nelson heads clear. The ball makes it back into the box, Roberts goes down but the referee is having none of it. 89 mins: Poveda digs out a cross, which takes a deflection towards goal and spins just in front of Smithies who cannot collect. Luckily, for Cardiff, Morrison is in the right place to boot it off the line. 88 mins: Phillips lifts the ball over the defence for Bamford to chase but his outstretched leg just cannot reach the ball. A deeply frustrating game for the Leeds striker. 86 mins: Cardiff now have two left-backs on to face up to Dallas and Poveda, where they see Leeds’ threat coming from. Poveda sends a dangerous ball through into the box but no one in a Leeds shirt can get on the end of it.84 mins: Gotts is on for Leeds, replacing Klich. 82 mins: Klich pulls back Bacuna when the Cardiff make looked to be heading through on goal. Needless to say, the Leeds man has been booked.Leeds break, with the ball getting to Harrison in the area but Sanderson reads what the winger is trying to do and dispossesses him. 80 mins: Leeds try to work something down the right but they seem to have lost a little edge and Cardiff easily remove the danger. 77 mins: Former Manchester City kid Poveda comes on, replacing Costa. It will be interesting to see if he is capable of changing things. 75 mins: Cardiff fail to clear their lines, with Costa collecting the loose ball in the box, he makes space for himself but scuffs his shot. Ralls is replaced by Pack in midfield. 73 mins: Leeds’ greatest strength has become their weakness in this game, with sloppy passes leading to both goals. 69 mins: Another drinks break. Bielsa has 20 minutes or so to get his players going again. 67 mins: Glatzel holds it up well before laying it off to Ralls but the midfielder’s shot goes well wide.Digvijay asks: “Out of curiosity, if you were a fan of a club in the PL that got relegated, would you watch them home and away in the Championship?”No, I work a lot of weekends.65 mins: Bamford combines with Costa, who then sends it back to the striker but he cannot control the pass, instead shinning it to the goalkeeper. A frustrating day for the Leeds striker.A double change for Cardiff as Mendez-Laing and Glatzel, replace Paterson and Adomah.63 mins: Bielsa’s first roll of the dice is to replace Ayling with Alioski. 61 mins: WHAT A SAVE! Dallas lifts the ball to the back post for Bamford to knock down to Roberts who charges in and smashes a shot from two yards but Smithies sprints across his line before ing in front of the shot. 59 mins: Bamford really not bringing much to the party here. He hangs around the box but does not really look like he is going to score. Bielsa must long for the days of having Toquero at Athletic Bilbao. 57 mins: Bacuna takes the ball 50 yards up the pitch but is caught by a trailing leg, resulting in Roberts being booked. Mick McCarthy questions whether Lee Tomlin will be as fit as his teammates following lockdown. His reputation goes before him, it would seem. 55 mins: Paterson is now down after being caught on the back of his head by Ayling when jumping for a header. 53 mins: Paterson has his first chance of the match thanks to a lovely Ralls cross but the striker’s header goes wide. 51 mins: Costa curls in a dangerous low cross from the right with his left foot but it misses everyone and squirms away for a goal kick. More frustration for Leeds.49 mins: A few robust challenges culminate with three players being left on the turf. Impressively, no one has been booked.JR is feeling optimistic: “We’re top of the league, top of the leeeeaaaague, West Bromwich Albion, we’re top of the league! I might regret that by the time this game is over but if there’s one thing I’ve learned about supporting a football club is that you have to take every chance to taunt andor denigrate everyone who supports another club.“As for Adomah’s yellow, it was because he almost kicked Dallas’s head off, not because Dallas pretended he got kicked. Now Helder Costa, he should have been booked for ing when he got himself in front of Bennett and threw himself to the ground.“Hang on you Bluebirds!”47 mins: If Cardiff win this 4-0, then they will go into the playoff sport but I suspect they would be ecstatic with three points regardless. Here we go again!Peter Harris says: “Pretty churlish stuff. They didn’t foul their way to the goal . They’ve been very well behaved and Adomah’s booking came about from a piece of acting by Dallas.”For your listening pleasure ...Cardiff do not deserve to be ahead but they have taken their one chance of the match, while Leeds have struggled overall in the final third. There might be a few Leeds fans biting nails already.45+1 mins: OH NO! Roberts flashes a cross into the box, Harrison sends it towards the bottom corner but Bamford is in the way, blocking a certain goal on the line. The assistant then compounds the matter by pointing out that the striker is offside. Not a great few seconds.45 mins: Harrison belatedly wins a free-kick after being caught by Sanderson. Phillips whips in the set-piece from the left wing but he fails to beat the first man. 43 mins: YELLOW! Adomah is done for a high boot on Dallas. The winger was looking to control the ball before the defender but the referee called it right. Hoilett is booked seconds later for pulling back Ayling.41 mins: Bielsa must be very excited at the prospect of being able to make five subs in the game. 39 mins: Cardiff will just be looking to hold this lead until the break as the visitors are looking to increase the tempo once again.37 mins: YELLOW! Costa goes into the book for catching Bennett with the shoulder when jumping for the ball. Bennett needs treatment due to his head injury.Phillips gives the ball away on the halfway line, Hoilett picks it up, dribbles towards the box and fires a shot from 18 yards which flies into the net. It’s fair to say Cardiff do not deserve the lead.34 mins: Costa shows some trickery and earns a corner. Leeds are really dominating here. All they need to do now is threaten the goal!

Norwood curls it in and Lascelles heads clear.30 min Joelinton has an impromptu row with Egan. It was all a bit pointless, and both players are booked.29 min Almiron heads the ball past the last man Egan, who struggles desperately to stay with him. Eventually Almiron goes over in the area and the referee waves play on. There was a slight pull of the shirt from Egan, no more than that.27 min Matt Ritchie has looked really bright in the first half hour. Newcastle missed him so much between August and January.22 min “Dear Rob,” says Oliver Lewis. “Not having watched all that much Sheffield United this season, has it been commented on how pleasant on the ear the combination of Basham, Baldock, and Berge are when the commentators say their names as they pass to each other, like some slightly dodgy law firm.”20 min Shelvey’s long-range shot is charged down by Egan. Newcastle have been excellent in the last 10 minutes.17 min Joelinton misses an excellent chance. He ran through on goal after a fine pass from Almiron, but the closer he got to Henderson, the less assured he looked. Eventually he tried to open his body and steer the ball across Henderson, but made a hash of it. The ball dribbled into Henderson’s hands and Joelinton fell on his face.13 min Ritchie’s fierce 30-yard shot is pushed away by the flying Henderson. It was a good save, though one he’d expect to make.12 min McBurnie’s header, from Baldock’s cross, bounces gently through to Dubravka.10 min Almiron’s dangerous low cross towards Joelinton is put behind by Basham. Ritchie’s corner leads to a helluva scramble in the six-yard box before Sheffield United clear. Moments later, Saint-Maximin beats Stephens with a lovely stepover but his cutback is missed by Almiron (I think).9 min Sheffield United are dominating the game, with Newcastle struggling to get out of their half at the moment.6 min Norwood’s big, inswinging corner from the left just evades the leaping Robinson at the far post. It’s been a decent start from Sheffield United.5 min Baldock zips between Saint-Maximin and Rose and is fouled. Fleck’s inswinging free-kick is headed away by Shelvey.4 min Nothing to report yet. The fake crowd are in excellent voice though.1 min Peep peep! Newcastle, in black and white stripes, kick off from right to left. Sheffield United are in red and white stripes.The players are out on the field. It’s a cloudy afternoon in St James’ Park, very pleasant conditions for football.“Hey Rob,” says J.R. “Wouldn’t the Aston Villa v Sheffield United game four days ago qualify in the both-managers-in-charge-of-their-boyhood-club-derby category?”Yes, yes it would. “But just imagine when Robbie Keane becomes a manager. Every club he’ll be in charge of will have been his boyhood club. I’m here all week.”Hello. During lockdown, Newcastle United became a moral compass, with endless chat about the rights and wrongs of their proposed takeover by a Saudi-based consortium. This afternoon, they revert to being a football club. This fixture at home to Sheffield United is their first since the 1-0 win at Southampton on 7 March, a game which, if I am to be honest, I had completely forgotten about.That win moved Newcastle very close to safety, a fine effort from Steve Bruce given the limitations of his squad and the pathetic abuse he received at the start of the season. If he has had a good season, Chris Wilder has ejoyed a spectacular one. Sheffield United will move up to fifth if they win today, a level of overachievement that verges on the surreal.This match is an endearing rarity, with both managers in charge of their boyhood club. I don’t have all the data to hand, or indeed any of it, but I can’t imagine that has happened too often in the Premier League era."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a2e0faf67f20dba3949fc27387106fb3199cf02/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32efafbf2a14be03fcc80cca205e71ce","title":"share your reviews of the last of us part ii","story":"The sequel to Naughty Dog’s hit video game is finally here, but what did you make of it?

At one point, because of Covid restrictions, we weren’t sure I would be allowed in the birthing room. Then, Sara and Abid had to spend five days in the hospital alone after the birth. Fatherhood makes you super protective. It’s frightening, but I feel complete. I feel so responsible, but I feel so much love. There is a gravitational connection that pulls you towards your child. I worry, I check up on him in the night – and it puts everything else in my life into perspective.Sara and I live with my parents. The multigenerational set-up works and especially when you have a child. It’s so interesting being part of this club now. I see a completely different side to my own dad than I’m used to seeing. He’s always really sweet and caring with his grandkids. It’s nice to see him relaxed – he’s lovely. He didn’t have that sort of time when we were growing up.My dad is a classic success story, a Pakistani immigrant who came here with nothing and worked his way up. He always instilled hard work into his kids and we get that from him. Being at home and furloughed for a couple of months means I’ve been able to be really present. It’s also opened my eyes to parents or families when one person has to stay at home and the other has to work, it’s not easy.Father’s Day is a chilled one for us, we’re a tight-knit family and my brother and sister come over with my nieces and nephews and I usually cook lunch. My wife has been teasing me, telling me to buy my own card seeing as I’m going to the shops anyway. I do love being a dad, there’s not a moment when I’m not in love with him. My camera roll used to be screenshots of future holidays or furniture Sara and I want to buy, now I keep scrolling and it’s just pictures of him.Nat Davies, 39, digital editor, lives in north London. She lost her father, Richard Davies, six years agoDad was a pretty mercurial character. He was extraordinarily gifted and won a scholarship to study art at the Royal Academy at 15, but his dad wanted him to get a trade. So he studied graphic design in Cardiff. He had his own business when I was growing up and I remember him in his shiny 80s suit, driving a Nissan Sunny to his offices in a warehouse. For a couple of years he was a single dad, it was just me and him before he met my stepmum and my sisters came along. I think that’s partly why our bond was so strong.Richard was really handsome, charming and talented. Draw your own conclusions, but there were a lot of glamorous women at his funeral ,weeping and telling us they were sorry, and we had no clue who they were. He had a bit of a drinking problem and took recreational drugs but not in a shady, crackhead way. He always had this glamorous, bohemian side and he’d met his heroes – Hendrix, the Beatles, the Stones – running around as an art student in Cardiff.When I was 16, he got cancer. The next few years were horrible. He became really angry and occasionally violent. He was getting chemotherapy when he insisted I go to university, and I felt huge guilt but I also couldn’t wait to escape. He did recover from cancer but his life was in tatters and his marriage collapsed. I think his mind was shot, his emotions were everywhere and he was full of rage.I had to confront him with a lot of his behaviour and said I’d stop speaking to him. At that point, he got counselling and that’s when he changed – he started painting again, he met a new partner. We went on holidays together, he’d show me his poems. Those last eight years of his life we had an incredible relationship again. I could tell him anything, and we saw each other regularly.Father’s Day was a big occasion for us. All my sisters and I would go for dinner with him back home and he would cry at every card. He became a big softie. I was at a loss to know what to do this year. I haven’t been able to see my sisters since February. I might share some drawings from his old sketchbooks and try and celebrate him.He was 67 when he died with complications from flu. The first few years are the hardest, they’re just so sad and you just don’t know how you’ll cope. Dad was my person and he loved me so much. The day-in, day-outness of living without him is the hard thing. I don’t think I’ll ever be loved like that by anyone else again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb5380f215e02ae386f6586e757a85f1d815169/0_76_919_551/master/919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4321cb5bd00c7e696129884a7a7052a9","title":"family chefs restaurateurs following fathers footsteps","story":"To celebrate Father’s Day, Jess and Richie Corrigan, Nathan Outlaw and Missy Malik-Flynn talk about how their upbringings influenced their career choicesRichard Corrigan is an Irish chef and restaurateur whose restaurants in London have included Bentley’s Oyster Bar \u0026amp Grill, Corrigan’s Mayfair and Daffodil Mulligan.

Going into the same industry as your father, you always have an advantage: the contacts, you know how it all works, and how to talk to chefs.Jess: I’ve seen the highs and lows of running a restaurant business. When I became senior in restaurant PR I realised the benefit of that, when I had to deal with situations I’d dealt with in my personal life. Dad came from nothing, so I don’t think we were spoilt. We had amazing opportunities but he always reminded us how fortunate we were. If I wanted to go on holiday with my friends or get a new album, I had to work for that money.Jess: It was a hard opening. There was Dad, there was Richie as general manager, and I was doing the PR. So we’d have a meeting, and Dad wouldn’t show, and Richie would be doing something else, and I would be there with my team. With any other client, I would have sat there patiently. But with them, I was like: “Guys, sit down, we’re having this meeting.” I thought it was a normal meeting and it went quite well. And on the tube afterwards, the team was in a state of shock and said: “The three of you were just shouting at each other across the table.” A lot was agreed on in that meeting, but there was a lot of table slamming. I definitely ran that account differently. In a normal situation, I would put something to the client and talk them through it, but I skip that step with Dad or Richie.\u0026nbspRichie: I have a lot of autonomy but Dad’s a big character, so he’d come in and say, “I want it this way and that way,” and I had real trouble speaking to him like an owner, not like my dad. So I’d say, “Oh, I disagree with you,” and he’d say, “Well, tough shit.” I’m not sure how I’d react if a normal boss said that to me. So we did have shouting matches. It was all about business, but I’m not sure I would have shouted with another boss. I’ve worked for quite tough people and if they said “Jump”, I’d say, “How high?” if Dad says “Jump”, I say, “Why are you asking me to jump, what’s the reasoning behind that?” So you question things more, but there aren’t so many steps of management, so the end goal is quicker to get to. But we definitely take work home with us – there’s no choice.Jess: There are times we want to kill each other. Richie and I not so much.\u0026nbspRichie: Some general managers want to micromanage PR, but I trust Jess. So we haven’t fallen out. We team up against Dad.\u0026nbspJess: He’s cooking at home every night now. It’s what he loves. And he has not a lot going on. Nearly every night he says he gets so much enjoyment out of seeing us eating. Sometimes Robbie, our brother, will have only one portion and Dad’s like: “What’s wrong? Do you not like it? You need more.” Anyone in the industry will tell you, if you go to one of his restaurants and he’s there, you’ll leave very full and very drunk.\u0026nbspRichie: It’s too much. It’s one of the arguments I’ve had with him. I’ll say: “They’ve had enough. Stop giving them food.” He’ll give them another course.Jess: Or if people say they aren’t drinking that month, he’s like: “Don’t be ridiculous! Bottle of champagne!” I’m sure they love it, but as his kids, we’re just like: “Oh my God, leave these poor people alone.” His generosity is renowned.Richie: And extends to our home.When Nathan Outlaw was young, his father, Clive, was the head of catering at a paper mill. Nathan now owns Restaurant Nathan Outlaw and Outlaw’s Fish Kitchen in Cornwall. He also runs Siren at the Goring Hotel in London, currently closed due to coronavirus, where Clive also worked.nathan-outlawEven when I was about eight, I wanted to go with my dad to his kitchen. They were an unruly team and it seemed like they were just having fun. I suppose everyone was nice to me because I was the boss’s son, but they’d show me everything and include me, so straightaway I felt at home. I remember how upbeat Dad was when they’d been very busy. He must have been coming off the high of enjoying himself – and very proud of what he was doing. Even when I was young, seeing someone with that positivity for work really rubbed off.I’d go in for the breakfast shift on Saturdays. There’d be 200 to 300 in the canteen, and there was the directors’ dining, which was a bit posher. They also had a dance hall and would do social things most Saturday nights – bands and comedians. I used to get involved in that, too, collecting rubbish or drinks. I never questioned that, I just remember wanting to be there with Dad. I’m lucky he included me. That’s when I got into cooking, and never really thought about doing anything else.I did work experience for him as a teenager and he was so hard on me. He didn’t mind me wanting to be a chef, but he wanted me to realise how tough it was. That six weeks’ summer holiday when all my mates were off playing football and dossing, I was in the kitchen and any time I got near to doing a nice job, he’d tell me to wash up or clean the fryers. They’d make 40 lasagnes – 10 portions a tray – and the trays would go a bit rusty and I had to clean them. All the really crap jobs.\u0026nbspHe taught me, unconsciously, how to run a kitchen and lead people. It didn’t matter what the challenge was, he’d always make it happen. It was fast-paced and the job had to be done properly or not at all, but he made sure that the fun element was as important as getting the job done.\u0026nbspFor the last years of his career he worked for a contract catering company. Those businesses are about the money they want you to cook by numbers and they don’t want you to have a brain or a voice. He had so much he could pass on, I asked if he wanted to come and work with us in London.\u0026nbspHe wasn’t a fine-dining chef, and wasn’t there to be a head chef – he was there for his experience and as a good pair of eyes for me, because I’m based in Cornwall. His organisational experience and passion for cooking was very infectious – especially for the younger guys. There’s a lot of noise in hospitality for young chefs that’s quite hard for them to decipher it’s good to have older chefs in the kitchen to give them perspective.\u0026nbspI try to have a wide knowledge base in all my kitchens. It’s my responsibility to nurture talent, because it was done for me. Accountants would say, only have people in there who can do the job, but I’d rather have a few in the kitchen or front of house who are learning. And people at the mid-level of their career need to learn to lead and nurture, because it’s a tough industry with fewer people coming in, so that’s a valuable skill.\u0026nbspDad came up to London on the train from Maidstone, from 8am until 4pm, and he did the pastries, breads and the afternoon tea stuff. When we closed the restaurant because of the current crisis, he was 65 and he retired a few months early. Hopefully he has the last years of his career as fond memories, instead of working in that faceless corporate company. I’m glad that I was in a position to be able to give him that, like he gave me a nice start.Missy Malik-Flynn’s father, Carl, was a pub manager, then a live-in landlord. She grew up above pubs such as the Marquis of Granby in London’s Covent Garden and the King’s Arms in Hampton Court. With her partner, Gabriel Pryce, Flynn opened Rita’s in Hackney, and now owns sandwich shop Bodega Rita’s in King’s Cross, currently operating as a wine shop and deli. She is also working on an MA on the anthropology of food.\u0026nbspritasdiningI tell people who come to work for us about the first time I got drunk, because it’s how I came to learn about stocktaking. When you’re a kid and live in a pub with all this stuff, you don’t understand who it belongs to, or what business is. When I was a teenager we lived in a pub in South Kensington and we had a dumb waiter that went from the bar, where we could order chips, into our apartment. We had Christmas Day in the pub and I had this elaborate plan of sending my presents up in the lift, and sneaking a Bacardi Breezer into each bag of presents. I got upstairs, got drunk and got in trouble. My mum, who doesn’t drink, was very angry. My dad let the whole telling-off happen then took me aside and said: “I just want you to know, we have CCTV – and we stocktake.” I didn’t understand that there was a record of stock somewhere. That’s when I realised we lived in my dad’s job.\u0026nbspI haven’t done any other work in my life I went straight into working in bars. I worked in the pub as soon as I was allowed, on weekends at the King’s Arms, where we did huge numbers. I did all the menial jobs and really enjoyed the physicality and teamwork.\u0026nbspDad does try to give me advice but he’s got quite old-school reference points. His main thing is stock. He understands the numbers inside out, so every time I get a project he’ll say: “What’s the break even? How much are you going to charge for it?” He grills me on things that are second nature to him. And he’ll lecture me if he thinks I’m doing them wrong.\u0026nbspA lot of what we do is not to his style. He once came to Rita’s in Hackney, and left an online review and – I don’t think he realised how weird it was for him to do this – he complained about the price of the beer, and left it with his full name. You invite your parents and you want them to go and write some fluff…When you work for a pub group, you’re very target driven – all business should be – but Dad never neglected to create micro-communities. Often people who worked there would live with us, and we pretty much had an open door policy. We’d make friends with complete nutters in the pub – it was so much fun. I was always very clear that I wanted to create something with substance and value and longevity. The convivial aspects of running a food business are the best bits, but they don’t work unless the numbers work.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13f835f60a27d33c7bc9868b3af02acc732df720/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6e83e2caff6de397f9895d98b03d32c","title":"smile could the pandemic lead to happier times laurie santos professor of happiness yale","story":"What lessons can we learn from Laurie Santos, the Yale professor whose ‘happiness’ course became a global hit? And could the current health crisis lead to a wellbeing revolution?In January 2018, a Yale University professor named Laurie Santos launched a course, Psychology and the Good Life, which quickly became the most popular class in the institution’s 319-year-history. After 13 years at Yale, in 2016, the 44-year-old had taken charge of one of the university’s residential colleges and had become alarmed by widespread mental illness and stress. She wanted to explain the paradox of why so many students were still suffering, having achieved their dreams of being admitted to Yale and having met society’s definition of success. Santos created the lecture series in a bid to teach her students what really mattered – to help them carve out lives of meaning and contentment.Within a few days of the course’s launch, roughly a quarter of Yale’s entire undergraduate population had signed up. Administrators struggled to find space to accommodate everyone having filled the university’s church, they set up an overflow room for students to watch Santos by screen, before moving her to a large concert hall. Standing behind a lectern on the auditorium’s stage, she questioned much of what the students had been taught to crave: good grades, prestigious jobs, high salaries. With her message that we should step back from ceaseless competition, question our priorities and savour our days, she had clearly tapped into a deep hunger for another way of viewing life.A few months later, in March 2018, Santos launched a 10-week online version of the original happiness course that anyone could access. In the class, called The Science of Well-Being, Santos teaches us why we chase things that make us miserable and, through homework tasks, suggests how we can change our behaviours. She begins with this message: “This is the kind of thing that we really hope can actually change your life.” The course became a major hit half a million online learners enrolled in the two years up to March. But after Covid-19 struck, it became even more popular: more than 2.6m students have now enrolled, from more than 200 countries. At the beginning of the course, Santos issues a warning: “You are about to learn that everything you thought was important for being happy isn’t.”There has been much recent discussion about how the pandemic might fuel political and social changes, about whether or not reduced travel and clearer skies will have increased our desire to protect the environment, or if new government welfare schemes will have popularised universal basic income and a world with less work. But we are also asking questions about the way we live inidually. For all the mental suffering and loss this pandemic has brought, there’s a chance that we could emerge from it with a clearer sense of how we want to spend our days, how we might live happier and more meaningful lives. For many, the question now is: will we be able to make enduring behaviour changes when it ends?Santos has spent this spring inside the Yale college where she lives and works. When we spoke last month, she told me it had been eerily quiet. Graduation had been cancelled and only the few students who couldn’t return to their home countries remained, along with the foxes and squirrels that had descended on to the empty campus. She had recently run a live question and answer session as part of her online course, where people asked her advice on issues ranging from how to deal with annoying spouses to facing job losses. She’d also led webinars for corporates and was making new episodes for her podcast series on happiness.Then there’s the barrage of daily emails her newfound fandom has brought, many of them outlining intense pain and seeking advice. She’d been trying to stay sane through Zoom spa evenings and yoga with her friends, as well as catch-ups with college roommates. “Tragically, I think the pandemic is good for business,” she said.Santos never planned to become a global happiness phenomenon. In fact, she comes across as slightly reserved, not the kind of person who would chase fame. At Yale, her main psychology research involves studying animals to better understand how humans copy each other, draw moral conclusions and make decisions. But as she got to know her students better, her focus began to shift. Some media commentators were dismissing campus mental health problems as the whining of a privileged “snowflake generation”, but Santos was unconvinced by this view. She saw the suffering as symbolic of deeper societal problems.I studied – and taught undergraduates – at Yale before Santos’s course began and saw first-hand how the culture there fuels and embodies many of the modern world’s harmful extremes, such as burnout, overwork and chasing extrinsic recognition. It’s a place where people are high achieving, but also time-starved and stressed-out. Their success, too often, comes at a cost. Underpinning it is an ambition that can be obsessive, unhealthy and, in some cases, lethal – a warped belief that people are valuable only because of their professional potential.What, then, is Santos’s answer to a better life? First, she suggests we’ve been misled in chasing many of the things we do: possessions, beauty, even perhaps marriage. She points to a string of studies to explain her view, including work by Princeton researchers showing that, after a certain point (around $75,000 in the US), money doesn’t increase happiness and emotional wellbeing. She also references papers suggesting that weight loss and cosmetic surgery may not lead to increases in happiness, as well as research showing how salary goals keep rising as we earn more money, which means we may never feel we are making enough. We compare ourselves to others, and therefore will likely continue endlessly wanting more.Becoming aware of all this may not be enough, though. Santos’s own research has pointed out that knowledge plays only a small role in how we make decisions habits and an ability to regulate our emotions have much more influence on happiness. She also says our brains often deceive us, including when we feel strong urges. We may feel we want something – more money, a new coat, cupcakes – though it might not actually bring us much pleasure. And we often don’t crave the simple things we might enjoy more, like relaxing in nature or hanging out with friends. Becoming happier, therefore, routinely requires us to ignore our impulses.“We have these intuitions about happiness that are wrong,” Santos tells me. Our brains aren’t necessarily built to improve our mood. They’re still wired like they were centuries ago, to prioritise escaping predators and immediate threats.As part of her course, Santos prescribes weekly “rewirement challenges”, where she asks students to take a (scientific) leap of faith and commit to new behaviours. These include starting conversations with strangers, getting enough sleep and writing gratitude letters to friends. Another of her challenges is called negative visualisation in which people imagine bad things happening, like family members dying or losing their homes. It seeks to make us more grateful and combat what psychologists call hedonic adaptation, which is the tendency to get used to changes in our lives so that our wants and expectations keep rising. Some of these techniques might sound like wellness caricatures, but Santos insists there’s scientific research to suggest they all work.Is it really possible to increase happiness? Suffering is an inescapable fact of living and no lecture series could hope to solve all human struggles. But Santos does believe we can successfully fight against our negative, destructive tendencies. That’s what we’ve been trying to do for centuries – from Aristotle’s idea that happiness depends on carving out virtuous habits, to the Buddhist notion that controlling craving can reduce suffering. Santos is searching for empirical proof, often from other researchers, that these techniques work and is putting a modern, scientific, spin on them. She’s currently compiling data from students who’ve taken the course. Generally, she says, they do report increases on wellbeing measures at the end.There’s also a debate to be had about the extent to which our happiness is limited by the society we live in. In the last few decades, data suggests attitudes on what we find important have flipped where most American first-year students prioritised developing meaningful life philosophies in the 1960s and were less interested in money, for example, more recently they cited becoming rich as a more important life goal. Santos feels such cultural values are problematic for our wellbeing. Economic disparities, racism and polarisation, she argues, aren’t only responsible for inequalities and persecution, they also fuel mental health problems and go against the happiness research, which suggests that connecting with other people – including those different from ourselves –and helping them is important.Santos remains cautiously hopeful. “There are lots of forces pushing us in the wrong direction,” she says. “There is something broken in our society and I think a lot of people are realising that.”Her next mission is to create a happiness course for high-school students (for which she recently got funding), with modules for parents, to curb child mental health problems and push more structural changes. “I think this might be another thing like climate change, young people fighting for change. Ultimately, it’s going to be their world down the line. If we can teach them the right way to do stuff, maybe they will make societies that are a little bit better.”In the meantime, Santos believes the pandemic can catalyse some of the inidual changes she’s proposing. “It’s an awful crisis and that’s not to belittle it,” she says. “But I think there are blessings in the middle of this.” She bolsters her conviction with research. For instance work by Professor Katherine Milkman of the University of Pennsylvania on how momentous times in our lives can create a fresh-start effect, motivating us to instil new habits, see time differently and take a broader view of our lives. Other research which should give us hope is on post-traumatic growth, the idea that crises can fuel transformations. Following them people often become more resilient, with deeper social connections, greater spirituality and clarity on how to live. In certain senses, they’re often glad for the experiences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0be7d18a3eb38b785616b19fc2d88c1e76ad3414/0_0_1555_2332/master/1555.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5afb40dc57970ccb8fcf95816e662ee2 880w","title":"picture a pandemic how guardian photographers adapted to lockdown life","story":"Our photojournalists explain how the pandemic has changed their practice – and why physical distancing is no barrier to producing intimate portraits by  Fiona Shields,  David Levene,  Sarah Lee,  Suki Dhanda and  Jonny WeeksThroughout the pandemic it has been important to show our readers and viewers what’s happening in the world outside, to make a historical document and to chart the progress of those on the frontline. During the first weeks, it was difficult to gain access to hospitals to see how they were coping – until photojournalist Jonny Weeks was invited on to the Covid-19 wards at University hospital in Coventry. We made a full risk assessment, considering his safety and the risk to those around him, and with the guidance of the staff there he produced a brilliant photo essay. He was one of the very first photojournalists to have this kind of access in the UK and it was a key story for the .Photographing people through windows, in outside\u0026nbspspaces or from the end of their front path has become an accepted feature of this time, like physically distanced queuing\u0026nbspat the supermarket.\u0026nbspIt’s remarkable how inappropriate photo-stories made before the pandemic\u0026nbspnow feel. Seeing people in crowded places such as music festivals, or people going to work – a time before face masks – has quickly become dated.\u0026nbspLike our vocabulary, our visual language and practice has changed, for now.\u0026nbspWe’d all seen images of lockdowns in Italy and Spain and so had a good sense of what was to come. It was clear that the streets of London would fall empty and silent that first morning of lockdown on 24 March. In normal times I would have tried to find high positions to shoot down from but I knew that would be impossible. So I bought a giant monopod online, which thankfully arrived on the 23rd. The thing goes as high as a house with the camera popped on top, which I control using a smartphone down below. So I spent the first few days of lockdown wandering around with it flung over my shoulder, able to shoot desolate London scenes from above within moments from any position. The light was incredible during those first days and weeks, which only increased the sense of urgency to be out there shooting as much as possible. It felt like we were witnessing something unique in our history, which demanded thorough documentation. The days were long and I found it impossible to relax. Even when I got home I felt like I should be back out there photographing. I’d watch the skies from my garden and felt pangs of regret if I saw dramatic clouds developing, sure in the knowledge that I was missing some momentous, empty London streetscape.I went into an early lockdown because my partner is shielding. But you can’t “work from home” as a photographer, so I started taking long walks around my home district, Camden. I’ve lived in this part of London for over 15 years, but having all this sudden time to walk and think and really look in a way I’ve never done before gave me a new perspective. I noticed light, details, and stark beauty in places I’d never seen carefully before. It was strange to do this work and to feel people were only distant, fleeting presences on the periphery of my attention. But that’s how the early weeks of lockdown felt.I’ve worked for the  and Observer for 20 years now, but I also do commercial work – one of my last big jobs before locking down was a Transport for London campaign that is currently decorating a transport network I can’t use – and personal work. I’m the sort of photographer who always carried my Leica with me and usually I don’t see the distinction between paid commissions and my own work. Photography feels like a vocation as well as a career.Fears about the virus meant that for those first two months I didn’t take my camera with me when I went on my rather limited walks. It felt like a possible mode of infection an object I constantly touch and then bring to my face. It’s the longest I’ve gone in my adult life without my camera and without photography. It’s been very painful and difficult.Also I desperately missed, and continue to miss, the human side of my job. I enjoy the huge privilege of meeting so many disparate people and having the unique, brief insights into their worlds that being a photographer usually brings on a daily basis. I realise now more than I ever have before how these daily encounters give meaning to my life and also provide all the sparks that fire both my creative energy and my personal energy. Without that, life is flatter.I did quite quickly realise that I had to continue taking photographs even if I wasn’t working and wasn’t able to use my “proper” camera. I did a series taken on my long walks round Camden.As the rules have loosened a little and I’ve grown braver on my bike, I’ve visited friends outside their homes or in their gardens, and for the past few weeks I’ve returned to my proper Leica. My work is always about intimacy and connection, and as I’ve gradually started to take photos with people in them again, I’m glad to see that side of my creative personality coming back.Going forward, though, I am extremely apprehensive. Photography is a competitive, anxious profession to be in at the best of times. But at the moment I feel I’m trapped inside an airless glass box, where on the outside there are signs of the world coming back to life tentatively and old connections being renewed. I worry I’ll have my nose pressed to the glass till we are safe with a vaccine.My biggest challenge, apart from keeping my four-year-old entertained, was getting my parents repatriated from India, which we eventually managed to do. Both are thankfully safe and well.After a couple of weeks of lockdown work was very quiet, I was getting itchy feet and was desperate to take pictures. We were encouraged to think of stories to photograph safely that we could contribute to the paper. I decided to go to Slough, where I grew up, and photograph the local Asian volunteers who were helping the wider community. I would follow the volunteers in my own car and take pictures of the vulnerable people receiving the donations – all photographed at a safe distance. The volunteers felt very valued when they appeared in the national newspaper and even more so online, viewed by an international audience.Before the lockdown I would mostly shoot in studios with lights and a crew of assistants – makeup artists, PRs and so on. Since lockdown, I have been working solo and most of the portraits have been shot outside. I have sometimes set up a mini-studio with a background in people’s gardens: luckily we had pretty good weather. I must say I have actually enjoyed working this way, keeping things as simple as possible, just me and the subject.In the early days of lockdown, I was frustrated by the lack of coverage from within UK hospitals. Compared with what we were seeing and reading from Italy and the US, we knew very little of our own NHS. For me at least, this meant I had very little concept of the everyday acts of heroism being performed by NHS staff and I really didn’t have much of a clue what I was clapping for during “clap for carers” on Thursday evenings. I felt detached. I approached University hospital in Coventry, where I was born, and was lucky to be granted exclusive access to cover every\u0026nbspaspect of their amazing work.In doing so I was able to document many members of staff and their personal contributions – nurses and doctors in ITU, cleaners and charity workers on the wards. It was a huge undertaking and, given the number\u0026nbspof deaths and the lack of access for family members, a story that had to be handled very sensitively. It was also a challenging assignment because I felt a weight of responsibility to my subjects and I was shooting in conditions that were frankly alien to me (trying to take documentary photographs while wearing PPE is not easy). Fortunately, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive: people valued the unique insight the story provided, they were comforted by the many positive stories that emerged from the tragedy of the pandemic, and they recognised that we had fulfilled our duty to our readers as a newspaper. It showed me that honest, respectful journalism can be immensely powerful. And I was quite chuffed at getting five pages of my work in the paper, too!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6efbc6f6805bc0a3e8edb24e36c6073565952e8f/0_90_2780_1668/master/2780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2d7f63df0ef3e91db3926eaec990fa1","title":"kurt cobain mtv unplugged in new york guitar sells for 6m","story":"Nirvana frontman’s 1959 Martin D-18E sold to Australian who will put it on tour, with proceeds going to help struggling artists The guitar used by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain during the band’s famous MTV Unplugged in New York concert has sold for more than $6m (£4.8m) at auction.The 1959 Martin D-18E featured in the grunge group’s performance in November 1993, five months before Cobain’s death aged 27.There had been fevered interest in the guitar in the weeks leading up to the sale and organiser Julien’s Auctions opened the bidding at a million dollars, but that was quickly shattered.The winning bid of $6,010,000 came from Australian businessman Peter Freedman, owner of Rode Microphones, who bid in person in Beverly Hills, seeing off competition from around the world.Julien’s Auctions said the sale set five world records, including most expensive guitar and most expensive piece of memorabilia.Freedman plans to display the guitar in a worldwide exhibition tour, taking the instrument to galleries and art spaces with all proceeds going to the performing arts.He told the PA news agency he was “scared shitless and shaking” when the auctioneer’s gavel dropped, but he is proud to be able to use the guitar to support artists and is already thinking of what to do with it next.He said: “It’s a big deal. I didn’t even buy it for me. I paid for it but I’m going to use it to highlight the plight of artists worldwide by touring it around and then I’m going to sell it and use the dough for that as well, later.”Freedman, whose family first opened an electronics shop in Sydney in 1967, added: “The musicians and artists have supported my family since the 60s. We’ve been in that game forever so I’ve been very lucky with Rode and I’ve been able to give away lots of money, quite a few mill.”He said he had no limit on what he would have paid.Freedman said: “There were some seriously rich people here and I suppose I could have been completely scared shitless and somebody who has got billions and billions just pays, what, 20, 30 million? But I would have kept going.”The guitar was the seventh of only 302 D-18Es built by Martin and was customised by Cobain, who added a Bartolini pickup to the soundhole.It came with the original hard-shell case decorated by the singer-songwriter with a flyer from the punk rock band Poison Idea’s 1990 album Feel The Darkness.Three baggage claim ticket stubs are attached to the handle, along with an Alaska Airlines sticker affixed to the case and the storage compartment contains Cobain’s half-used pack of guitar strings, picks and a suede “stash bag”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb57365c764b74e623442808ac190d6502c1851/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfe0735f5aece7b1d77d231b5e77b401","title":"nadine shah im sick of celebrities in their huge gardens telling us to breathe","story":"The musician talks about missing Glastonbury, being inspired by Abigail’s Party and turning the tables on music criticsKitchen Sink’s cover art is of 70s party food, shot in Technicolor.

Women still feel those feelings. There’s this idea that the sexual revolution and 70s feminism changed everything for women, but it didn’t, especially in places outside trendy London. Oh, I must mention the 70s dinner party Twitter feed that influenced me too. It’s full of food in the shape of other food. Look! A salmon quiche in the shape of a pineapple!The new album has lots of lyrics about being a woman, and getting older. Why make a pop album about that?Because it’s something women have to think about all the time, but you never hear songs about it. You say your age to some people, and they’re already raising their eyebrows, going “tick-tock”. Don’t you think that’s already on my mind? Don’t you realise some people might not want kids? Or can’t? Or might have tried? Or might have lost babies already? I did a lot of research for this album last year, which was basically talking to female friends in pubs. It’s amazing how much shit we all put up with.There are also songs about gaslighting, catcalling, and women being infantilised by men. The female protagonists often take back power. Was that important to you?Yes. I really wanted to take back power in a celebratory way, and I wanted its sound to be joyous too, not dour or mournful, and good to dance to. I worried early on about alienating men with some of the songs, to be honest, then I realised all the men I knew were brilliant, and never would. If anyone takes offence to anything on Kitchen Sink, they’re the one with the problem, not me.You presented the Q awards in 2019 to much fanfare, and you’ve also been doing a series of Instagram live interviews, Payback, in which you interview music critics. Was this purely out of devilment?Yes! Not really. I’ve just always found it weird to be asked a lot of questions in an interview, and not be expected to ask any back. Quite often, I’ve had a drink with a journalist afterwards, and I’ve been so nosy: “Ooh, who’s the worst person you’ve interviewed, then?” That’s always great to hear. This isn’t going to be a new direction for me, though, unless something happens organically, or I get really skint.

But what now for the future of No 10?After another terrible week for the government that saw two more screeching U-turns and warnings from Tory backbenchers of mounting discontent in the ranks, a former cabinet minister from Theresa May’s time as prime minister had this to say. “If we were in normal times you would be hearing talk by now about removing the prime minister. It is that bad. But you don’t get rid of leaders in a crisis like this.”The same Tory MP said that a batch of cabinet ministers including education secretary Gavin Williamson also deserved to be sacked and that the No 10 operation was “totally dysfunctional”. There were so many decisions of crucial importance in the fight against Covid-19 that had to be referred up the chain of command to Downing Street that its hugely inexperienced staff – many of whom were more used to running campaigns than the country - were simply unable to cope.Three months into the lockdown such views are now widely shared on the Conservative benches as the list of U-turns and broken promises over Covid-19 grows. The latest – a decision by health secretary Matt Hancock to ditch the tracing app hailed by Boris Johnson only weeks ago as “world beating” – prompted the Daily Mail to splash a despairing headline across its front page on Friday asking: “How many more Corona fiascos?”Only two days earlier Marcus Rashford, the Manchester United and England striker, had forced Johnson to do an about turn over free schools meals for the poorest pupils in the latest humiliation for the prime minister. Tory anger, already raised to dangerous levels by the recent scrapping of plans to re-open all primary schools before the summer holidays, was heightened still further by endless taunts about Rashford hitting the target, while Johnson and his Tory government had missed it yet again.And all this as the UK’s death toll from Covid-19 climbed towards 50,000, the worst performance of any European country, and as it heads into an economic downturn, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects to be more serious than those heading the way of any of our neighbour nations.The last three months have not only transformed profoundly the daily lives of every UK citizen but have also changed utterly the political mood in Westminster and the country. When Johnson announced the lockdown on 23 March, Jeremy Corbyn was still the Labour party’s leader, limping towards the end his tenure, while Johnson soared in the polls.Johnson even enjoyed a post-lockdown surge in ratings as his honeymoon with the electorate survived the closure of pubs, restaurants and shops. There was a rallying round the flag that seemed to play perfectly, for a time at least, for the Tory leader who modelled himself on Winston Churchill.Immediately after Starmer won Labour’s leadership contest on 4 April, many at Westminster thought he might struggle to make his mark with the pandemic raging. The seriousness of the nation’s plight meant he had little option but to offer to abandon normal political hostilities and pledge instead to work together in the national interest where possible with Johnson’s government.But soon it became apparent that Johnson and his administration, together with the Whitehall machine, had not planned adequately for the pandemic. Evidence came to light showing that the prime minister, while revelling in having delivered Brexit, had been asleep at the wheel in early to mid March as the virus spread to the West. It became clear that crucial days and weeks in which hard decisions should have been taken had been missed and that the lockdown had been ordered too late.Chaos ensued as NHS and care staff complained of a lack of personal protective equipment and the contact tracing system which had controlled the spread of the virus in countries like South Korea, was suddenly and mysteriously abandoned here. Subsequently ministers and health experts would admit that there simply had not been the capacity to carry out enough tests precisely when they were needed.As the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths soared and hospitals emptied their oldest patients who carried the virus into care homes, worsening the spread, trust in Johnson’s government began to drain away. Starmer, not wanting to be associated with the increasingly obvious failings gradually turned up the criticism and picked holes in Johnson’s defences at successive prime minister’s questions. Then last month the  and Daily Mirror broke the story of how Johnson’s closest adviser Dominic Cummings had appeared to breach rules by driving with his wife and child to Durham – something for which he refused to resign or apologise – and trust in Johnson’s regime hit the floor.On Monday evening, Tory concerns at the way the government was handling the crisis were aired at a meeting of the executive of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers. Senior MPs were furious that No 10 was blundering on while refusing to listen to advice offered by them on how to avoid more disasters.Since then concerns have been expressed privately by many of the new Tory MPs from seats in the north of England who went on local radio and television stations to speak out against free school meals only to see the government pull the rug from under them and do its U-turn days later. Another former cabinet minister said: “They feel very bruised. They went out in public to take the government line, when the more cynical of us could see a U-turn coming and made ourselves unavailable to the media for a couple of days.”There is still more than four years for Johnson and his government to recover its poise and sense of direction, and for the memories of Covid-19 crisis to fade. It is true also that Starmer, while having proved effective in criticising the Tories for their failings so far, has yet to offer much of his own agenda for the future.But the transformed mood among the new generation of Tory MPs who came to Westminster expecting so much in December is telling. They arrived so optimistic about Johnson’s government and their party, only to see it flounder. An ex-minister added: “A lot of them were elected unexpectedly and so from December 12 to the end of January they were having the world’s most-extended Christmas because everything they had ever dreamed of had landed in their laps.“Since then, though, the plague has arrived and their entire life has been turned upside down and they don’t know what has hit them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a3fc8fda4cfbdc16413a83375d8d6765f8dab99/0_132_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d7175b0e789d46154f7833c2fc77907","title":"dfid staff devastated and demoralised by foreign office merger","story":"No 10 accused of exploiting Covid-19 pandemic to rush through Whitehall shake-upDowning Street is facing growing anger from staff at the Department for International Development (DfID), some of whom accuse it of exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic by pushing through a merger with the Foreign Office (FCO).Plans had long been mooted to combine the two Whitehall departments but insiders were shocked by the timing and manner of the announcement – which came without union consultation, with many staff finding out via an apparent leak to the media.DfID employees criticised the merger, with one saying staff were “devastated, demoralised, angry, anxious” and claiming Boris Johnson had seized on the pandemic to “achieve a long-term goal” in axing the department as a standalone entity.Another said it was a politicised, opportunistic move that had “pulled the rug away” from under staffers’ feet, with many worried about job security.Unions representing DfID civil servants, who have written to the FCO demanding formal consultation over the plans, said their members were “shocked and angered” and that the staff testimony obtained by the  was a “damning indictment”.Sarah Champion, the chair of the Commons’ international development select committee – which released an interim report earlier this month arguing for the retention of DfID as a standalone government department – said the timing and way in which the merger was announced was “callous”. She added that the government’s treatment of staff was “outrageous”.DfID, formed in 1997 – although incarnations have existed under previous governments – employs about 3,600 staff working in offices in London and East Kilbride, as well as around the world. Plans for the new department, to be called the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and due to be set up by September, have been criticised by three former prime ministers.One DfID employee, whose identity the  is protecting, said: “I feel like the majority of staff have a mix of emotions on the merger – devastated, demoralised, angry, anxious. You could just pick a negative emotion and I’ve felt it at some point since we heard the news.“It’s been a long-held goal for the Conservative party, and Boris Johnson in particular, to merge the departments, so it wasn’t a complete bolt from the blue. But nobody expected it would come so quickly. As civil servants, we felt we should have been told first, but we found out through leaks to the media before the prime minister’s statement to the House of Commons. It just shows the contempt they have for DfID.“This is about the prime minister using the pandemic to achieve a long-term goal and making a snap announcement about it and not even giving staff the opportunity to react.”Another DfID employee said: “Like most people at DfID, I’m really passionate about my job and I’m still reeling at the news of the merger. There’s been murmurings about it, the signs were there, but no one thought it would happen now as we’re in the midst of the pandemic. We’re all sitting at home struggling with dealing with the ramifications of this. It’s pulled the rug away from everyone’s feet.“There’s a tide of confusion, disbelief and uncertainty among staff. Are their jobs safe? How is this going to work? How long is it going to take? They’re saying it’ll be done by September but that’s 11 weeks away, and the government doesn’t move quick. Then there’s the question of whether this is a merger or a Foreign Office takeover. Are we being subsumed? We’re angry and upset. There have been a lot of tears.“I think the government has been opportunistic with its timing on the merger announcement. They seem to be using the crisis so that this goes under the radar. It’s a politicised move, and about cuts as well.”Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), said: “The testimony people in DfID have given is a damning indictment of the decision to merge the department with FCO … Boris Johnson’s slash-and-burn approach to international aid not only threatens the livelihoods of our members in DfID and FCO but will significantly damage our relations with other countries at a time when we need all the friends we can muster.”Allan Sampson, the national officer at FDA – which represents senior civil servants – said: “Members in DfID were shocked and angered by the announcement, made worse by the fact they initially found out about it through the media. Their immediate fear is for the number of jobs available within the new department, but concern also exists regarding the nature of the new work.”Champion said: “DfID staff do the job because they believe in the work, it’s more than a job for them – it’s a moral drive to try and alleviate poverty. To have the government use the department as a pawn in this way and staff treated with so little respect or compassion, is outrageous. It shows a level of a callousness that I would never expect of a UK government. I’m not fundamentally against a merger, I just haven’t seen any evidence that shows it’s the right way forward.”A government spokesman said DfID staff “can take pride” in their work, saying their “ambition, vision and expertise will be at the heart of the new department”, which will “bring together our international effort and maximise the influence and impact of our world-leading development and foreign policy experts”.They added: “The merger will mean adjustments in how teams are structured in the new department, and some roles and responsibilities across both DfID and FCO will change. But there will be no compulsory redundancies, and we will work closely with staff throughout the process of implementing the merger – including through the unions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e28dcc1bcef1cc17e171ed4c665acfdb28ce3c6/0_138_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19053a46e4dc5b94dff2047748892cc6","title":"september reshuffle expected in effort to stem faltering tory poll ratings","story":"Backbenchers and party activists are unimpressed by U-turns and dithering as public support continues to fallMinisters are expecting a wide-ranging government reshuffle in September in which Boris Johnson will sack key figures who are judged to have underperformed in the Covid-19 crisis.Cabinet sources said the move was now seen as inevitable. They believe sweeping changes will be made in an attempt to defuse mounting discontent on the Tory backbenches following a stream of U-turns and a fall in the party’s poll ratings.Among those seen as vulnerable are education secretary Gavin Williamson, communities secretary Robert Jenrick and work and pensions secretary Thérèse Coffey.Senior backbenchers and former ministers have become increasingly frustrated after a week in which Johnson’s government performed two further U-turns over free school meals for children from poorer families, and the much vaunted Covid-19 tracing app.There is also growing anger among Tory MPs at the way Downing Street is centralising control and refusing to listen to ministers or backbenchers.On Saturday night, Whitehall sources said government was ready to perform yet another U-turn by shelving much-trailed plans to extend Sunday trading hours. Instead ministers want to prioritise legislation necessary to loosen the lockdown by allowing more “al fresco” dining and drinking, which will be unveiled in the Commons this week.Writing on the Observer’s website, Sir Bernard Jenkin, chair of the House of Commons liaison committee, warns against centralisation by No 10. In what will be seen as criticism of the prime minister’s closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, Jenkin writes: “The government has looked on the defensive recently, mainly because of the nature of the crisis and what it inherited, but centralisation of power is not the answer. Great leaders listen and engage those around them, welcoming challenge. They treat all truths, however bad, as good news and as an opportunity to learn.”The mood is also increasingly rancorous among activists who are alarmed at the party’s slide in the polls.The former MP Paul Goodman, who now edits grassroots Tory website ConservativeHome, suggested a change of personnel at the top would help. “The government has the same operational problem as Theresa May did before the 2017 election – namely, a decision-making bottleneck.“It isn’t terminal, but it’s problematic. What would help would be bigger, braver cabinet ministers and a more relaxed, collegiate central operation. No one seriously thinks that this cabinet is the Conservative first 11.”Johnson is coming under pressure from some MPs to beef up his Cabinet team with more experience. Names being tipped for returns to the top table include Jeremy Hunt and Liam Fox. Downing Street sources said there were “no imminent plans” for a cabinet reshuffle.Johnson is expected on Tuesday to announce plans to relax the two-metre social distancing rule when the Covid-19 infection rate has fallen further. Legislation will also be introduced to allow pubs and restaurants more latitude to serve drinks and food outside.Ministers are also hoping to bring forward plans for travel corridors to be set up between the UK and up to eight other countries to allow more holidays.The arts sector is confident that ministers will soon bring forward plans to prevent the collapse of the West End and major entertainment venues. This follows interventions from West End producer Cameron Mackintosh, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and the director Sam Mendes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/188cd9b5a7066acc76e5c21d8f9cc687b2ce1881/0_498_4827_2896/master/4827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=524489d9ac84c0f4ecc8d9fb31a0d851","title":"human genome project unlocking dna covid 19 cystic fibrosis molecular scientists","story":"Thanks to the success of the Human Genome Project, 20 years ago this week, scientists can track biology and disease at a molecular level Twenty years ago this week, an international group of scientists announced it had put together the first genetic blueprint of a human being. After 10 years of effort, the team – made up of thousands of scientists working on both sides of the Atlantic – revealed it had pinpointed all 3bn units of DNA that make up the human genome.The result was “the most wondrous map ever created by humankind”, US President Bill Clinton told a special White House ceremony to mark the event. A parallel event, hosted by Tony Blair in Downing Street, also featured glittering praise for the effort.The $2.7bn (£2.2bn) Human Genome Project remains one of science’s greatest feats of investigation. It was described, at the time, as biology’s answer to the Apollo space programme. It took researchers on a very different journey – not of outward exploration, but an inward voyage: a mission to unravel the molecular essence of humanity.Armed with the resulting “wondrous map”, scientists would soon, it was assumed, isolate the genes for height, eye colour, intelligence and myriad other human attributes. However, this simple goal has been confounded by the fact that a great many inidual human attributes are determined by dozens, if not hundreds of genes. We are too complex for reductionism.Nevertheless, the biological revolution let loose on 25 June 2000 has had remarkable results. The draft genome published that day was later followed up with more and more accurate “maps” of our DNA until the project was officially closed in 2003 with publication of a final, full human genome. Ever since, gene sequence studies set up in the project’s wake have been involved in growing numbers of remarkable discoveries.For example, DNA studies have shown our species once mated with Neanderthals while other projects have pinpointed mutated genes that cause cancers and melanomas. Others have helped to develop new drugs for conditions ranging from cystic fibrosis to asthma.These successes have been achieved because gene sequencing, over the decades, has become a highly automated and incredibly cheap process. “It took a decade of intense effort to create that first rough draft of a human genome,” said Cordelia Langford, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, near Cambridge, where UK scientists played a prime role in Britain’s involvement in the Human Genome Project. “Today, we sequence around 3,000 full genomes a week. It has become a simple, straightforward process.”Not all these genomes belong to humans. Some belong to other animals and others to our mortal enemies – such as the organisms responsible for malaria and cholera, a list of foes that has now been expanded to include Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Sequencing its tiny genome is now providing doctors and public authorities with critically important information about the disease.“We are sequencing samples of Sars-Cov-2 from different sources to see if the virus is mutating significantly,” said Dominic Kwiatkowski, director of the Centre for Genomics and Global Health at Oxford university. “The jury is still out on that. However, we are also using sequencing technology to highlight tiny variations in samples from different places, and that should help us pinpoint the locations of new outbreaks.”A very different use of sequencing technology is being pursued by Sarah Teichmann, leader of the Human Cell Atlas project. “Devices are now so sensitive that we can analyse DNA from a single cell and at the same time compare our findings with DNA from millions of other comparable cells,” she said.That data tells researchers what the cells in our bodies are doing at a very high resolution and at a specific time, information that has led to the discovery of many new types of cells, many in the immune system and others in the body’s various tissues.“This work has triggered a major revolution in understanding our bodies’ cells and their organisation in tissue and organs,” said Teichmann, who is also based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. “By comparing healthy tissue with diseased tissue in this way, we are getting incredible new insights into the mechanisms of those diseases. This is a very powerful technique.”Such insights have included pinpointing cells involved in the development of cystic fibrosis, asthma and certain human tumours. The discoveries have opened up the prospect of developing therapies for these conditions.The Human Genome Project is clearly having a big impact on medicine and research, but its progress was not without controversy during the course of its work, which began in 1990. “We were in a race. It was as simple as that,” said Langford, who is now the Sanger’s director of science operation but who worked as a research assistant during the project’s early days. “We were out to stop people from putting patents on human DNA that was being sequenced elsewhere.”At the time, a rival outfit to the Human Genome Project – known as Celera – had been set up with the maverick researcher Craig Venter as its head. “They wanted to put patents on the DNA they were uncovering. We wanted to make sure everyone could use the data and were putting every sequence we found into the public domain to block any attempt to privatise the genome. And in the end we succeeded.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69184b5dbaa7ba350a2abb2fe578f72112ae5e5/0_351_5299_3180/master/5299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd4b311826a2400a1437beeb96974321","title":"build 100000 homes for covid 19 heroes say uk council leaders","story":"An investment in social housing will create thousands of jobs and generate £320bn over 50 years, LGA claims At least 100,000 homes should be built every year to rent to key workers who have helped fight coronavirus and to the families of those who have lost loved ones in the pandemic, according to a report by the Local Government Association.The cross-party LGA says the modern day “homes for heroes” plan would also help regenerate the economy and create many thousands of jobs, while massively cutting the nation’s huge housing benefit bill.Its report, to be published this week, says the 100,000 target should become part of the government’s wider ambition for building 300,000 homes a year. The new social housing could also be used to accommodate the many thousands of rough sleepers who were placed in hotels and other temporary places during the pandemic.The LGA’s report, Building new social rent homes – an updated economic appraisal, is evidence of growing pressure on ministers to use house building as central part of economic regeneration measures, which the prime minister Boris Johnson has said will be announced by the chancellor Rishi Sunak within weeks.The LGA research found that investment in a generation of social housing would create £320bn for the country over 50 years through increased economic activity. It also found that every £1 invested in a new social home generates £2.84 in the wider economy with every new social home generating a saving of £780 a year in housing benefit.David Renard, LGA housing spokesman and Tory leader of Swindon borough council, said the scheme would be a modern day version of the “home for heroes” house building projects after the world wars. “As the nation comes through the biggest crisis we have faced since the second world war, we owe it to the health, care and other essential public service workers, who have risked their lives to keep the country running, to provide them with affordable, high-quality homes,” Renard said.“The government should let councils take charge of the housing recovery, by giving them the powers and tools to build more of the affordable homes the country desperately needs.”  Groups of housing associations, developers and architects have been pushing similar ideas as the effect of the pandemic on construction and the wider economy has become clear. The LGA wants ministers to expand council housing by bringing forward and increasing its £12bn extension to the Affordable Homes Programme, announced in the budget earlier this year, with an increased focus on homes for social rent. The vast majority of homes delivered under the scheme – which involves private and public- sector funding – are for ownership not rent.The council leaders also say the “right to buy” system should be reformed with councils able to retain 100 per cent of receipts from the sale of homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f1f46f8a829784d18aab26a92e0a361599f1500/0_243_4527_2716/master/4527.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b27000166176d1cb7f747e816525fc97","title":"the future of the arts online theatre is a skeleton of the thing itself","story":"With real life now the biggest show in town, our theatre critic reflects on the catastrophic effects of lockdown, and talks to industry insiders about navigating a way backNot ill, bereaved or penniless.\u0026nbspAlthough dependent for my living on the performing arts – a sector so savaged by lockdown that it is at risk of permanent mutilation – I have so far been fortunate.

They are everywhere – apart from on the stage.\u0026nbspTransmuted. The ingenuity of companies and iniduals has been astonishing. Podcasts from The Lockdown Plays of new work\u0026nbspby, among others, Caryl Churchill and Simon Stephens. The entire cycle of Shakespeare’s sonnets read, under the auspices of London’s Jermyn Street theatre,\u0026nbspby established actors – among them,\u0026nbspOlivia Colman and Penelope Wilton –\u0026nbspand final-year drama students. The Royal Court is challenging audiences to make their own videos based on single lines from plays performed at the theatre. At last, radio drama is getting a boost: not least through actor Bertie Carvel’s initiative in taking productions whose runs were cut short by Covid-19 to BBC Radio 3 and 4 with his Lockdown Theatre festival. Meanwhile, the National Theatre, which has streamed a terrific, varied menu, from One Man, Two Guvnors to Barber Shop Chronicles, has become truly nationwide, barriers of price and place dissolved. As has the National Theatre of Scotland. \u0026nbspStreaming and recording has been a gigantic ad for theatre writing, acting and directing. But it’s a skeleton of the thing itself.\u0026nbspWork on stage happens in the present, at a particular moment: it can’t, any more than life, be rewound or fast-forwarded.\u0026nbspThe director Richard Eyre, who in March had two shows running in the West End, puts it pungently: “Live theatre is at war with lockdown.”\u0026nbspNot least because an essential “chemical ingredient” for actors and audiences is physical closeness. The very element that defines it makes it hard to get going again.Theatre can help fund hospital beds: last year it brought in £133m in VAT in London alone.\u0026nbspLast week a letter to the Treasury from nearly 100 of this year’s Olivier and other award nominees – among them Sharon D Clarke, Andrew Scott and Tom Stoppard – called on the government urgently to consider the plans for support outlined by UK TheatreSociety of London Theatres, which included the proposal that the government become a “theatrical angel”, investing in shows and sharing in the profits. In the Financial Times, director Sam Mendes drew attention to another source of revenue. Streaming services such as Amazon Prime and Netflix have been made rich – richer – by drawing on acting, writing and directorial talent during the pandemic: they could now help sustain that money-starved talent.Paradoxically, the buttoned-up Brits are celebrated abroad for their dramatic gifts: the theatre brings us visitors. In its particular ability to take us into and lift us out of ourselves, it can also help us imagine a new future.\u0026nbspWhat will the post-pandemic theatre be like? It cannot be as white – on stage and backstage – as it has been allowed to be. This was changing slowly before the coronavirus, and change will surely – must – accelerate after the 2020 anti-racism protests. It may be, as Kathy Burke predicted last month on Radio 4’s Saturday Live, that there will be a resurgence of urgent fringe work. Richard Eyre agrees. “Those of us who remember the 70s remember that is exactly what happened. Theatres like the Oval House and Soho and Battersea Arts Centre were started by people who didn’t have subsidy and resources, but wanted to express themselves.”Meanwhile, an under-reported aspect of theatre continues. It’s exemplified by James Brining and Robert Hastie, artistic directors of Leeds Playhouse and\u0026nbspSheffield Theatres, who run stages that put on big, buoyant shows and which also have a clear civic function. Both, having successfully reduced their public subsidy, are now in dire straits: it costs tens of thousands of pounds a week to keep a theatre closed.\u0026nbspBoth men have plans for the summer, with Brining constructing links across the city with other arts organisations, including Opera North, and Hastie negotiating with Sheffield council to stage quick-moving (an hour-and-a-half straight through), open-air Shakespeare.Both are continuing online the work that, like most not-for-profit theatres, they do routinely: with groups of refugees, the elderly and schools. This might be seen as social work. But it’s a particular kind: concerned, as Brining puts it, with helping people “to see themselves – and to see themselves differently”. That is something theatre can do while being explosively entertaining: as one of Sheffield’s great successes, Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, has proved. It can also, as Eyre points out, offer something else crucially needed now.\u0026nbsp“You go in as iniduals and, if it works, at the end you become a group, a society.” Isolation unlocked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4163a9aecb8ad9d65dcc7227256dcdcc2e686e68/852_4110_5341_3203/master/5341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e489649e900f27904b0e67dfc4abd115","title":"the big picture voyage of discovery sydney 2018","story":"An Australian family takes to the sea in search of a modern idyll, in Alex Vaughan’s award-winning photoIn 2016, Steve and Beccie Soetekouw sold their farm on Tasmania, bought a 43ft yacht and, with no boating experience, set off to sail around the world with their 10 children. Photographer Alex Vaughan took this picture – a winner at this year’s OpenWalls Arles awards – off Chinamans Beach in Sydney in 2018, where the family’s boat was moored. The Soetekouws had by then been two years at sea and were celebrating the arrival of a baby girl, Squeak, who was three days old.Vaughan had heard about the family from a friend and rowed out to see them, ending up talking for a couple of hours to Beccie, “while all the kids patiently listened, chiming in occasionally with thoughtful comments and questions, the little ones climbing over the big ones. No devices, no distractions - I had never seen kids as calm and engaged for that period of time.” Vaughan ended up documenting their life on the water over 12 months.For Vaughan, the family came to represent the possibility of different ways of being in the world. The original motivation for the voyage was the familiar one – too much work, too little time together – taken to something of an extreme. The Soetekouws’ experience, Vaughan suggests, showed that “maybe the dream life of large mortgages and the continual and obsessive acquisition of things could be traded for a less traditional lifestyle that puts time with family and in nature at the forefront of existence”.Beccie has taken on most of the responsibility of home-schooling the children while at sea. A year after this picture was taken, tragedy struck the family when their three-year-old daughter, Zeinobiyah, fell from the boat and drowned while they were at anchor in the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney. Though heartbroken, the Soetekouws have not abandoned their nomadic life in February this year, on their Facebook page Our Round the World Adventure, Steve announced to their many followers the birth of a baby girl.

An enemy of Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner, Christie was summarily fired in what he called a political “hit job”.The ensuing chaos of the Trump transition has been widely chronicled, not least by the Moneyball author Michael Lewis in a bestselling book, The Fifth Risk.According to Lewis, Trump’s campaign chair, Steve Bannon, “was fucking nervous” about Trump’s handling of the transition.“I go, ‘Holy fuck, this guy doesn’t know anything. And he doesn’t give a shit.’”In a statement, Kaufman said the Biden team would “ensure continuity of government” in the event that their candidate must prepare to take over amid the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic crisis.“No one will have taken office facing such daunting obstacles since Franklin Delano Roosevelt,” said Kaufman, adding that Biden was ready to begin that work “the day he is sworn in as president”.Roosevelt took office in 1933, with the world in the grip of the Great Depression. He won four terms and died in 1945, shortly before victory was secured in the second world war.Kaufman, who filled the US Senate seat for Delaware when Biden became vice-president to Barack Obama in 2009, co-authored a 2015 law that requires initial transition work to begin six months before an election.Yohannes Abraham, who served in Barack Obama’s White House, will manage the day-to-day operation of the transition team, which will be independent of Biden’s presidential campaign.Recruits also include the former CIA deputy director Avril Haines, another Obama administration veteran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc0a8d0f781218afde2928e7ceb99d3586143e4/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d96f6d3ac486874298401b078daa3b2","title":"juneteenth celebrations in texas in pictures","story":"Texans turned out for a Juneteenth celebration in Galveston, where the event that inspired the holiday took place in 1865. by  Erum Salam, photographs by Doogie RouxA small but mighty crowd stood 6ft apart in the blistering Texas sun at 10am on the lawn of Galveston’s historic Ashton Villa.The Ashton Villa building once served as a residence of the Confederate army during the civil war.

She and her mother were waiting in the welfare office for food stamps when López overheard the case officer speaking down to her mother.Their lives before they got there hadn’t been easy. López and her mother moved from Puerto Rico when López was a baby, relocating to Williamsburg in New York. Back then, Williamsburg was the most densely populated city in the US: a by-word for poverty rather than trendy coffee shops and vintage boutiques as it is today. It was also host to a fierce sweatshop trade, and López’s family were privy to its harsh hours and low pay.So López did not like the assumption that her mother was poor because she had not worked hard enough. “I said, you can’t speak to her like that – she is hard-working, she paid into this system,” says Lopez. It was an early lesson to her, that services for poor people can humiliate, rather than help.There’s just one problem: she is running against nine other contenders, many of them former elected officials.Growing up in New York’s homeless shelter system, López learned a lot. She learned how to dodge the bullies after school, who would follow her back to the shelter she lived in and laugh at her. She learned how to sit quietly in the back of the sweatshop while she did her homework – and as a byproduct of that, that her mother could work incredibly hard and still not be paid enough to afford a babysitter. She learned not to go to the communal bathrooms in her shelter without shoes on – in case there was blood or broken glass on the floor. Ultimately, she was learning that people like her deserved better.After graduating from Columbia University, López worked for the current incumbent in the south Bronx, congressman José E Serrano. She worked largely on housing cases, but tinkering around the edges while people continuously came back with the same problems frustrated her. She wanted to get involved at an earlier stage – long before people needed bailing out from evictions or were placed in another unaffordable home.“I wanted to be part of the creative process of building affordable housing, learning about the development process, learning about housing finance. I wanted to be able to say: ‘OK, we need housing – now how do we build it?’” says López.So López studied for a masters in urban planning – a passion which is made clear when she talks about how buildings, parks or highways can oppress or influence people.López points to the history of the Bronx as an example of how planning decisions can affect a community forever. Robert Moses’ infamous Cross Bronx Expressway, for example, physically separated the south and the north Bronx, ripping up communities and homes in its path. It brought opportunity for some New Yorkers, but only at the expense of the working-class communities that it destroyed: low house prices as well as poorer life outcomes around that crossway have been blamed on its development.She talks about the red lines drawn around communities of color in New York, in a time when coveted areas were color coded and graded through a mapping system. The green areas were marked with an “A” if they were were devoid of “a single foreigner or Negro”. Almost all of the south Bronx was coded red. Eventually, federal government lost interest in those areas, and banks deemed them too risky to lend to. Unable to make them profitable again, Landlords disowned their properties in the Bronx. Some even burned down people’s homes for the insurance money.“The built environment influences your perception of the world and how you see yourself in it. When you see certain things around you, you internalize them – I did when I was growing up. You see cracked bottles and wonder: does this mean I’m not worth it? Am I not deserving of being in this world?” she says.So when López was in grad school, she and two colleagues – all women of color who loved cycling – created a program that would take kids from the Bronx on biking trips to educate them about their local surroundings.“In communities of color that are underserved, we needed to create an avenue for those voices in the community, especially for young people,” says López about the project. They would cycle over to an affordable housing development, to learn about the housing development process, or to a community garden to learn how many local treasures existed there, waiting to be found.To López’s mind, this was an exercise in redistribution. Planning, architecture, real estate – all are pivotal in deciding what a local area looks like, but they are dominated by white men. Changing the makeup of those professions could play a pivotal role in transforming a community.López is unafraid of her contenders, regardless of their money and clout. Her contenders – who, among others, include Michael Blake, vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, and New York state senator Rubén Díaz Sr – may have already established themselves politically. But according to López, that’s all the more reason for her to win.“There are a lot of formerly elected officials running in this race that have taken positions for things like rezoning, that have pushed jail-building, that have a habit of taking lobbyist money and real estate developer money and a history of putting those interests first, before the people,” she tells me.López has pledged not to take any corporate Pac money during her race, and hopes her platform, which includes fighting for housing as a human right, universal healthcare for all and backing a Green New Deal, will be enough to win over the people of the South Bronx.If that sounds like a familiar platform it is because it is. López is backed by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as having the official backing of Democratic Socialists of America, the group responsible for propelling firebrands such as Rashida Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez into power. Lopez’s endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez is no small feat: her endorsement was much coveted for the Democratic presidential candidates this year.Meanwhile, one candidate in the race, Díaz, has branded himself as the “opposite of AOC” – a shot at appealing to voters he believes are tired of increasingly liberal policies in New York. Díaz has name recognition. With a political career in the Bronx stretching back decades, he even has buildings named after him in the area. His homophobia runs back to the 90s, too – as do his extreme stances on abortion. In 2012, in a 1,000-word document he stated: “Hitler was pro-choice. He chose to send the Jews to Auschwitz. That was not their choice that was Hitler’s choice.”López’s campaign claims the poll was conducted by a Torres ally. Sean McElwee, the head of the company that conducted it, claimed the results meant progressives should back Ritchie Torres, which the poll suggested had the best chance of stopping Diaz Sr. “We must remember that three weeks out from AOC’s 2018 election, Joe Crowley’s polling had him leading by 36 percentage points,” López’s team said.Galvanizing Bronx voters under the current circumstances could prove tricky. The Bronx has been hit hard by the coronavirus. It leads New York City in terms of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Locally, it has been referred to as the “death towers”.New York’s shutdown, which remains firmly in place as select industries reopened, stripped door-knocking, leafletting and local events from López’s campaigning arsenal. That’s a tough sell when you’re trying to build a grassroots movement from the ground up.But López’s team are quietly assured. She says door-knocking efforts before the pandemic gave her tens of thousands of resident’s details. López has used them to help establish a mutual aid network, checking in on residents, running errands for them and delivering hot meals and groceries.She also has hundreds of volunteers at her disposal, phone-banking every week, in shifts of 60-70 volunteers at a time. They claim to be reaching tens of thousands of voters each week, over half of whom are supportive López’s campaign.So what will she do if she wins it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b6d3168c161f528b34b3c6a92be6331bfb47b8a/0_241_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c47fece61d2c7889b18621c5ecbbc40e","title":"us presidential election mail in ballots doubt","story":"Twenty years after the disputed election, cyberhacking, disinformation and coronavirus are new threats – and some experts fear the president will sow doubtRon Klein survived the trench warfare of one disputed presidential election. As co-chair of the Al Gore campaign in Florida two decades ago, he watched lawyers brutally slug it out for weeks over vote recounts. “Republicans were very aggressive,” he recalls, “and they beat the Democrats in court.”Twenty years later, America is now staring down the barrel of an election that could make the shenanigans of Bush v Gore in 2000 look like child’s play.Many voting systems across the US are still rickety and unprepared for a massive surge of mail-in ballots. Cyberhacking, disinformation and the coronavirus are new threats. Most ominously, this time there is an incumbent in the White House many fear will sow doubt, thrive on chaos and simply refuse to accept defeat.“The business community is really getting concerned about the integrity of this election,” Klein added. “They’re concerned that it is being set up in a way that if it doesn’t go a certain person’s way, that person may claim that he still has the office and won’t leave. They just feel in terms of the stability of the United States and likelihood of disruption, it’s very, very dangerous.”The race to succeed Bill Clinton in 2000 came to hinge on swing state Florida. Katherine Harris, the Florida secretary of state and co-chair of George W Bush’s statewide campaign, announced that Bush had won the state. Gore called his opponent to concede but, as the margin narrowed, phoned back to withdraw his concession.Democrats demanded a recount in Florida but Republicans said no. Lawyers joined the battle on both sides, wrangling for five weeks over what voters had intended with poorly designed punch-card ballots (“hanging chads” and “dimpled chads”) and why likely Democrats appeared to have voted for Pat Buchanan, a conservative Christian running as a third-party candidate.Republicans, future Donald Trump ally Roger Stone among them, seized the narrative with hardball tactics that included rowdy protests outside meetings of election officials. The battle went all the way to the supreme court which, in a 5-4 vote, ruled that no alternative method of recount could be established in a timely manner. Bush would be the 43rd president Gore said he disagreed with the verdict but accepted it.Two decades on, both sides are already hiring lawyers for a bitter struggle that might go way beyond a handful of counties in a single state. A preview was offered by a recent primary election in Georgia, where voters waited up to five hours to cast ballots at some polling places due to equipment problems, workers being unfamiliar with a new voting system and pandemic-related physical distancing measures.Many voters showed up to vote in person because absentee ballots they requested never arrived by mail. Officials said thousands of mailed-in ballots may not have been counted because of faulty software or badly calibrated vote-tabulation scanners. To avoid similar setbacks in November, Democrats and voting rights activists are pushing for a massive expansion of mail-in voting.Ron Wyden, Democratic senator for Oregon, which already votes by mail, warned in a Medium post this week: “If Congress and states don’t act immediately, our country could face an electoral Chernobyl this fall.”In a phone interview, Wyden added: “We already know that Donald Trump is going to say the election has been stolen from him, no matter what, so we’re trying all the things to take away those kinds of arguments from him. For example, our focus on having the state and federal governments do everything to prepare for expanded voting right now is absolutely key to minimizing the questions.”But Trump has threatened to pull funding from states that have tried to get absentee ballots to all voters. The president has frequently asserted, without evidence, that mail-in voting leads to “total election fraud” and his Republican allies in Congress have repeatedly opposed funding to expand it.It is a claim Trump is likely to make loudly if he is polling badly in November. There are also concerns that he may seek to exploit any hiccups or irregularities Florida, for instance, is a crucial swing state with a long history of glitches. Election experts have warned that results could be delayed in many places, maybe by days, so that the winner is not known on election night – might Trump use that time to spread conspiracy theories and declare victory? Amplified by conservative media, he could establish a momentum that would be hard to stop, reminiscent of Bush in 2000.Klein, who went on to serve in Congress and is now a lawyer based in Fort Lauderdale, said: “President Trump is splashing water on this notion that we’re not gonna have a fair election because there’s fraud, unproven, like he did last time. It’s very troubling to have the person who has the biggest microphone put out those kinds of thoughts and intimidate and scare people into thinking that no matter what the outcome, they’re not going to believe it’s fair. That’s a threat to democracy itself.”Trump’s challenger, Democrat Joe Biden, told Comedy Central’s Daily Show recently: “This president is going to try to steal this election. This is a guy who said that all mail-in ballots are fraudulent, voting by mail, while he sits behind the desk in the Oval Office and writes his mail-in ballot to vote in a primary” – referring to Trump himself voting by mail in Florida.But noting that military leaders have recently been willing to speak out against the president, Biden added: “You have so many rank-and-file military personnel saying, ‘Well, we’re not a military state, this is not who we are.’ I promise you, I’m absolutely convinced, they will escort him from the White House in a dispatch.”There has never been such a scenario in a country that prides itself on the peaceful transfer of power at each inauguration.Klein remarked: “It’s pretty amazing to think that we’re even having this conversation: that a president wouldn’t leave if he or she was not successful and Biden’s comments that the military will have to intervene and take him out of the White House. That is just like Venezuela it doesn’t sound like the United States. But I think at this stage, people have come to expect Donald Trump is capable of doing anything, so who knows?”Grassroots activists are mobilizing to prevent such a constitutional crisis.Last week the groups Inisible and Stand Up America launched Protect the Results, a joint effort to mobilize millions of Americans should Trump seek to undermine the outcome of the election. The plans include protests and potential work strikes, calls to state and local election officials to ensure that every vote is counted accurately, and applying pressure on officials to defend democracy.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Inisible, said: “You’d have to be living under a rock for the last three and a half years to think that Donald Trump is going to go willingly.The Trump campaign gives short shrift to the concerns. Courtney Parella, deputy press secretary, said: “The Democrats are the only ones trying to create chaos in our election system by pressuring states to switch to universal vote-by-mail, something election experts have already warned that states cannot and should not attempt to do by November.“The media and Democrats, like Senator Wyden, continue to spread fear to keep voters away from the polls while enthusiasm for the president is at a record high. Preventing Americans from voting in-person is voter suppression and pretending that fraud doesn’t exist in mail voting is both dangerous and irresponsible. Make no mistake, if Democrats in Washington take control of elections, we will never see another free and fair election.”But just as in 2000, there appears to be one guaranteed winner of the 2020 election: the legal profession.The looming dispute offers rich pickings. Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University, observed: “Both sides are lawyering up to the eyebrows. There are lawyers in every state, both for the Democrats and for the Republicans, trying, depending on how you view it, either to protect the integrity of the vote or to subvert it.“The worst part of that is people are essentially primed not to trust the process. They know it’s easily manipulated and that makes people more prone to listen to Trump and his minions when they say that the vote was stolen from them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adda81827bde0b4ee6a77f2e86328d1c7598d108/0_132_5665_3398/master/5665.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa4d41e235658adbea4833875f6d1a2b","title":"baking gardening crochet how the lucky ones lived under lockdown","story":"For those with the time, space and mindset, quarantine has been a chance to learn new skills and enjoy the slower pace“Man is by nature a social animal,” said Aristotle, an observation that for most us has never seemed more perceptive. While lockdown has forced us to embrace Zoom, Houseparty and all the other video call apps, nothing replaces hanging out with friends and family in person.“It’s a deep human need to have that direct social contact and interaction with people,” says Bobby Duffy, professor of public policy at King’s College London. “Human beings are social animals and so we’re trying to substitute face-to-face contact in different ways. The pandemic coming now, in this era where we have social media and video conferencing, has helped – but it is not the same as face-to-face contact. The crisis is making that clear.”“Mothers are much more likely than men to have stopped working at all, either because they have been furloughed, laid off or quit,” says Alison Andrew, an economist for the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “If they have carried on working, they’ve reduced their hours of work by proportionally more than men – and, in any given hour of work, they’re much more likely to be interrupted and also to be doing other things. And the vast majority of those other things are childcare.”The institute surveyed 3,500 families with two opposite-gender parents sharing paid work and domestic responsibilities during the lockdown.“On the other hand, fathers are also doing more childcare and being more actively involved in day-to-day life at home on school days,” Andrew adds. “Even though that’s not brought them up to equality with mothers, by any means, there’s been a huge increase compared to what fathers were doing before. The big unknown is whether that’s purely a temporary thing under lockdown.” Of course, not everyone has had to fight the three-headed beast of work, home-schooling and childcare during the lockdown. An analysis of the skills people are searching for on Google paints a vivid picture of the different ways isolated iniduals have been occupying themselves. Searches for “How to learn sign language” and “How to grow potatoes” have risen dramatically. Pancakes, banana bread and scones are among the most searched-for recipes, according to data provider SEMrush.Mia Livingston is one of them. Since March, she has learned to cook, garden and crochet. She has also weaned herself off the sleeping pills she had been taking for insomnia, is meditating every day and has started working out using a fitness app.“I’m more clear-eyed, energetic and positive since lockdown,” the 47-year-old therapist says. “I’m an introvert, and I think what I always wanted to do was be a homebody. But I was so embarrassed about that. I thought it was unacceptable, and that I always had to be out there socialising. Now I have the perfect excuse to stay in and be cosy, and I’m just so happy.”Dr Elisa Pieri, a sociologist at Manchester University, believes our perception of time has changed during the lockdown. “This terrible crisis has given some people an opportunity to reassess what they want out of life more generally and how they want to arrange their time,” she says. “That ability to refocus our priorities is definitely a positive outcome. We have experienced our sense of vulnerability and the impermanence of life in sharper relief.”Livingston took up crochet when she felt bored after doing a clear-out of her home in west London. Helped along by a YouTube video, she is now midway through crocheting herself a poncho cardigan: “I feel like it’s mental yoga. It’s so calming.”But lots of people will not have had the space and opportunity to take up new hobbies or reflect on how they want to spend their lives. “The lockdown has deepened the ide between people of different socioeconomic status.

Up to 3 million people died, many from starvation, during the conflict, one of the darkest chapters in modern history.“The original acquisition was rooted in violence,” Okeke-Agulu said in an interview. “These objects are from my hometown, removed from places around eastern Nigeria during that war. What we’re seeing now is the continuing benefit from that original act of violence, which is an extension of that violence.”The sculptures, which have an estimated sale price of between €250,000 and €350,0000 (£227,000-£317,000), were acquired from Nigeria by the prolific French art collector Jacques Kerchache.Countless alusi sculptures were systematically looted during the war from Mbari houses – communal shrines lined with symbolic murals and sculptures of Igbo deities.Many artefacts were taken from Okeke-Agulu’s home state of Anambra, the frontline of the war in the majority Igbo south-east of Nigeria. As the conflict raged, local conspirators collaborating with wealthy benefactors engineered the exodus of cultural treasures across the border to Cameroon.“I remember there was deep pain at what the war cost us when it was over,” he said. “I still remember my mother looking through catalogues in the 70s of alusis and important cultural artefacts, most of which were outside of Nigeria.“As an art historian it is a continuing agony that I teach African art. I studied African art at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka and we did not have access to the key artistic monuments of Igbo or Yoruba art..”According to Christie’s, the sculptures were acquired by Kerchache between 1968-69, likely through a Belgian dealer, Phillipe Guimiot, and other local art dealers. “There is no evidence these statues were removed from their original location by someone who was not local to the area,” Christie’s said in a statement. “At no stage since they have been widely known has there been any suggestion that these statues were subject to improper export.”Nigeria’s 1953 Antiquities Ordinance law made the trade of stolen cultural artefacts illegal, and a 1970 Unesco convention signed by Nigeria banned the international trade in stolen artefacts.The alusi statues are among a vast collection amassed by Kechache and sold to a private collector after his death in 2001. Kechache, who advised the late French president Jacques Chirac, was a prominent art figure and helped to found the Musée du Quai Branly-Jacques Chirac in Paris.Okeke-Agulu said Kerchache was a key player in the global market for cultural artefacts who exploited Nigeria’s war.“It does not matter whether Jacques braved the bullets and bombs, went by foot into Biafra and carted away or seized these objects. The main issue is that in a place that was at war, people went in and took away valuable materials of artistic and cultural value and sold them,” he said.Beginning with a rallying Instagram post earlier this month, Okeke-Agulugu has spurred growing awareness of the statues’ origins and opposition to the sale.The loss of cultural objects during the war was immense. Anna Craven worked as an ethnographer and curator at the Nigerian Federal Department of Antiquities in Jos, central Nigeria. In 1970, she was present during a raid where Cameroonian traders were stopped with dozens of cultural artefacts.“There’s been a huge international market for antiquities, particularly Nigerian antiquities, she said. “It sadly continues today.”In the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Black Lives Matter demonstrations have refocused the spotlight on the colonial origins of cultural artefacts in the possession of western art institutions and collectors.Calls for the repatriation of artefacts taken out of Africa in the colonial era have grown more vigorous in recent years, resulting in unprecedented pressure on western galleries and institutions. Yet in practice repatriations have not been radical.Under a deal between the Benin Dialogue Group and 10 European museums, more than 300 Benin bronzes will return to Nigeria in a new gallery to be built by 2023 in Benin City. Most were stolen during violent raids by British soldiers in 1897 and will be loaned back for an initial three years.The conditions for such returns are often perverse, said Okeke-Agulu. “It is like someone stealing your car and then agreeing to return it when they are satisfied with the condition of your garage,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9a79fae8ad8bda49747ccb3abda2839e2591fd6/0_185_5556_3334/master/5556.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcfbd26b9ee2f27864c92ad5add67954","title":"reopened pubs in england may require drinkers to check in","story":"Health secretary refuses to rule out diners and drinkers having to register as they enter venueCustomers in England may be asked to check in when they arrive at pubs and restaurants as part of the the government’s plan for reopening the hospitality sector, Matt Hancock has said.Appearing on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on SkyNews, the health secretary confirmed the government hoped to reopen pubs and restaurants on 4 July, in line with Boris Johnson’s roadmap, published last month.“In that plan, it states that on around 4 July we will take further measures if it is safe to do so. We talk about hospitality and outdoor hospitality in those plans,” he said, adding: “We are clearly on track for that plan.”Asked about reports that ministers are considering plans to ask diners and drinkers to register as they enter a venue, he said: “I wouldn’t rule that out. There are other countries in the world that take that approach.”In New Zealand, the public use their phones to scan codes as they go into hospitality outlets to build up a “digital diary” of where they have been, so that if a new case emerges, anyone who has been at the same outlet can be contacted easily.Johnson’s review into the 2-metre social distancing rule is expected to conclude this week, perhaps as early as Tuesday. Carried out by the No 10 permanent secretary, Simon Case, it has considered scientific advice but also the impact of the rule on the economy.The hospitality industry has been lobbying the government to relax the 2-metre rule, warning that it would make many businesses uneconomic even when they are allowed to reopen – and trigger a fresh wave of job losses.Case is expected to conclude that the blanket 2-metre restriction can be lifted, and replaced with a “1-metre plus” rule, that would allow the public to be closer together, if other safety precautions are taken.Asked about that idea, Hancock said: “That is the sort of thing we’re looking at to how do you make it safe to open things – and as safe as possible, to open as much as possible.“Things like wearing a face mask, which reduces the transmission, clearly how the seating is arranged – because face-to-face is much more dangerous than back-to-back, and there’s much more transmission than side-to-side.”Asked whether hairdressers would be included in the reopening plans, Hancock said: “A lot of the country does need a haircut: we need to do that in a safe way.”People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.With economic data continuing to be dire, Hancock declined to comment on reports that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was considering an emergency cut in VAT in his summer mini-budget to stimulate consumer spending.“That is absolutely a matter for a budget, and you wouldn’t expect me to comment either way on any speculation,” Hancock said. He added, “but the broader point is true, which is that the economy has taken a terrible hit, and we need to get it back on its feet, and give people the confidence to get out there.”A VAT cut would echo a decision made by the former chancellor Alistair Darling, as the economy slid into recession during the global financial crisis in late 2008.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, suggested Labour would back the lifting of the 2-metre rule, if other safety measures were brought in.“Yes, under certain circumstances – but we also need to see a greater use of face masks, I would have thought. For certain staff, workers, who are public facing in their day-to-day action, a greater use of face shielding, let’s get track-and-trace up and running.”He added: “This still remains a deadly virus: we cannot be complacent, so if we are going to relax some measures we need to make sure other mitigation measures are in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4939fd1776cd17bd910b7fb4b09459e7863c882/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f3ed1f5a3f18433f95924da61b2f086","title":"the iconoclast unmasked the man behind far right youtube channel","story":"Former media student Daniel Atkinson used video-sharing platform to influence new generation of rightwing activistsHe is the anonymous architect behind one of the most successful and toxic British far-right YouTube channels, responsible for disseminating racist, Islamophobic and antisemitic material. For years the inidual known as The Iconoclast has managed to protect his identity despite amassing nearly 21m views and more than 218,000 subscribers.However the Observer can reveal that the figure behind one of the biggest far-right content producers in the UK – and the movement’s most prominent anonymous account – is a former media student called Daniel Atkinson.Campaigners said the unmasking of Atkinson was important because he is emblematic of the latest manifestation of the far right.They said it is highly likely his widely disseminated racist views influenced some far-right supporters who clashed with police in central London last weekend.The far-right’s influence has traditionally been consolidated within formal groups and political parties such as the British National Party and English Defence League (EDL). Now, however, its most prominent figures more closely resemble social media influencers such as Atkinson and those who have opted to be identified, for example rightwing commentator Katie Hopkins and far-right YouTuber Paul Joseph Watson, also a senior editor at the conspiracy theory website Infowars. The former leader of the EDL, Tommy Robinson, is another far-right figure who now prefers to produce online content than belong to a particular organisation.After the Observer asked YouTube why it continued to host The Iconoclast, the platform finally moved to close a channel which has operated since 2016 and repeatedly been accused of hate speech. A YouTube spokesperson said: “We share a deep concern and responsibility in protecting the community against hate speech and do not want our platform used for harm. Due to repeated violations of our policies, we have terminated The Iconoclast channel.”Not only had Atkinson’s YouTube channel and magazine steadily attracted an international audience over the years but it also provided a platform for a number of high-profile and extreme figures on the global far right.Among these are US writer Brittany Pettibone, who views immigration as “white genocide” and in 2018 was banned from entering Britain. Another is antisemitic white supremacist Colin Robertson – aka Millennial Woes – who has described himself as “pro-slavery” and demanded the torpedoing of refugee boats.On Friday night anti-fascist groups celebrated the removal of one of the most isive channels on YouTube. Gregory Davis, researcher at anti-extremism pressure group Hope Not Hate said: “The Iconoclast is the perfect example of the threat posed by the modern far-right. It operated online and anonymously and outside of any formal far-right organisation but managing to reach huge numbers of people around the world.”Extreme even by the standards of most far-right YouTubers, Atkinson actively promoted the idea of “voluntary repatriation” for the UK’s minority ethnic population. In a video uploaded to YouTube in April, he showed clips of an interview with Enoch Powell talking about measures that could encourage voluntary repatriation. Atkinson agreed, saying they would “create an atmosphere that may make leaving Britain seem a more attractive option”.Such views are similar to those expressed by Generation Identity, a far-right racial separatist group that Atkinson has promoted on his channel and whose ideology is said by some to have inspired the mass shooter in the Christchurch mosque attack, which killed 51 people in March 2019.Another video on The Iconoclast, published on 5 April and attracting more than 50,000 views, reveals Atkinson’s dismay at suggestions that Rishi Sunak, the Southampton-born chancellor of the exchequer, may be the next prime minister.Uncovering Atkinson’s identity involved forensic analysis of his social media output, including repeated usernames, profile pictures, throwaway comments that corroborated biographical details shared in his YouTube videos and undeleted accounts. One closed TikTok account linked to Atkinson has a profile blurb that simply states: “I’m racist.”YouTube has intervened on a number of occasions, removing one video from Atkinson’s channel as recently as 4 June. The video made several racist statements about black people and the Black Lives Matter protests, including one claim that the demonstrations proved Enoch Powell was right to say that the “black man will have the whip hand over the white man”.Last August his YouTube account was temporarily removed for violating the platform’s guidelines along with prominent anti-Islamic extremist Martin Sellner, who has also been banned from the UK. However, both were reinstated with no apparent explanation from YouTube other than apparently that it had been “the wrong call”, a decision that caused global controversy. Days earlier, YouTube’s chief executive said it had to be open to hosting “controversial” ideas.Commenting after YouTube had terminated his channel, Atkinson said: “As it stands, your article will paint me in a certain light, and the video samples you have chosen will be the only representation of my wider work, which the public can no longer access.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2401aa0e8d6dc0c8c9e1600cac04de4e0c3b5a0/0_286_5006_3003/master/5006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48bf0bef8c476b7205c12d71210aaeaf","title":"us russia nuclear disarmament talks to begin but no sign of china joining in","story":"Uncertainty surrounds talks slated to begin in Vienna on Monday, with US desperate to get China to the tableThe US and Russia will restart talks about their nuclear arsenals on Monday after a break of more than a year and uncertainty over whether Donald Trump is interested in salvaging arms control in the last four months before elections.Trump’s new US arms control envoy, Marshall Billingslea will lead a delegation to meet the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov in Vienna, and has also asked for Beijing to send a representative.“The United States has extended an open invitation to the People’s Republic of China to join these discussions, and has made clear the need for all three countries to pursue arms control negotiations in good faith,” the state department said.Trump has been insistent that China join what has for decades been bilateral dialogue, but the Chinese government has refused. Its stockpile, currently estimated by the Federation of American Scientists at 320 warheads, is less than a twentieth the size of the US or Russian arsenal.“The time is not yet ripe for China to participate in nuclear disarmament negotiations,” China’s foreign ministry spokesman said earlier this month.Billingslea replied in a tweet: “China … should reconsider. Achieving Great Power status requires behaving with Great Power responsibility. No more Great Wall of Secrecy on its nuclear buildup. Seat waiting for China in Vienna.”On the table at the expected two days of talks in the Austrian capital is the 2010 New Start treaty, which limits the number of US and Russian deployed strategic warheads (those mounted on long-range delivery systems) to 1,550 each. The treaty will expire next February but it can easily be extended for a further five years. Vladimir Putin has said he is ready to extend, but the Trump administration has yet to make a final decision.US officials have said they want a wider agreement covering non-strategic weapons and even more stringent verification, as well as Chinese participation. Any such changes would require months, if not years to achieve.If New Start is allowed to expire there will be no remaining agreed limits on the proliferation of nuclear weapons for the first time in nearly half a century.“Clearly the administration is trying to find any way they can to put pressure on the Chinese to show up and engage. And the Chinese are clearly feeling no pressure to do this, nor do the Russians really want to play along,” said a US congressional aide. “So that part is going nowhere.”America’s allies are lobbying the Trump administration to agree to an extension while encouraging China to join broader arms control negotiations. When Billingslea laid out his approach in a video conference presentation to a meeting of member state ambassadors at the North Atlantic Council (NAC), in May, there was little enthusiasm for the US approach“He was very clear that President Trump was prioritizing trilateral arms control, and that he felt he had a mandate to go out and get this done,” a western diplomat said. “The allies very much want the administration to extend New Start, sooner rather than later. They’re worried that the administration is going to get overly focused on China, and not use this time to extend New Start.“Those concerns were raised in a respectful way, and Billingslea was very clear that there had not been any decisions made yet on New Start,” the diplomat said.The NAC meeting came the day after Trump had announced his attention to withdraw from another arms control agreement, the Open Skies Treaty, which allows Russia, the US and 32 other countries to make surveillance flights over each territory, with the aim of building conference and transparency. Trump pulled out on the grounds that Russia was violating the agreement by putting limits on overflights. European allies argued such infringements could be addressed and were not worth jeopardising the security benefits of the agreement.“I think allies, really committed to doing what they could to bring you know to bring Russia back into compliance, so that the US would be able to consider walking back their decision,” the western diplomat said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cdca89a524c74f1a37024bd2456ec27ed3eaa97/0_115_7416_4450/master/7416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aba0cd8bc8b4efc418a89fed11d87c35","title":"xi plays tough but can china afford to make an enemy of india","story":"The brutal ambush in the Himalayas is the latest aggressive move from Beijing by a nation battling crises on several fronts The ambush set up by Chinese soldiers for an Indian patrol was medieval. In the high-altitude Himalayan no man’s land claimed by both countries, their forces have agreed not to carry guns, to diminish the chance of the long-running territorial dispute flaring into open war.So the People’s Liberation Army had dammed up mountain streams, which they unblocked as the Indian troops approached. The rush of water knocked many off their feet, and then the Chinese soldiers swept down, brandishing sticks encrusted with nails, Indian media reported.The units fought hand to hand for hours several Indians tumbled down the mountain to their death. When the battle was over, at least 20 Indian soldiers were dead, dozens more injured and several taken captive. China had losses too, although it has not revealed figures.A fragile consensus that had held for nearly half a century was also killed off. Before last week’s battle, no soldier from either side had died in a border skirmish for 45 years.China and India fought a war over the border in 1962, and clashed again in 1967, but both seemed keen to avoid incidents that could spiral towards another.Then there was Monday’s ambush, which left two nuclear-armed nationalist strongmen – Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping – facing off over the bodies of their troops. It was a potentially explosive situation. Neither man’s politics allows much room to look weak on issues of national sovereignty and territorial control.On Saturday, China accused India of “deliberate provocation”, and criticised its construction of infrastructure in the area. But India’s construction has been well inside the territory it controls.The mountainside battle came after a steady build-up of Chinese forces and infrastructure, and an increase in reported patrols, around the line of actual control (LAC), the de facto border – an area that commanders know carries risks of escalation.“This appears to be a far more concerted push on China’s part to change the status quo,” said Andrew Small, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. He cautioned that information about the border areas was fragmentary, and mostly from Indian sources supplemented by satellite images, but said there was a clear picture of a growing Chinese presence.“The Chinese military has been hardening its position in multiple locations, not simply conducting patrols across the LAC but building infrastructure and maintaining an ongoing presence.”It also seems improbable that commanders on a contested frontier, where there had been serious brawls a month earlier, would plan such a deadly ambush without at least tacit approval from the highest levels.Yet it is not an obvious time for Beijing to be stirring up trouble with its neighbour the country is battling several crises. Its economy has been shattered by coronavirus. Relations with the United States are at one of their lowest points since diplomatic ties were re-established in the 1970s. Hong Kong is in revolt and Beijing’s imposition of a security law there has provoked international outrage.Chinese authorities have also launched a trade war with Australia over its demands for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, and are in a stand-off with Canada over the extradition of a senior executive from the technology giant Huawei.Some analysts believe that aggression on the Indian border is a response to these domestic pressures, from a leader who has fumbled the economy and relations with a top trading partner desperate not to look weak on national sovereignty.“I feel it’s generally a response to the pressure Xi feels he is under,” said Taylor Fravel, director of the security studies programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Others see a more opportunistic aggression from a government which over the past decade has replaced a focus on economic priorities and global stability in its foreign policy with aggressive nationalism.Forced to choose between acceptance and escalation, no country has wanted to take on China. Comments from Modi on Friday suggested that he too was willing to pay a political price to avoid further escalation.He said in a televised statement that Chinese troops had not intruded across the country’s borders, even though that directly contradicted his own foreign minister’s previous position.“From the Chinese point of view, why not push forward?” said June Dreyer, professor of political science at the University of Miami. China’s economy is five times the size of India’s, and its official defence budget $100bn (£80bn) higher the real difference is probably larger, she pointed out.But while protests in India’s streets and threats to boycott Chinese goods are unlikely to have a major economic impact, and there is little threat of military action, Beijing may have underestimated the damage caused by this skirmish.“One of the things this crisis has taught us is that the Chinese understanding of India is quite poor and is often coloured by cognitive biases of all kinds,” said Ashley Tellis, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and former senior adviser to the US state department.The deaths, and the end of the tacit agreement to avoid fatalities, are likely to harden attitudes towards China, both in the general population and among politicians. And that could have long-term fallouts, both economically and diplomatically.“I suspect China has lost another generation, in India, many of whom had seen China as an opportunity. Basically, now they will say we can’t trust them,” said Tanvi Madan, director of the India project at the Brookings Institution in Washington.“Even if there was already an internal debate, this has strengthened the hands of those who have called for a rethinking,” she said. “One thing this will put an end to is the idea that economic interdependence is going to alleviate political strains.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85d12688543d9666aaa12d067a1e946578e5b73d/0_125_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90545ff0fc3463395624ed7593148ecf","title":"yemen separatists seize island of socotra from saudi backed government","story":"Southern Transitional Council has taken control of remote archipelago in the Arabian SeaYemeni separatists have seized control of the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea, deposing its governor and driving out the forces of the Saudi-backed government, which condemned the action as a coup.The Southern Transitional Council (STC) declared self-rule in the south of the country in April, complicating UN efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire in a war that has separatists and the government fighting as nominal allies in a Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels, who control the north.On Saturday, the STC announced it had seized government facilities and military bases on the main island of Socotra, a sparsely populated archipelago which sits at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden on one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.The government, which is led by President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, condemned the action as a “full-fledged” coup and accused STC forces of attacking government buildings in “gang-style behaviour”.The Socotra governor, Ramzi Mahroos, accused coalition leaders Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of turning a blind eye. The UAE has previously backed STC forces with airstrikes in fighting against the government in the south.The coalition’s Saudi spokesman and the UAE foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.Yemen\u0026nbsphas been troubled by civil wars for decades, but the current conflict intensified in March 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened on behalf of the internationally recognised government against Houthi rebels aligned with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.Its roots lie in the Arab spring. Pro-democracy protesters took to the streets in a bid to force the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to end his 33-year rule. He responded with economic concessions but refused to resign.By March 2011, tensions on the streets of the capital city, Sana’a, resulted in protesters dying at the hands of the military.Following an internationally brokered deal, there was a transfer of power in November to the vice-president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, paving the way for elections in February 2012 – in which he was the only candidate to lead a transitional government. Hadi’s attempts at constitutional and budget reforms were rejected by Houthi rebels from the north.The Houthis captured the capital, forcing Hadi to flee eventually to Riyadh.Sources told Reuters last week that Saudi Arabia, which has tried to broker a deal between the STC and Hadi’s government, had presented a proposal to end the separatist standoff, but the STC subsequently denied receiving it.Riyadh wants to prevent another front developing in Yemen’s multifaceted war, which has been locked in military stalemate for years.The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government for power in the capital, Sana’a, in late 2014. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.Socotra, a Unesco world heritage site due to its unique fauna and flora, is located in the shipping lane linking Asia to the Europe via the Red Sea and Suez canal.

We need to be stronger than that.”Ms Bailey, a South Belfast MLA, is the latest in a number of high-profile party members from across the island to oppose the draft programme.On Sunday she and Green TDs Francis Duffy, Patrick Costello and Neasa Hourigan, who are opposed to the deal, as well as councillor and party chair Hazel Chu and councillor Lorna Bogue, and 2020 general election candidates Sean McCabe and Saoirse McHugh, released a joint statement announcing that they would vote against the draft programme for government.They said they believed the deal “represents an unjust recovery” and “one of the most fiscally conservative arrangements in a generation.“Regressive taxation in the form of carbon and sugar taxes are included while corporation tax and the top rate of income tax remain unchanged.“It’s a deal that was negotiated in good faith but fails to deliver on our promise to tackle homelessness and provide better healthcare. It sets out an inadequate and vague pathway towards climate action.“A better deal is possible - voting no on this programme for government is a step towards securing that better deal.“Transformative change was called for by the electorate earlier this year. That call must be answered by not only the Green Party, but every party that promised positive change,” they said.Responding to the statement on Sunday, Green party leader Eamon Ryan told RTE Radio said it is possible for the next government to address climate and bioersity crisis as well as social justice issues such as access to housing and health.Mr Ryan said if it is rejected by party members on Friday it is very uncertain what would happen next. “I don’t believe it would be possible or in the national interest to go into another prolonged negotiation process” but he did not think it would be an immediate election due to the Covid-19 crisis.A total of 195 of the Northern Greens’ 800 members - or just under a quarter - have registered to vote on the draft programme for government.Ms Bailey abstained from the parliamentary party’s vote on the programme for government last week, and is the first of the Greens’ elected representatives in the North to publicly state her position on the document.None of their businessHowever indications among the party grass roots were that the Northern Greens were opposed to draft programme because, as one source put it, “it’s a wee bit too much save the planet, screw the people.”Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Politics show, Ms Bailey said her preferred option was to “build back a better deal. I don’t think it’s this deal or nothing, I think there are other options that need to be explored, so we can have another deal, we can review this deal, we can push it a bit further, we can talk to other parties, so it’s not one or the other.”However Ms Bailey rejected the suggestion that only a quarter had registered to vote because the majority felt the formation of a government in another jurisdiction was “none of their business”, and said that it was due to the short deadline and the coronavirus lockdown.“We’re an all-island party and we do have this way of working,” she said.Ms Bailey said her position on the draft programme for government were “in no way” a reflection on the Greens’ negotiating team.“I think that they have done a fantastic job and we have seen that reflected in some aspects within the programme for government, but still we feel the programme for government is really leading to a unjust recovery,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"China says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4284596.1592667872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"italian sewage study suggests covid 19 was there in december","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A staff member checks the temperature of a moviegoer wearing a face mask during the reopening of the Massimo cinema in Turin. Photograph:Tino RomanoEPA Scientists in Italy have found traces of the new coronavirus in wastewater collected from Milan and Turin in December 2019 - suggesting Covid-19 was already circulating in northern Italy before China reported the first cases.The Italian National Institute of Health looked at 40 sewage samples collected from wastewater treatment plants in northern Italy between October 2019 and February 2020. An analysis released on Thursday said samples taken in Milan and Turin on December 18th showed the presence of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.“This research may help us understand the beginning of virus circulation in Italy,” said Giuseppina La Rosa, an expert in environmental wastewater at the Italian National Institute of Health who co-led the research.A spokeswoman for the institute said the full data and study would be published next week.Research in the Netherlands, France, Australia and elsewhere has found signs that the virus that causes Covid-19 can be detected in sewage, and many countries are beginning to sample wastewater to track the disease.Scientists said the detection of traces of the virus before the end of 2019 was consistent with evidence in other countries that Covid-19 may have been circulating before China reported the first cases on December 31st.Noel McCarthy, an expert in population evidence and technologies at Britain’s Warwick Medical School, said the detection of SARS-Cov-2 genetic material in Italian wastewater in December was “reliable evidence of cases of Covid-19 being present there at that time”.Rowland Kao, an epidemiology and data professor at Scotland’s Edinburgh University, agreed it was plausible the disease could have circulating then, but added: “(This finding) does not on its own, however, tell us if that early detection was the source of the very large epidemic in Italy, or if that was due to a later introduction into the country.”A study in May by French scientists found that a man was infected with Covid-19 as early as December 27th, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases.La Rosa said the presence of the virus in the Italian waste samples did not “automatically imply that the main transmission chains that led to the development of the epidemic in our country originated from these very first cases”.Samples positive for traces of the virus that causes Covid-19 were also found in sewage from Bologna, Milan and Turin in January and February 2020. Samples taken in October and November 2019 tested negative.The institute said it plans to launch a pilot study in July to monitor wastewater in tourist resorts. -Reuters Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"britons dubai sell possessions return home coronavirus ends","story":"Dubai’s expat community groups are full of bargains everything from cars to gym subscriptions. The fire sales are a result of expats left jobless by the UAE’s coronavirus lock-down. Among them, thousands of British expats are trying to scrape back the pennies before they are forced to leave a place many call home.The coronavirus lockdown has upended the lives of thousands of expats, turning their dream of a life abroad into a nightmare of uncertainty. Thousands have been made redundant, with strict visa regulations forcing them to return to the UK, with little time to catch their breath.  It’s almost 11 years since Selina Dixon traded her claustrophobic commute from Surrey into Central London for her expat dreams of Dubai.“I was spending four hours a day on the train,” she tells The .The fashion marketer left behind the early morning drizzle and commuter grind, for a new life in the UAE. One which promised year-round sun, tax-free salaries, and the opportunity of adventure.“It’s not about the glitz and glamour, whoever has been fortunate enough to live here know there is much more behind the façade,” she says.An estimated 240,000 Britons call the UAE home, working as everything from air hostesses to teachers.Dixon was made redundant a few weeks ago, now she is living off her meagre savings. In weeks her visa will expire, and she wont be able to renew it unless she finds a new job.“Every day you wake up, you’re looking on LinkedIn. Speaking to contacts and your network, but then you have to be mindful there are so many people going through this.”With thousands of people flying in and out of the UAE every day in normal times, the country was always vulnerable to Covid-19. A  stringent lockdown saw swathes of the economy shut. Though some 40,000 cases of the virus have been registered, Dubai is slowly beginning to open up, yet the economic recovery will likely take many years.Ninety per cent of the UAE’s population are expats, and a study out this month by Oxford Economics, a quantitative analysis firm, estimates that the country of nine million could lose up to 900,000 jobs, and some 10 per cent of its population – British expats are likely to be among the worst affected.At least part of the difficulty lies in the UAE’s Kafala – or sponsorship - system. A visa scheme wherein residency is tied to your job. Companies may sponsor a foreigner for residency as long as they employ them, but the moment someone becomes unemployed, a count-down begins on the expiry of their visa.As Dixon says, “Dubai is a place that without a visa - it’s difficult.”Though the government has announced some visa waivers, those who have lost their jobs since March 1st have thirty days to find a new job, or their visas become invalid, and they will be hit with daily fines.It means that those like Dixon may be forced to return to the UK for the first time in years. “It was not a choice that I was ready to make, but one that I may have to make.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"first nightclub british isles opens doors guernsey sports teams","story":"Late into the night, more than 400 young people will squeeze their way into a Guernsey nightclub to revel in a pastime once banned as a dangerous threat to public health. The DJ will power up the 50,000-watt sound system and dazzling lighting rig as the crowd are expected to dance without a care in the world for social distancing.Those youngsters will become the first people to visit a nightclub in the British Isles since the coronavirus lockdown in March.Fusion Night Club has, like so many other businesses on Guernsey, opened for the first time on Friday as islanders celebrated reaching ‘Phase Five’ of its success story in defeating Covid-19, way ahead of the UK and many other European countries.Bars, restaurants, museums and libraries which had been allowed to open since May 30 no longer had to enforce one or two metre distancing zones, one-way systems or collect customers contact details for possible track and tracing. All of that rigmarole was scrapped as the Visit Guernsey website declared: “We are proud to be the first place in the British Isles declared coronavirus free.”As Alex Lock, the nightclub owner (pictured below), prepared to unlock his club doors for the first time in three months he said he had hired extra security and bar staff in anticipation of up to 1,000 people turning up for the coronavirus-free party.“I did decide to open a little bit earlier to ensure I was the first nightclub to open,” he said. “This will be bigger than the Saturday before Christmas. People will probably get a little bit over excited and order a few more drinks than they would normally.“There will be no tourists, not even any ‘yachties’ from France. But, everyone on the island knows each other, so it will be a meeting up of friends. There are definitely going to be some on the pull though.”Guernsey, which has a population of about 65,000 people, went into lockdown on March 25, just after detecting its first case of community transmission of the virus. Inhabitants have nothing but praise for the deputies - or politicians - from the States of Guernsey government who set out a clear map to defeat the virus and return to “business as usual”. The sixth and final phase will see the two-week quarantine for visitors tourists lifted, although no date has yet been set for when that is possible. The island had only 13 Covid-19 deaths. It has been 52 days since the last case was detected. Deputy Gavin St Pier, Guernsey’s chief minister who gave the government briefings about their six phase plan, said closing the borders early, boosting their testing capacity as well as tackling care homes experiencing clusters of cases had been the key to success.  “Life is back to normal in what we call the island bubble of Guernsey,” he said, diplomatically refusing to comment on how “other jurisdictions” - such as the British government - had handled the virus. “Clearly being an island is helpful,” he said. “We locked down our borders on March 19 and imposed a 14 day quarantine to visitors. That was the single most important step. Then on March 25, after the first case of community transmission was detected, we locked down the entire island.”He added how “constant, clear and consistent messages” helped carry the islanders  along with them, although he admitted there were bound to have been mistakes and lessons that can be learned. At the Balthazar Bar and Restaurant, now open to full capacity, staff celebrated reaching Phase Five of lifting lockdown by wearing specially printed Tee-shirts bearing the slogan, ‘Five … is the magic number’.“I thought it would be September or October before we got to stage five,” said Steve Le Poidevin, the restaurant owner. “I think the island is really proud of itself for having done so well.”On Friday, the Beau Sejour Leisure Centre issued a jubilant press release announcing how it will become the first public community leisure complex in the British Isles to return to “business as usual” on Monday.Like most schools and colleges, the leisure centre opened partially in early June with strict social distancing rules, including asking swimmers to arrive wearing their swimming costumes and to change at the poolside.Matt Fallaize, local politician and president of the committee for education, sport and culture, could barely contain his glee. “The fact the centre is gearing up for normal opening at a time when leisure centres in other parts of the British Isles continue to struggle and remain closed is a great testament to the fantastic Guernsey together community spirit that has been demonstrated throughout this pandemic.”Even the Guernsey organisers of yesterday’s first Black Lives Matters march had abandoned plans for an earlier protest after accepting warnings that mass gatherings with limited social distancing could jeopardise reaching Phase Five. Contact sports including rugby and football clubs can now resume, although teams are governed still by associations that have not lifted UK-wide restrictions. But if the Guernsey Raiders Rugby Football Club wanted to clash with old rivals they would find teams on the UK mainland are a long way from lifting lockdown.Steve Melbourne, director of Island Rugby Guernsey at Guernsey Rugby Association, said: “The issue is we can’t go to the UK to play and you can’t get teams to Guernsey because they would have to have 14 days quarantine,” he said. “Rugby is a sociable sport. It’s been difficult for the guys to not be able to get together. We’ve missed simple things like shaking hands.”Chris Gnapp, sponsorship director at the club, said he remained “hopeful” the new season will start in September but ‘contact training’ was going ahead in preparation for a sevens rugby tournament between local teams in August.On Monday, some 175 children will attend the first academy training session run by the Guernsey Football Association, with competitive friendly matches likely to commence on July 1. Guernsey FA’s chief executive, Gary Roberts, added: “There is a lot of excitement and enthusiasm about beginning to resume football from players of all ages, as well as among coaches, referees and club officials.”Back at the nightclub, Mr Lock explains how not since World War II when the island was occupied by the Nazi Germans had pubs, clubs and restaurants been closed. “I guess we were under occupation from a virus. Not anymore,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must resist statist culture sweeping lockdown britain","story":"The latest US employment figures make grim reading. The Covid-19 recession has prompted 46 million new applications for unemployment aid in just over three months and heartbreaking news footage shows mile-long queues for job centres and food stamps. In Britain, furloughed workers still count as “employed” so don’t register on our own official statistics. But our day of reckoning cannot be far behind.The furlough scheme is a sensible concept – when the state bars workers from their livelihoods, it is naturally obliged to support them. But this well-intentioned policy has cushioned us from reality. It reminds me of one of the Looney Tunes skits from my childhood Wile E Coyote runs off the cliff, defying gravity for a few seconds, only to fall when he looks down. Soon we will all look down and the sight will be horrifying.Politicians have barely acknowledged the perverse incentives of paying people 80 per cent of their salary not to work, move jobs, or start a business, or the risk of throwing good money after bad – either by propping up “zombie” firms or simply postponing necessary economic readjustments. An allegedly Conservative Government has decided that prosperity lies in shovelling ever more QE onto an increasing debt load at the expense of future generations.With the economy still mothballed, the risk of permanent scarring, and a wholesale change in attitude rises by the day. Given the looming social disorder – the widening inequalities caused by depriving our poorest pupils of an education and lumbering future generations with a cheque it will take a lifetime to repay – the damage will be with us for years.Yet opinion polls suggest many are relishing confinement and dependence on the state. The furious reaction to the merger of Dfid with the Foreign Office shows how quickly policies can metamorphose into inalienable rights and institutions. All year round school meal vouchers may soon be seen in the same light. Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government programme.The sense of welfarism appears endemic Cornish councillors are urging tourists (and their money) to stay away all summer, insisting that the taxpayer will pick up the tab for any lost revenue. Even the public’s cries for ever-more clarity from the government  (“What does ‘stay alert’ mean, anyway?”) suggest a reluctance to exercise rational thought. Some seem to hold Ministers directly responsible for every death caused by the virus – assuming that the state should not just support you, but confer immortality.True, not everyone has capitulated. One tough-minded businessman boldly vows to reopen his chain of pubs next month, with or without the green light from the Government. Major supermarkets and supply chains have rapidly adapted to a challenging new situation. But the national mood seems submissive.With legions of Left-wingers using this crisis to try to realise their statist aims, we cannot allow such attitudes to fester. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"slavery plunder do nothing create wealth liberty can achieve","story":"Amid the rows about slavery and statues, a truly terrible idea is going unchallenged: the claim that Britain became rich through plunder. Those who defend the monuments tend to let this assertion pass, instead taking their stand on the rule of law, public order and respect for the past. But the notion that the British Empire was a racket, that this country grew fat on stolen resources and enslavement, is not just false it is dangerous, for it encourages the delusion that the wealth depends on accumulation rather than exchange.If forced labour made a nation rich, history would look very different. Every civilisation – every civilisation – was built on slavery, with all its inherent horrors and cruelties. The Sumerians were slavers. The Babylonians were slavers. So were the Assyrians, Akkadians, Egyptians, Greeks, Hittites, Persians, Phoenicians and Romans. So were the Arabs, Chinese, Mongols, Turks, Maori, Polynesians, Africans, Mayans, Aztecs and Incas. None of these peoples experienced the extraordinary rises in living standards we have seen over the past two centuries.Empire was the normal form of social organisation from around 8,000 years ago until the late twentieth century. If annexation and looting were the way to wealth, we might have expected an industrial revolution to happen under Alexander the Great or Tamurlane. But, though empire may have suited the emperors, it brought little benefit to their subjects.If neither slavery nor empire made nations rich, what did? Something must have caused the 3,000 per cent increase in living standards we have seen over the past two centuries and, as the economic historian Deirdre McCloskey puts it, it was not the gradual accretion of capital, “the piling of brick on brick or bachelor’s degree on bachelor’s degree”.No, what prompted “the great enrichment” was a change in our values and our behaviour. We began to think of society as being made up of iniduals, not castes. We stopped disdaining enterprise. We protected physical and intellectual property.Matt Ridley, author of a brilliant new book called “How Innovation Works”, explains that, in primitive societies, manpower was the chief source of energy. Ancient emperors amassed slaves because it was the only way to maintain their living standards. When someone discovered that a barrel of oil could do the work of fifty men, without needing to be fed or housed, slavery became redundant. Human nature being what it is, only then did people begin to heed the ethical arguments for abolition.It is certainly true that iniduals did well out of imperialism. India was conquered by rough adventurers who ended up seizing the tax revenues of entire provinces. The writer and politician Sashi Tharoor argues that British rule seriously impeded economic development in India – though that argument is harder to make about, say, Singapore or Hong Kong.The fact that the empire was bad for India does not mean it was good for Britain. On the contrary, it was a lose-lose relationship – a net drain on Britain’s exchequer as well as a burden on India. While there were inidual beneficiaries, both among the British settlers and among their allied maharajahs, the arrangement as a whole was costly. Plenty of people saw it at the time.Lord Macaulay, for example, argued in 1833 that the sooner India could be brought to wealth and self-rule, the better for all sides: “To trade with civilized men is infinitely more profitable than to govern savages. That would, indeed, be a doting wisdom, which, in order that India might remain a dependency, would make it a useless and costly dependency”.Slavery lingers today in the poorest places on Earth, notably North Korea and parts of Africa. In countries that embrace free markets, servitude becomes both unthinkable (because liberal societies are based on the elevation of the inidual) and uneconomic (because you activate a force more powerful than any number of slaves every time you flick a light switch).

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Temperatures are cooler in the northwest and warmer in the southeast, reaching around 22C in London.However, showers may be more persistent in northeast Scotland, at times heavy, and slow to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAfter a clear but chilly night for many areas tonight, the Met Office expects the coming week to bathe in the warm weather and plenty of sunshine.Deputy chief meteorologist Martin Young said: “By the middle of next week we’ll see temperatures across much of England and Wales widely climbing into the mid to high 20s Celsius and it will probably be hot in parts of southern and eastern England, as temperatures peak close to 30C.Everything you need to know about the summer solstice“It’s possible Northern Ireland and Scotland will join the rest of the country in seeing a spell of warmer weather later next week, as this hot air from the continent extends northwards across the UK.”However, forecasters warn the hot air may result in “severe thunderstorms” later in the week.The UK observed the summer solstice on Saturday and were treated to 16 hours and 38 minutes of daylight.After yesterday, the nights will begin to get longer as the Earth rotates, tilting the northern hemisphere away from the sun.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Matt Hancock has spoken out about why he broke his own social distancing rules this week, after video footage from inside the House of Commons showed him reaching past yellow hazard tape used to keep politicians two metres apart — and patting someone on the back as he walked into the chamber.When asked about the incident by Nick Robinson, filling in for Mr Marr on the BBC’s weekly political programme The Andrew Marr Show, the health secretary said: “It was just totally natural. This shows how difficult social distancing is. I know these rules inside out.“I hadn’t seen my colleague for weeks and I really like him!” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen probed by Mr Robinson, who suggested anyone watching the video might feel “it’s one rule for you and one rule for somebody else”, Mr Hancock apologised, saying: “I’m incredibly sorry for this momentary breach — it’s because I’m human.”Mr Hancock himself has already contracted and recovered from the virus once, having displayed mild symptoms at the same time Boris Johnson was hospitalised in March.Scientists believe there is a likelihood those infected will carry some immunity — however, there is so far no conclusive evidence that someone who has contracted the virus is unable to catch it again.Government to announce further lockdown easing this week, Hancock saysThe health secretary also confirmed to Mr Robinson that the government will “bring forward proposals” to reduce the two-metre social distancing rule. He said: “The proposals we’ll bring forward are how you can safely reduce the two metre with the sort of mitigations we’ve been talking about.”But while Mr Hancock said he “very much hopes” to reduce the distance, he also said the government would only make changes “in a way that is safe and doesn’t lead to a resurgence of the virus”.As it stands, the guidance from Mr Hancock’s department still clearly states that the public “should keep two metres apart from people not in your household or support bubble at all times”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

IMeanwhile, in London it is between . and ..There are lots of infection control measures experts can use to push this number down and reduce the spread.A study in the Lancet in April, for example, estimated that travel restrictions in Wuhan caused R to drop from . to . after just one week.  The social distancing measures introduced in the UK have had a substantial impact so far.This is because as less people come into contact with one another, there is a lower chance for the virus to spread.More generally, a vaccination would help reduce the R rate of any given disease as this would mean that one infected person wouldnt be able to infect an inidual who had been given a vaccination.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is something her devoted husband, Scott Mitchell, has been dreading.The couple married in  with some cynics snfily declaring it would never last, mainly because of the -year age gap, but Scott proved them all completely wrong.He adores his we and has put his le on hold, and his physical and mental health at risk, to take care of his Barbara.Scott has also helped to raise funds and awareness for dementia charities, even taking part in the London Marathon with a group of Barbara’s friends from EastEnders.It has been deeply sad to see how this disease has ravaged one of the most delightful women in showbiz.I always adored interviewing Barbara. She was sunny, funny, full of fascinating stories and always interested in everyone and everything.She would have a laugh with the crew, a cheery chat with our production team and was exactly the same whether the cameras were rolling or not.I know a lot of famous actors and entertainers who are grumpy gits until the red light goes on. Barbara was never like that. She is a consummate professional, but also a delightfully warm human being.I remember seeing her at an event in London, where she was swamped by photographers and members of the public. She’s so tiny I couldn’t actually see her in that large sea of people, but what I did observe was how everyone came away with an autograph or a selfie.Barbara is old school. She always said she owes her fame to the public and that they deserved a smile, a cheery wave and a quick photograph.That’s why she is so adored and why we are so very upset she is having to go through this anguish. Scott says her speech is growing worse and she now struggles to find the words to express herself.She ends up sitting shaking her head in sadness and frustration. Barbara is also getting up two or three times a night, becoming unsteady on her feet and falling over. Scott is worried sick that she will suffer a really serious injury.Sometimes Barbara looks at old photos of herself and asks, “Who is she ” and increasingly she doesn’t recognise Scott, which cuts him to his very heart and soul.This disease is so brutal, because it chips away at the sufferer, steals their memories and erodes what makes them unique. You gradually lose the person you love and have to mourn them while they are still alive. That’s why the work both Scott and Barbara have been doing is so vital.When she bravely told us she was ill two years ago, the Alzheimer’s Society saw visits to its website double and one-off donations to the charity rose by  per cent.She made a plea to the PM to help carers and sufferers, and to increase funding, and Barbara was one of the few people that made Boris Johnson stop waffling and actually listen.Dementia is a second epidemic within this pandemic, which is why we need more documentaries like the ones from Ross.There are , sufferers that we know about in the UK, and with us all living longer that number will carry on increasing.Relatives caring for those blighted by the disease can often feel alone and helpless. GPs and the NHS do their best, but it can be a lottery as to what expert care is available.As we have seen during this crisis, care home workers are an extraordinary group of people who treat their frail and elderly patients like a second family, but no one really wants to put a beloved parent or partner into a nursing home.There comes a time, however, when there is no other choice. Scott is now facing that prospect and it is tearing him apart. I also spoke this week to the musician Naughty Boy, whose mum Zahida suffers from dementia.He is a devoted son and lives with his mum to take care of her. Naughty Boy is backing Dementia UK’s Lives On Hold campaign, which focuses on carers and how draining it is for them, especially since lockdown. He wants to stress that there is help out there.

In Game Of Thrones, the characters are willing to die before they would BEND the knee in front of despots and royalty.In the real world it’s about expressing solidarity against racial inequality.Raab believes the heartfelt gesture is a “symbol of subjugation and subordination” and he would only do so for the Queen and his we. Those who take the knee, including footballers at theof the Premier League this week, and many protesters here and in the US, were astounded by his crass remarks.Following such wide­spread incredulity and anger, Raab has been furiously back-tracking. I do hope his Twitter clarication is genuine and not just another Government damage-limitation tactic.If this really was an episode of Game Of Thrones, he would have had his a*** handed to him by my favourite character, Sandor Clegane, known as The Hound.After that encounter, I guarantee he would never again be able to bend any part of his anatomy.HOLLYOAKS actor Adam Rickitt is an astonishingly candid and brave man. He not only spoke about his mental health at a time when it was considered career-destroying, but has talked frankly this week about being infertile.Adam suffers from an auto-immune disease that has made it impossible for him to ever father children. The -year-old has ankylosing spondylitis, which has had a devastating effect on his sperm count.While other men might have felt embarrassed about it, Adam has been refreshingly honest. He revealed the doctor told him most men have three million sperm, but he only had two. Not two million but TWO.He and his we Katy Fawcett, a top correspondent with Good Morning Britain, are very happy with their three dogs. Adam has been equally upfront about his mental health and suicidal thoughts. Since meeting Katy in  his le has turned around and, alongside acting jobs, he’s running a craft beer bar and shop. The couple call it their “baby”.They adore each other and are lucky to feel complete without kids.GWYNETH PALTROW’S latest attention- seeking wheeze is to bring out a candle that “smells of her orgasm”. This is a follow-up to last year’s model that bore the catchy title, “This candle smells of my vagina”.Not sure about you, but I have no wish to have my living room reeking of Gywn or anything to do with her sex le.I also cannot begin to imagine the sheer buttock-clenching embarrassment suffered by her two teenage kids.I think what her candles really smell of are pure unadulterated bulls**t.THE Oscars and Baftas have been delayed for a few months due to Covid-, so this could be a good time for the film industry to have a rethink about the whole business of award shows.Instead of a seemingly never-ending run of ceremonies, perhaps there should be a cull. In the US they could keep the Oscars for films, the Emmys for TV and the Tonys for theatre, and here the Baftas, NTAs and Oliviers.Then each event would be special, rather than a seemingly endless parade of bored-looking stars like Renee Zellweger, above, done up to the nines and wishing they were at home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No matter that I am not, nor have ever been, a member of the Conservative Party.I would never be forgiven by some people, who just couldn’t understand why an ethnic minority person would have sympathy for Conservative policies. At best we’ve been hoodwinked at worst we must just be plain evil.It often feels like we are not allowed to think for ourselves, outside of the orthodoxies set down by left-wing political groupthink.In the days of fighting to set up my school, and in our first few years of establishing ourselves, I received racist emails and threats of violence — from the Left.There were protests outside my school and abuse was shouted in my face from militant union members opposed to free schools.My detractors tried hard to discredit me in ways that made sense to them.There was even a running Wikipedia battle over my heritage, lasting for years.It was regularly edited to state that I was of Indian descent, while some people claimed my ancestry to be Indian Ugandan, and thereforethat I must hate black people.It was absurd, and I didn’t know from one day to the next what race my Wikipedia page would say I was.While it seems a bizarre thing to fight over, some opponents clearly believed that my criticisms of the education system and my support for free schools could be discountedI wasn’t black.My experience ten years ago is why today I have the greatest sympathy for Conservative MPs such as Priti Patel and Kemi Badenoch. Heaven knows what actual Tory MPs from ethnic minorities must have to endure.Mirza has been working with the Conservative Party for many years and her simple appointment to this role has enraged her detractors. For them, a “good” ethnic minority is one who always toes the leftist line.So play around with my Wikipedia page, make me Indian with a couple of keyboard strokes, and suddenly not only have they wiped my mother out of existence, but my words don’t really matter any more. This accusation of “not being black enough” raised its ugly head when Priti Patel was accused of distracting from the racism facing black people by highlighting her own experiences — assomehow her struggles were worth less because she is of Indian heritage .That being called a “P**i” as a young girl wouldn’t have had the same crushing, hurtful impact as any other racial slur. Similarly, Munira Mirza has been accused of not being able to understand the experiences of black people because she is of Pakistani origin.The recent protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement should have provoked serious conversations about the meaning and impact of race we all need to explore the nature of racism and what to do about it.But it is clear to me, from the black boxes on Instagram to the meaningless supportive BLM statements on corporate websites, that few people are interested in examining race in our own society.Most people want an easy fix, a stamp of approval that will allow them to be branded a non-racist so that they can go back to their normal lives, satisfied that they are a good person .This is not even remotely helpful to anyone, it’s simple box ticking but the desire to signal “anti-racism” instead of just not being a racist is so prevalent that at times I wonder whether human beings have the capacity to distinguish between the two: The signal and the reality.This tick-box race culture goes hand in hand with the oppression Olympics. Hierarchies of race are the easy bingo card that allows ethnic people to be ticked off on a sheet.Chinese  Sorry, only two oppression points for you. Black  Wow, that’s ten points! You go straight to the top!This is why,you are merely interested in appearing to be non-racist, rather than actually being a non-racist, you will buy into the idea of this totem pole of oppression.You will ignore that race and class are so much more complex than this.My father was of Indian heritage, but he came from a much poorer environment than my black mother and grew up without any shoes.Le is more complicated than the tick-box culture allows, butyour only interest in race is to do enough to signal to everyone that you aren’t a racist, then you will promote that hierarchy enthusiastically, because it is the perfect prop for your non-racist dissimulation. It doesn’t require any thought or effort.The reality of being anti-racist requires years of reading and discussion, befriending a iety of black people, including ones who think dferently from you politicallyand really coming to terms with one’s own uncomfortable feelings around race. Signalling requires a black box on Instagram and instantly everyone approves of you. You can see why most people choose the simpler option.In fact, spending a letime helping black boys realise their potential, something Black Lives Matter should approve of, instead of earning me adoration as a black box on Instagram does, has given me many enemies.My -plus years of improving young people’s lives is meaningless next to the superficial letters of support for BLM, because making a useful dference to people’s lives is less important than being seen to do so. It is a wonder why anyone ever does anything truly good at all.But there is one way of being anti-racist in a very simple and real way that takes no time at all.Allow Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and Munira Mirza the right that so many white people enjoy and take for granted: The right to think for themselves.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mums.And when you are responsible for home-educating your children as well as working out how to feed them three meals a day while holding down your job and everything  you used to do before children went to school at home, there is a strong incentive to get those schools open. And quick.Perhaps less so when someone  is taking care of all that stuff for you.Getting our classrooms back up and running may well take a bit of lateral thought, because of course it has to be safe to do so. But on the basis we can now pop to Zara or Ikea, surely we can open our schools safely Few disagree that lockdown should have included schools, but they need to open as soon as it is safe to do so.Yes, these things all need proper managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help them with the logistics and arrangements To socially distance safely, we may need to cut class sizes in half and have twice as many classrooms, so why not look to use dferent spaces, for example empty community halls, empty libraries, empty offices etc.What about outdoor learning in small groups If we cut classrooms by half we will need twice as many teachers.So how about encouraging unemployed graduates to work as teaching assistants Or asking retired teachers to come out of retirement, just as many nurses did at the beginning of the pandemic.You know you can find the solution when it’s your problem to solve. Which is why any government and any Cabinet should be as representational of “real le” as possible, which is why we need more women advising the Prime Minister.That said, no doubt many women just don’t fancy a le in politics. When you look at the abuse, death treats, and sexism they face, who can blame them.But unless there are people from all walks of le — including women — in the Cabinet, then the issues that affect real people will not be properly tackled or solved.Just look at the incredible effect that some of the world’s female leaders have had when they’ve acted swtly and decisively in the face of Covid-.Germany’s Angela Merkel has kept deaths in her country down to just  per million — compared to  per million in the UK.New Zealand’s inspiring Jacinda Ardern has overseen a remarkable response to the pandemic which involved a rapid, draconian lockdown.Only  people died there. She has been widely praised for her strength in leadership.These daily UK Government press briefings have made it all too clear that we are crying out for more women at the helm.The steady stream of menfielding questions on the topics of the day has been alarming. Priti Patel’s appearances could be counted on one hand.It does make you wonder whether we’d be in a healthier positionmore women had been given more prominence in Boris’s Cabinet.I think we would be.Until recently, many people knew Maya Jama as the girlfriend of rapper Stormzy, but they broke up as a couple last year.What people are now gradually realising is that she has had a fantastic career in her own right – and she proved it last week when she stole the show while co-presenting Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer on BBC.And it wasn’t because her low-cut top, inset, raised a few eyebrows, though certainly not mine.As she rightly pointed out, she can dress how she pleases.She stole the show because she is good at what she does and is engaging.At the age of  she has already done a stint on MTV, DJing on Rinse FM, a job on Radio , and now she is presenting Saturday night TV.Andit weren’t for Covid- she would be acting in her first film around about now too.Plus, as a sideline she is launching a skincare range and has a mysterious big project brewing – rumoured by some to be Strictly Come Dancing.In fact, she said in an interview this week that lockdown is the first time since she was  that she has had such an extended rest .All of this would be impressive for any -year-old but way more so when you know that Maya’s father was in and out of prison for much of her childhood. And not only that – in  when she was , her then boyfriend, Rico Gordon, was killed in a shooting.These are the kind of le experiences that can lead young people down a very dferent track to the one that Maya has put herself on, and for that alone she deserves our admiration.But really we should admire her solely because she is so good at what she does, and such a brave and eloquent voice for her generation.Kate Ferdinand has announced she is pregnant and expecting her first child with husband of nine months Rio.It really could not happen to a nicer or more deserving couple, as evidenced by the fact that when they told Rio’s three children – Lorenz, , Tate, , and nine-year-old Tia – the youngsters jumped up and down with joy.That is the reaction of children who have been made to feel happy, secure and, above all, loved by their father and his new we, despite having gone through the pain of losing their mother.Kate put the video on Instagram with the caption: “The crazy house is about to get a little bit crazier . . . every time I watch this it makes me cry, the best reaction. Baby Ferdy, we are all so excited to meet you.”Good luck to them.About bloody time.This is an opportunity to be seized.If we think carefully about how to spend the money in the right way, we can achieve a great deal of good in this country – and God knows we need that right now.I am sure I’m not the only one having mixed feelings about shops reopening and the huge step back towards “normality” that we all took this week.On the one hand it feels like a huge relief.Thank goodness things are moving again.On the other, I’m a bit worried about how to get out of my pyjamas, start wearing make-up and navigate my working wardrobe again.On balance, though, I’m excited for us to all start doing what we can to get the economy growing again.Talking of shops reopening, I didn’t enjoy the level of scorn being heaped by people on social media on to the huge queues outside Primark stores, which re-opened on Monday.I think before they are so judgmental they should stop for a minute and consider that many people do not have credit cards so cannot shop online.But not only that – say what you like about Primark clothes, one thing they are is cheap.Families with kids who have grown out of their gear over lockdown couldn’t wait to get in there to grab what they needed, and there was a distinctly snobbish element to some people’s judgment.They should think before they speak.Photos of Reese Witherspoon running in a baseball cap with her face concealed by a mask made me realise celebs everywhere – especially those with lockdown hair and faces that might need a bit of  TLC – are seeing this season’s new must-have accessory as an opportunity to conceal a multitude of sins.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They do what they are told to by top brass but these horribly mixed messages are not a good look.It was once commonplace to hear that this country has the best police force in the world. When was the last time you heard that But it was true. Think of the late PC Keith Palmer, who died in  while heroically preventing a kne-wielding Islamist terrorist from entering the Palace of ­Westminster.Yet during this lockdown, there has been a steady draining away of respect for the police.How we all chortled to learn that in Hampshire,  per cent of police are now overweight or obese — the fat-buttocked blue line.While in London, when a ­protester leapt in front of the PM’s car causing a minor crash, it was hardly a complete surprise to see day-dreaming officers gormlessly staring off into space, as oblivious as Keystone Cops in a coma.There is a growing lack of respect for the police and that is the reason why  officers were injured in one weekend.The ordinary copper has been poorly led, leading to inevitable inaction the moment they are met by protesters or a crowd of eager shoppers at Nike Town.Their own senior officers seem far more concerned about ­displaying their politically correct credentials rather than anything resembling law and order. More than  years ago, the Macpherson Report into the death of Stephen Lawrence in South East London found the Met Police to be ­“institutionally racist”.There has been a great overhaul in the force since.It is hugely welcome that there are Black Asian and Minority ­Ethnicofficers now in senior Scotland Yard roles. This was long overdue.But there is still a long way to go before the force can be regarded as being truly erse.Five of the nation’s police forces have only one black officer.Forces in Durham, North ­Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales had only one black officer in their ranks each as of March last year.This doesn’t mean our officers should be drawn into events like the death of George Floyd , miles away.It should be self-evident that British police were not in any way responsible for that death in Minneapolis.And yet a statement issued on behalf of Britain’s Chief Constables solemnly stated: “We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and ­horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.“Justice and accountability should follow. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it.”But the appalling racist violence of American cops — or indeed, when the police go on a violent rampage in Paris or Hong Kong — should not be clumsily confused with the issues our bobbies face here.As the violent clashes of the past few weeks have demonstrated, our officers should be focused on our own problems dealing with crime on our own streets.PAMELA ANDERSON ­promotes fake leather vegan handbags.You would never guess it’s mostly plastic.The bag, I mean.

One law for them etc.Meanwhile, the Government is finally showing some urgency about getting the schools open again for all, pumping £billion into state schools over the next year, including £million for the most disadvantaged children.It beggars belief that non-essential shops have reopened while schools remain closed or see only a trickle of pupils.There are no non-essential children.DOMINIC RAAB says he would only take the knee for his missus and the Queen.Cue widespread and totally predictable outrage from the likes of Labour’s permanently apoplectic David Lammy.But as Raab’s Jewish father Peter fled the Nazis as a six-year-old Czech in , I don’t think the Foreign Secretary needs lessons in opposing racism from anyone.And to many of us, “taking the knee” looks like a servile and empty gesture, bowing down before the great gods of woke.During World War Two, there were those who thought Dame Veras songs were too sentimental for fighting men who might never see home again.But with We’ll Meet Again and The White Clfs Of Dover, Vera gave hope in the darkness all around.It is signicant that the Queen chose that immortal phase “We will meet again” in her address to the nation at the height of the pandemic.Some songs last for ever.DAN WALKER, the BBC presenter, mocks a supporter of the online campaign Defund The BBC as “a Russian bot” – meaning a fake account run by foreign communists who seek our demise.Oh, Dan!

He was left with ious cuts to his head including a partially severed earlobe.The victim received four stitches in his ear at the hospital while Ellis made full admissions in the police interview.She said she was ashamed of what she had done, Mr Muller told the court.Ellis had no previous convictions before the assault and had shown remorse, the court was told.Jason Patel, defending, asked his client to be given full credit for her early guilty plea.He said the CCTV footage showed it was not one way, describing her as mortied by her actions.James Burbidge QC, the Recorder of Worcester, said that Ellis claimed Mr Marshman was a coercive and controlling inidual but added: This is not a court of moral judgement.He discounted  per cent from theof the custodial element of her sentence to reflect her early guilty plea.Mr Marshman had also entered a retraction statement on March .Judge Burbidge said that Mr Marshman was not the only victim - its not a crime that only affects him and that the case could not be decided by the parties involved.He added: In his statement, he sounds indignant.The judge read out part of a letter from Mr Marshman, who said police and the Crown Prosecution Service had not taken the time or effort to see or consider a bigger picture, He branded their actions despicable before going on to say he intends to make a complaint.However, the judge also read out Mr Marshmans original witness statement in which the victim said: There was no reason for Sophie to glass me.Im in full support of police action for this relationship is now over. I do not wish for Sophie to contact me any longer. I always thought she had a psycho streak.Mr Marshman, who said he had drunk  pints of beer, initially described what happened to him as completely uncalled for.Judge Burbidge sentenced Ellis to  months in prison suspended for one year and ordered her to complete  hours of unpaid work.He told her she must organise childcare to allow her to complete it but would not be able to do the unpaid work immediately due to the coronavirus pandemic.The judge also ordered her to complete  rehabilitation activity requirement days.The defendant could be seen crying and dabbing her eyes with a tissue before she walked free from court.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Families have lost loved ones. Our most vulnerable have been isolated for  weeks. Some have lost livelihoods. For NHS and care staff, the level of death, and the heart-breaking ­conversations that go along with it, have been on a magnitude never seen. Breaking the worst news imaginable to a loved one over the phone, simply makes the trauma worse. This virus has taken the humanity out of grieving. The country has looked for ­leadership throughout this crisis. While other countries were flattening the curve after taking crucial measures, the death rate in the UK continued to rise. The Government was too slow to get much needed protective equipment to frontline NHS and care staff. It was too slow to implement lockdown. And it was too slow to roll out mass testing. As the crisis starts to ease, we must be prepared for a surge in demand for other services. People have not had routine access to GPs. Many ­non-urgent hospital procedures have been ­postponed. As our country gradually reopens to the new normal, demand for these services will increase and it will require detailed planning.  People’s mental health and well-being are more important than ever. With record job losses and an all-time high in applications for universal credit, financial worries are greater. Families have lost loved ones without holding their hands in their final days and hours. It is simply heart-breaking how many people have not been able to say goodbye.  There has been hope in this crisis, however. Our communities have come together to ensure that our most ­vulnerable are not left alone. Food and supplies have been donated to make sure our frontline NHS staff have everything they need. Heroes such as Captain Tom Moore, have raised millions for NHS charities and other fantastic causes.  Communities have stepped up – it is time that the Government does too. It needs to have a plan in place for what support the NHS needs, whether there’s a second wave or not. Our mental health services need to be ready for the surge in demand. The Government has had months to make plans but we’ve heard nothing. Boris Johnson may try to distract people by grand promises, but until they are delivered we must not stop asking. We must not stop making noise.

The £.-a-year leline was due to be means-tested from June , but BBC bosses delayed curbs for two months until August  because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Mirror is campaigning to permanently save the benefit, with more than , readers backing the fight by completing coupons in the paper. Age UK Charity Director Caroline Abrahams said: “It’s very hard to see how the BBC could go ahead with their replacement for the over- free TV licence in August, as they currently plan. “Delaying the replacement scheme to October would be a sensible decision by the BBC in light of the pandemic – a terrible time for many older people during which, for many, their TV has never been more of a leline. “Of course, Age UK is convinced that free TV licences should stay in place permanently and we hope that the searing experience of the pandemic will persuade the BBC and the Government to look at the issue afresh and agree to keep them. “It would be a very popular decision.” Silver Voices director Dennis Reed said: It is no surprise to us that there is strong speculation that there may be a further delay in the scrapping of free licences for the over s. “Talks started on Friday between Silver Voices and the BBC to explore ways of settling this dispute once and for all, and the talks will continue next week.  “However, we will not be content with yet another short delay, without any indication that the Government and BBC are serious about dropping this cruel policy. “We cannot go on with the threat of the licence fee hanging over the heads of older people indefinitely. “The Government must be reminded of the impact of this policy on the lives of millions of older people.” Labour peer Lord George Foulkes, chairman of Parliamentaposs cross-party group for Ageing and Older People, said: “The current uncertainty is detrimental to many older people and proposals to withdraw free TV licences need to be scrapped permanently. “With that, the Government should cover the cost as a social benefit and not burden the BBC, which is already strapped for cash.” One expert believed the incoming director-general, Tim Davie, could save free licences permanently.

With the public mood turning away from lockdown, pubs were preparing to open early in July whatever No’s advice. The Covid- alert has gone from four to three, meaning transmission is no longer “high” but it is in “general circulation”. The World Health Organisation recommends at least m distancing and France, China, Denmark, and Singapore, Canada and Spain are also reviewing their m rule. Here, we look at the impact of a m rule. Pubs - easier to get a pint Britons have jumped the gun on lockdown easing and are enjoying drinks in beer gardens and outdoor seat areas. These young drinkers were pictured yesterday in King’s Cross in London. Pubs are desperate for rules to be relaxed to save many of the . million hospitality jobs under threat. Landlords have warned that m distancing between customers will make trading “unsustainable”. Easing the rule will mean more clientele, saving some of the , pubs under threat of never reopening. Table service, strict cleaning rotas and floor markings will be the norm. Beer gardens in the first pubs to open will be patrolled to enforce new rules from July . Restaurants - get more diners in  Bosses have pleaded for an end to the m rule so that they can get enough diners in to make some money. Cutlery will be brought out with food, menus will be disposable and waiters must wash their hands between every serving – or wear gloves. Plastic screens may be used and diner arrival times will be staggered. Schools - ready for full classes  A cut to m means schools can open with full classes of around  when the academic year starts in September. Boris Johnson said he was “sure” relaxing the distancing rule, with other health safeguards, would allow all schools to reopen that month. Classes will increase from  to normal as the size of teaching “bubbles” double. A change would also enable pupils to take up more quickly the benefits of the Government’s £ billion catch up on learning fund.couldn’t meet the m rule. Hand sanitiser will be used at the door. Nightclub openings could be put back as dancefloors pose a risk. Shops - increase the footfall  Relaxing the rule will be a leline for larger shops and chains, allowing up to double the footfall. Smaller shops will find it harder, but the change will give many outlets a better chance of survival as stores struggle to recoup losses of £.million a week in lockdown. Hairdressers are expected to reopen from July , with advice to avoid face-to-face chat and talk only about essentials, facing the mirror. Around , people work in hairdressing and beauty. Sports - fans in the stadium  Fans will benefit from a m distancing, with the possibility of limited access to fixtures such as big football games. Some sports, such as cricket, not cleared under the m rule, will resume as players can play closer to each other. Golfers - who were allowed back last month - may also have more rules relaxed.

Like a dedicated athlete, it strives every week to break new records. A month ago it was planning to increase the surcharge foreign nurses pay to use the NHS, just as the whole country was banging saucepans for nurses, and a foreign nurse saved the le of the Prime Minister. Surely, we thought, this is the most idiotic extraordinarily dingbat psycho policy any government has thought of. But they’d hardly started. This week the Tories insisted there was no problem with the poorest kids going hungry over the summer, until forced to change their mind because of a campaign started by Marcus Rashford. If Dame Vera Lynn hadn’t died, next week they’d have announced they were cutting off her old-age pension until a petition started by Harry Kane attracted  million signatures and they had to back down. Then they’d reveal a scheme that all single mothers’ breast milk should be confiscated by officials from the Department of Works and Pensions, and sold to China as part of a post-Brexit trade deal. Finally they’d announce another U-turn after Sam Allardyce launched his opposition during post-match comments after the game between Southampton and Burnley. To start with, they tried to defend not feeding children over the summer. Because hungry schoolkids are obviously the people who should pay for the virus-led economic slump.  After all, they’re the people with all the spare money. I’m sick of hungry schoolkids who are so rich they keep their school dinner in an offshore account in the Cayman Islands. There are even specialist accountants, who advise their clients that “ you deposit a shepherd’s pie and two bowls of rhubarb and custard into our scheme in Jersey, it will be worth a wheelbarrow full of spaghetti bolognese by the end of the tax year”. Then they backed down, and praised Marcus Rashford for pointing out thatyou don’t provide dinners for people who haven’t got a dinner, they won’t have a dinner.  This must have been the problem all through the years of austerity. The Government would cut social services and libraries, but they couldn’t know this would result in social services and libraries being cut. If only a -year-old Marcus Rashford had written a letter explaining this, it might have been sorted out. But no, he was too busy practising how to beat a goalkeeper at the near post. It’s just “me, me, me” with some people.

The scheme would end the wait for a monthly wage and ease cashflow problems hitting millons during the Covid- pandemic. The proposal by ex-Labour Treasury minister Phil Woolas would mean you could use an employer’s payroll like a current bank account – instant access to your money but without any overdraft facility. Financial Secretary Jesse Norman now has the scheme in his in-tray. The Bank of England is interested in it and it’s backed by payroll providers covering . million employees. It will also be considered by the powerful Commons Treasury Select Committee looking for ways to help cash-strapped workers. Most companies pay monthly as it is more convenient to administer. But payroll advance technology means more frequent payments would cost just £ a month, most likely charged to the employee. Mr Woolas said: “Workers would rather have their money sooner, especially those struggling. The reality is most would opt to be paid weekly.  It could make the dference between keeping their heads above water and le on benefits.” Most common reasons for workers needing instant cash are unexpected household and car repairs or travel to help sick relatives. The scheme would end the need to turn to unscrupulous payday lenders. Half of UK workers do not have access to more than £ in cash.  Mr Woolas added: “This would put the legalised loan sharks out of business.” Mr Woolas has hooked up with financing techniques entrepreneur David Brown as part of a wider job protection scheme known as Toupay – an alternative to Mr Sunak’s taxpayer funded furlough safety net.

They don’t go into the job for money or easy hours – they work long days saving lives and when they lose a patient, it’s upsetting. Paediatric nurse Genene Jones would often have an extreme reaction when a child on her ward died.Once, Jones even pulled up a stool in the cubicle where a young infant had passed away, just so she could stare at the body, seemingly processing the tragedy. No one liked to lose a patient, but for Jones it was a regular occurrence as she chose to work with the very sickest of children.After marrying her childhood sweetheart and trying her hand at being a beautician, Jones changed tack and trained to be a nurse. She ended up being a licensed vocational nursein the s at the former Bexar County Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, now the University Hospital of San Antonio. It was tough working in the intensive care unit, surrounded by so many poorly children, but Jones, then , took it in her stride, with her brisk and matter-of-fact demeanour. She had two children of her own, but they were mainly cared for by her adoptive mum. Jones was focused on her patients. But while many showered Jones with praise, staff did notice that babies and young children were dying at an alarming rate at the hospital. There was a high level of cardiac arrests and uncontrollable bleeding – symptoms unrelated to the diagnosis of the patients. When the numbers got into double figures, there was a  put together to launch an internal inquiry.It was discovered that around  babies had died from cardiac arrest or bleeding, during the period of May to December . It was clear something was very wrong. All the staff were interviewed and one of Jones’s colleagues even blatantly accused her of having a part in the deaths of the children. It was a shocking accusation, against a well-regarded nurse, but no one could prove anything.So, in the end, the hospital decided not to staff the intensive care unit with LVNs any more, Jones left and the matter was swept away. It should have been investigated further. Was there more to the accusation against Jones than first thought  Had the hospital been at fault and Jones had taken the fall  Whatever was believed at the time, it certainly didn’t stop her getting another job.  Jones went on to secure a position working with a Dr Kathleen Holland at her small Kerrville paediatric clinic in Texas. Shortly after starting, a number of children began experiencing breathing problems and had to be rushed to a nearby hospital. It was strange for children to fall ill while visiting the clinic. Then -month-old Cha McClellan was given what should have been a routine immunisation for mumps and measles. Jones administered the injection and, almost immediately, Cha had a seizure. Little Cha was rushed to hospital in San Antonio but on the way, she suffered a cardiac arrest and died. The abnormal cases were starting to attract attention. Dr Holland became suspicious and tests revealed a powerful muscle relaxant called succinylcholine in Cha’s body.Dr Holland found a bottle of it in her clinic with needle puncture marks in the lid as though some had been used – despite no record of it being needed or authorised. It turned out the bottle was partly filled with saline in an attempt to cover up that some of the succinylcholine had been used. Only Dr Holland and Jones had access to the drug and she informed the authorities and dismissed the nurse.  By now, the investigation had gathered pace. Jones had been linked to a number of other deaths – up to , including at the hospital where she’d worked previously. It was a chilling discovery and seemed unthinkable. Would a devoted nurse really be killing babies  Meanwhile, Jones’s first marriage had failed and she was married to a -year-old nursing assistant. He filed for orce shortly after Jones was charged with the murder of Cha and poisoning of a second child. Investigators had connected Jones to countless deaths and they weren’t even sure how to start piecing it all together.The evidence suggested she had been injecting babies and infants with a deadly dose of drugs to trigger heart failure and haemorrhaging – some patients she managed to save, while others died. But why  By the trial in  for Cha’s murder the media were obsessed with the killer nurse – the ‘Angel Of Death’.Prosecutors speculated that Jones, then , had injected children with drugs to demonstrate the need for a paediatric intensive care unit at the nearby hospital. Other prosecutors said Jones was taking her victims to the brink of death so that she could take action and save them – looking like a heroic miracle worker. She was found guilty and sentenced to  years. Later that year, Jones went to trial again for the poisoning of four-week-old Rolando Santos in January . Lawyers said she had injected Rolando with the blood-thinning drug Heparin. Thankfully this time, her victim survived. Again, Jones was found guilty and sentenced to  years in prison.  Once Jones was found guilty, Bexar County Hospital feared further litigation attempts and destroyed countless records that may have connected her to more deaths. To avoid costly payments and further embarrassment, the true number of her unfortunate victims will never be known. Even with the sentence given to Jones, the families still didn’t have closure. Because of a law in place at the time of her conviction that was designed to deal with prison overcrowding, she was facing only serving one third of her sentence and would get automatic parole in . Over the years she has been denied early parole on multiple occasions. But the loophole meant that the day would come when Jones would walk free. Jones would go on to inspire films, TV movies and crime programmes.She was even rumoured to be the inspiration for the character of Annie Wilkes from Stephen King’s Misery.

The home in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is packed with newspapers dating back to , stopped clocks, a half-smoked pipe, and the owneraposs shoes left by the bed years after the property was vacated. Photographer Rebecca was invited in to see the decaying cottage after its owner died and she was left in awe of the haunting scenes within the perfectly preserved home. The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.  She said: I have to admit I saw the outside and wasnapost sureit was worth it. As soon as I opened the door I was blown away. I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove. He was a hearty farmer, milking cows to produce milk and butter.It was reportedyou stayed for dinner in the house and you finished up, you were given another dinner for seconds.No one left with an empty stomach. One of the mysteries Rebecca was able to solve was personal items belonging to an Edwin McQueen, who she was able to discover was married to Dessieaposs mum. He worked as a policeman, and a certicate from  and a framed picture of him in his unorm was found in one of the bedrooms.

Three people were killed when a man armed with a kne started stabbing people aposrandomlyapos at Forbury Park in the city. The incident was initially reported as being treated as a potential terror attack by security services, but police have since said it is not being treated as a terrorism incident, with a -year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder. A source told the Sunday Mirror: “A man pulled a kne and started attacking people at random in Reading, near the Crown Court. “It is thought there was one attacker who has surrendered to police.  It appears the attack was stopped when a lone sergeant, who responded when the alarm was raised, ran to the scene, saw the attacker running away with a kne and rugby tackled him to the ground.” Personal trainer Lawrence Wort, , who said he was around  metres from the attack, told PA: The park was pretty full, a lot of people sat around drinking with friends, when one lone person walked through, suddenly shouted some unintelligible words and went around a large group of around , trying to stab them. He stabbed three of them, severely in the neck, and under the arms, and then turned and started running towards me, and we turned and started running.When he realised that he couldnapost catch us, he tried to stab another group sat down, he got one person in the back of the neck and then when he realised everyone was starting to run, he ran out the park. Another witness, Dan, , said he saw a man running around a circle of people apostappingapos them and at first thought they were playing a game - before he saw blood. Dan, a local, described how he and his friends had chosen a spot to sit and enjoy the sunshine at the park in Reading, Berkshire when he noticed the commotion. He said he saw a man approach a group sitting in the sun about  metres away.They were just in a circle chatting. Dan saw the man drew his attention because he appeared to be racing around the group tapping them on the head. He pointed them out to his friends. He told the : I thought they were playing duck duck goose and thought someone had been sick, we realised it was blood spraying out.  To their horror Dan and his friends suddenly realised the group were being attacked. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: My thoughts are with all of those affected by the appalling incident in Reading and my thanks to the emergency services on the scene. Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted that she was deeply concerned and it is understood she is being kept updated on the situation. A Thames Valley Police statement said:A number of people sustained injuries and were taken to hospital.

Boris Johnson is expected to restart domestic tourism on July , according to the Mail on Sunday, in a bid to boost the ailing economy.Although No  says a final decision has not been made, it is understood officials are preparing to announce hotels and bed and breakfasts will open alongside pubs, restaurants, and hairdressers at the beginning of next month. However, campsites are likely to have to wait longer due to fears shared facilities could allow coronavirus to spread. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here According to the paper, the tourism industry will be issued with new guidance on how to welcome guests back safely by the end of next week.It comes amid widespread expectation that Mr Johnson will announce that the two-metre rule will be cut to one next week, after the UKaposs coronavirus alert level was reduced for the first time since the start of the pandemic.The measure will pave the way for the PM to signicantly relax lockdown measures and restart the economy over the coming fortnight. It is understood that scientists have given their approval to reduce the distance people need to stay apart to one metre, provided other precautions are taken. MPs and tourism bosses have been calling for clarity over when bookings can be accepted again, and how the hospitality sector will operate post-lockdown. Former Environment Minister Owen Paterson told the Mail: To have any hope of saving this summer season for our tourist industry, the Government must announce this week what the arrangements will be for reopening on July . Ministers canapost leave our holiday parks, hotels and pubs in the dark any longer.  Meanwhile Patricia Yates, the chief executive of Visit Britain, said: We need to know what the plan is. The lack of Government guidelines and that uncertainty around the date is causing a great deal of consternation within the industry. The body estimates that the tourism sector, which accounts for three million jobs, will be hit with losses of up to £ billion this year because of coronavirus.

He claimed that the convicted paedophile mocked German police and boasted they had no evidence after they first called him in for questioning in . The man, once close to Brueckner, said he waved a legal letter over the case in front of him ashe was proud of it. “He laughed about it and said it was a summons. He was just waving this piece of paper about. I felt like it was like a little trophy to him,” said the ex-pal. “After a couple of weeks we started winding him up about it saying ‘Maddie’s downstairs in the cellar. Come on Christian get Maddie out of the cellar’. “He’d smirk and laugh and then say ‘leave me alone, leave me alone’.” At that time, Brueckner, , had two homes in Braunschweig, near Hanover – a kiosk he ran which had living quarters and a “shed with a bed” attached to an allotment. That property had a makesht cellar. Madeleine vanished from her family’s holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May , days before her fourth birthday. Brueckner lived near the resort at that time, on and off, and had a grey Jaguar and a Westfalia camper van which were seen in the area. The man, who we have agreed not to name, added: “Christian said ‘just because I was in Portugal  years, they send me this. “‘Just because I was living there at the time and also in that time frame I was close by. Just because I was living out of a van’. “He kept going on about it and waving the paper around saying, ‘I have nothing to do with this, they are trying to get me’.  “It was like he had rehearsed what he was saying.” The friend added: “He said that he went to answer the summons and he told police that he had nothing to do with it. “I asked him ‘but why say that as you’re only a witness ’ He just said ‘let’s have a party!’. “He told me, ‘they asked me a load of questions and I answered them’. Then he said, ‘they’ve got nothing on me. They can’t get me’.”  German police have been blasted since it emerged they tipped off Brueckner that he was being looked at in relation to the case and asked himhe could attend an interview – giving him the chance to dispose of any potential evidence.

His old pal said: “It feels now like the police didn’t take it seriously enough at the time. The cops in Braunschweig have messed up badly. Now I feel sick to my stomach when I think about him.” The man told us he knew a former teenage girlfriend of Brueckner, adding: “She was like a slave.”  He told how Brueckner once talked to him about a bizarre plan he had for the ‘cellar’ at his allotment home.

Serafim Vieira, who represented the suspect in a separate criminal case, believes the German paedophile has psychopathic traits. AskedBruckner, , could have snatched the British youngster, he ­replied: “I believe he may be behind the disappearance of Madeleine.” Mr Vieira acted for Brueckner in  after he was arrested for stealing diesel from HGVs in Portugal’s Algarve. During the court hearing the German admitted his secret paedophile past. This was a year before three-year-old Madeleine disappeared. Brueckner told a judge he served  months in prison for a sex attack on a youngster in his homeland when he was a teenager. The revelation that authorities knew of his conviction has piled further pressure on Portuguese officials. A police source previously said the reason Brueckner was never quizzed about Madeleine was because they did not know he was a sex offender. But official documents show he ­publicly revealed his past ­crimes in court a year ­before Madeleine vanished from her parents’ holiday flat in Praia da Luz in May . Mr Vieira told Portugal’s RTP TV ­channel he thinks Bruckner might be ­responsible for her ­disappearance. Askedhis former client had a ­psychopathic temperament, he said of Brueckner: “I can’t say he didn’t. On the contrary.”  And about claims Brueckner was ­involved in Madeleine’s disappearance, he said: “I’m not surprised.” Bruckner was caught stealing fuel from HGVs in Portimao with an Austrian drter, Michael Tatschl, in April . At their first court ­appearance in the Algarve town, the then -year-old German came clean about his past. He told Judge Antonieta Nascimento he was  when he was ­convicted of thefts and sexual offences in his home country. Mr Vieira said the German was held on ­remand for eight months because he refused to give his address in court. He was living in a rented ramshackle farmhouse in the hills outside Praia da Luz at the time of his arrest. But in court he claimed to live in a camper van at a German-owned scrap yard in the hamlet of Barrocal. Authorities in Germany stunned the world a fortnight ago by announcing the Brueckner probe  years after Madeleine vanished while on holiday with parents Kate and Gerry, from Rothley, Leics. Police are also probingBrueckner is linked to the cases of five children going back to  in Germany, Belgium and Portugal. Two were found murdered and three are still missing.

An inside source has spoken out about fears the future king could be painted as an unsympathetic, unfeeling character who failed to support the Sussexes when they decided to break away from the Royal Family. The source told the Sun that aides had been discussing among themselves that the book could likely only show Harry and Meghanaposs side of the rt. This is in spite of the book, titled aposFinding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Familyapos, not being an official biography. A source said aides have been discussing among themselves that the book will unfairly show only Harry and Meghan’s side of the rt, even though it is not an official ­biography.The source added: “They are worried William especially will be portrayed in a bad light. This sort of family spat shouldn’t be out there in public. This shouldn’t happen to future monarchs.  “The book could be the most damaging thing to the Royal Family since Prince Diana’s interview on Panorama with Martin Bashir. “The concern is it will somehow paint him as an unfeeling baddie against kind and philanthropic Harry and Meghan. The aides are ­privately worried about it. “Unsympathetic, unfeeling and unsupportive are the words being used but of course no one knows exactly what’s in it.”Dirty laundry aired this way could be as damaging as Princess Diana’s “there were three of us in this marriage” reference to Camilla in a bombshell  TV interview, the insider claimed. The Sussexes are reported to have co-operated with the book. Journalists Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand have had access to more than  people for the book and sources say it will portray the couple in a positive light.One fear is that it could be critical of William’s role during the Queen’s Megxit summit crisis talks at Sandringham in January — when he turned up last and didn’t stick around afterwards.The source added: “It’s about the way Harry and Meghan were trying to break with tradition.” "},{"url":null,"title":"relief brits hairdressers finally get","story":"NewsRelief for Brits as hairdressers finally get green light to reopen on July Boris Johnson is poised to announce that hairdressers will be among the businesses allowed to re-open on July , although staff will have to use PPE and keep chat to a minimumShareCommentsByAnna MacSwan:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video matt-hancock-uk-on-plan-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news relief-brits-hairdressers-finally-get-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Boris Johnson is due to announce that hair salons and barbers will be allowed to resume business in just under a fortnight, according to the Sun.Although Downing Street says a formal decision has not yet been taken, the PM is reportedly expected to allow hairdressers toto workthe two-metre rule is relaxed next week. It means that along with pubs, restaurants, and cafes, the nationaposs , hair stylists and beauticians will be able to re-open their doors in the first week of July. The news will come as a relief to millions of Brits who have either had to endure shaggy hair or take their chances with a DIY trim during the last  weeks of lockdown. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here It had previously been feared that professional hair cuts would have to be banned for at least six months due to the risk of coronavirus spreading. However, it is understood that the Government scientists have now agreed it is safe for salons to resume workadditional precautions are taken. All hairdressers and barbers will have to wear full-face plastic visors to prevent any infections from spreading.  Customers will also have to make an appointment before getting a cut, with a limit on numbers. Equipment will be disinfected more frequently, and staff have also been encouraged to cut down on small talk.  Under guidance issued by the National Hair and Beauty Federation, chat is to be kept to a minimum to avoid potentially infectious droplets spreading between stylists and their customers. Staff are also being told to hold discussions about styles and colouring should be made via the mirror, rather than face-to-face. A Whitehall source told the Sun: There’ll be a big rush to get an appointment when this is formally announced. It won’t be back to normal. But it’s an important step out of lockdown.

For missing from today’s fun is little Noah, who would have turned three this weekend. The adopted toddler died last November after a stomach infection led to complications. Ben was devastated. But with four other adopted children to focus on – each one with their own needs – he was determined to ensure happy memories of the boy they had lost. The children made a memory tree in disabled Noah’s honour – covered in rainbows and crystals. And there are photos of him in every room. Ben says: “The children sang a lullaby to Noah at his funeral. “My eldest always says good morning to him. And my daughter takes his teddy with her wherever she goes.” Ben also bought a card to mark what should have been Noah’s birthday. He adds: “It’s made me realise, you’ve got to make the most of every moment. And that’s what Noah did. “He may have been a little boy in a wheelchair but he had so much le about him. He taught people a lot.”  Single Ben is also dad to Jack, , Ruby, nine, Lilly, seven, and Joseph, four. And a new member of the family has arrived – a -month-old boy. Ben hopes to complete the adoption process soon. He goes on: “At one stage I thought there’s no way I can go through with this and adopt again. And there was an element of ‘am I trying to replace Noah ’ “But then I realised this little boy needs me, just as much as Noah needed me and the other children needed me. And the fact of the matter is, I could never replace him. “We’re hoping to have a picnic for Father’s Day. It’s going to be sad but I’m going to have pictures of Noah in the garden too, so he can be there with us. “I’m still Noah’s father, whether he’s here or not. I’m a father of six, but now I’m only caring for five.” Ben, from West Yorkshire, was  when he first applied to adopt. A couple of years later he welcomed Jack, who has autism and linked obsessive compulsive disorder. But under Ben’s care he has thrived.  Ben then went on to adopt blind Ruby, whose other conditions include spine curvature and limited use of her arms. He is also dad to Ruby’s half-sister Lilly, who is deaf, as well as Joseph, who has Down Syndrome. And the latest member of the family has “quite severe complex needs”, says Ben. Reflecting on Noah, he recalls the awful day the lad slipped away after falling ill. Noah had the rare condition Cornelia de Lange Syndrome. Sufferers have masses of hair. Noah also suffered deformities in his arms and had to be tube fed. Ben says: “I took him to the hospital the day before he died and they sent him home and said he had a viral infection. “The next day we got up, I put him in his chair and went to fetch his medication. When I came back he’d passed away. I tried to resuscitate him but there was nothing I could do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"summer solstice 2020 tiny group","story":"NewsSummer Solstice : Tiny group turn up at Stonehenge compared to over , last yearThe Summer Solstice, a celebration that marks the longest day of the year, is usually attended by more than , people but this year only a handful of people turned up due to Covid-ShareCommentsBySam Truelove:,  JUN NewsRollo Maughfling, Archdruid of Stonehenge and Britain, performing a ritual at Stonehenge \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Rollo Maughfling, Archdruid of Stonehenge and Britain, performed a ritual during a small ceremony near to the site.The sight of only a handful of people celebrating Summer Solstice is a strange one.

Kerry Postlethwaite was among parents shocked by our story about baby Alexander Parsons, who was killed by the rare condition PIMS-TS. Two days later her own son Joseph, eight, fell ill with matching symptoms . Mum-of-three Kerry, , of Anstey, Leics, said: “Joseph had Covid-like symptoms in March but they disappeared. A couple of days after reading about Alex, he developed the same cough and temperature out of the blue and said he also had a tummy ache. “I called  and they suggested we get him a test for Covid, but I couldn’t get Alex’s story out of my head. “Next day Joseph developed a sun-burn rash. He’d been in the paddling pool but was slathered in sunscreen. “That was the one thing that stood out for me. It was like a clock ticking. “I called  again and luckily they knew about the symptoms.” Joseph was taken to Leicester Infirmary where tests revealed one of his heart arteries was inflamed. Kerry added: “It was awful. Joseph said the pain in his heart made him crazy because it was hurting and asked mehe was going to die.  You are trying to fight back tears but you are mummy and you have to kiss it better evenyou don’t know things are going to be okay.” Joseph was given immunoglobulin – which helps destroy viruses – and released from hospital six days later. Kerry added: “I’ll be forever grateful to the family for finding the courage to share Alex’s story. It saved Joseph.” Alex was just eight months old. His mum Kathryn, , from Plymouth, said: “Losing Alex is awful but the fact our beautul boy could have saved other children’s lives is the one positive that can be taken from his death.  We’re so proud of him. “The fact people looked at Alex’s little face and took in the information that potentially saved their children is the best legacy we could ask for. A dozen or more families have been in touch with us to say they recognised their child had symptoms after reading about Alex. I’m so proud Alex has helped do this. He was amazing and had an impact on every single person he met.”  We can reveal  British children have ended up in intensive care with PIMS-TS since March. Just like Kawasaki disease, it inflames blood vessels as the body’s immune system goes into overdrive to fight Covid- infection.  The president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Professor Russell Viner, was so concerned by the emergence of the condition that he wrote to NHS England on the day Alex died. That alert helped doctors diagnose Leia Godwin, who spent four weeks in hospital after being hit by the disease.Six-month-old Leia, of Risca, South Wales, had a high temperature and rash while her identical twin Thea had no symptoms at all. Antibody tests showed Leia had coronavirus in the past.The twins could now hold the key to why Covid- affects some people more badly than others. Doctors at the Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital in Cardf have taken blood samples for genetic testing. Mum Hannah Godwin, , said: “Leia had a rash on her feet and I think the doctors initially thought it was septicaemia or meningitis. But then the alert about Alex was issued.“I believe his doctors were in touch with ours and we know we are lucky to have Leia home. It was such a scary time and she was so poorly. “Doctors don’t yet know why Leia got ill and Thea didn’t. We’ve given them permission to do whatever research they need to help other people.” As many as  British children have developed the condition. London’s Imperial College examined  and found a range of symptoms from a high temperature and abdominal pain to conjunctivitis and coronary inflammation. All the youngsters had a fever. Just over half had a rash.  Elizabeth Whittaker, a consultant in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial, said: “We know there have been fewer than  but more than  UK cases. “This isn’t going away. At the beginning there was a huge influx of cases. That settled down, but I think we will see a few new cases every week.” Her colleague Professor Michael Levin said more blood tests must be carried out on children suspected to have the condition. Alex is believed to be the first British child killed by PIMS-TS. His family is campaigning for greater awareness – backed by the parents of a five-year-old who nearly died.

The problem has spiralled during the ­lockdown and the Department of Work and Pensions is now refusing to take calls from desperate mums entitled to child maintenance payments. Some have even told us they are starving themselves to feed their children. Officials have let non-resident parents cut or stop their payments, without providing any evidence they are earning less. And shockingly, more than half of parents who receive child maintenance have been victims of domestic abuse. Since lockdown began, the number of calls made to single ­parent charity Gingerbread’s helpline have rocketed  per cent. After the DWP told parents it will take at least three months to probe their cases, one woman told how an adviser said she should contact her violent ex directly to ask for cash. She said: “I don’t eat dinners, I have an occasional piece of toast. I wear ­leggings with holes in so I can feed my kids. Payments stopped completely [after] lockdown.” Another victim, who is unable to work after her ex stalked her, said her payments stopped a month into the lockdown. She told how she cried when footballer Marcus Rashford forced the Government to provide free school meals over the summer, knowing they would be a leline. Labour MP Jess Phillips, shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, has written to the DWP to ask what methods are in place to assess the finances of those who claim they can’t pay. She has also asked what steps have been taken to protect domestic abuse victims. Ms Phillips said: “We have to stop abusers using financial incentives to carry on control. Where funds have been removed from families, at the very least the child maintenance service should have asked what that meant to them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what its like work prince","story":"NewsWhat its like to work with Prince William - from man who has known him  yearsEXCLUSIVE.

But in his role of chief executive officer at Centrepoint, Seyi Obakin OBE has spent a lot of time with Prince William, teaching him about the homeless charityaposs work and mission. The Duke of Cambridge is so committed to learning about the issue among young people that he spent a night sleeping on the streets with Seyi back in . He first visited one of their centres when he was child as his mum Princess Diana wanted him and Prince Harry to understand the issue, and has been passionate about their work ever since. He became patron in  - his first royal patronage when he was just , the same age many users are when they first receive support from the charity - and has spent the past  years learning, raising awareness and helping their cause in any way he way. Speaking to the Mirror, Seyi said: He was introduced to this problem early in his le. We were over the moon and delighted [when he wanted to be our patron]. The Princess of Wales, Diana, was our patron for many years, and then we had several years after she passed on when we didnapost have a patron at all. It was a great feeling for us that William wanted to carry on. I think it says something about an incredible testament to his motheraposs legacy that he wanted to be patron of Centrepoint and remain involved in finding a way through homelessness. He has a voice that most of us will never have, I think it is to his immense credit that heaposs happy to use that for the benefit of homeless people. I for one am grateful that he doe that. Speaking about the charity in  to mark its th anniversary, William recalled his visit with Diana as a child. He said: That example of selfless service that Centrepoint represents has stayed with me, and that is why it was the first charity that I wanted to be associated with. The extraordinary courage of so many of Centrepoint’s young people in rising to meet such seemingly insurmountable challenges in their lives. In order to do this, William carries out both private and public visits.  Public visits - the ones you read about in newspapers and see photos from on social media - are designed to raise awareness of the cause. However the private visits, which are done behind closed doors, are very dferent. Seyi said: We are working with some of the most vulnerable young people in the country. At public visits there are flashing lights and cameras, itaposs not the best time for young people to open up and thataposs what private visits can do. Those private visits are time when traumatised and vulnerable people are freer in his presence.  There are no cameras there, there are no journalists there. Theyaposre not worrying about whether what theyaposre saying might end up in the newspapers. He comes and he chats with young people, because thataposs when heaposs able to motivate and inspire on a one-to-one basis. He encourages young people to reach out to wherever their talents might take them. Prince William has an incredible gt, a talent, to put people at ease. I have seen young people chatting to him like old friends within minutes, I donapost think many people can do that.  The most powerful thing when he visits is that he can be so informal and easy to get on with. If you are a young person, often what happens is you donapost even know heaposs coming. You hear that Prince William is here. The first thing that happens, is you can get quite nervous - youaposll lost for words. But his own informality helps young people to break that down. He can have great conversations with young people that are really helpful to them. Itaposs an incredible thing, that heaposs able to do that.  Seyi shared one story that sticks in his mind about Williamaposs ability to make people feel at ease. I was at an event with him several years ago and he met this young person. She knew he was coming and she had completely clammed up and couldnapost get her words out. The prince bends down and whispered into the ears of this young person and it was like a flood gate. She started talking and couldnapost stop. Thataposs what itaposs like. In his role, William spends time learning about the issue of homelessness by meeting people who have been affected and those helping them. He is also an advocate for the issue, and Seyi says he also challenges us to do better, helping the charity to grow.  As part of his quest to understand more about homelessness, William spent a night sleeping on the streets with Seyi in . They decided to do it in December, which meant temperatures dropped as low as minus C. Speaking at the time, William said: I was very struck by the people I met and what they were struggling with – sleeping rough, sofa surfing, not having basic comforts a lot of us take for granted. That really struck me at a young age, bearing in mind the gulf for me, growing up in a palace, and seeing the other end of the spectrum where others were faced with huge personal challenges and were overcoming them. That was powerful to see at a young age. Seyi says William is also extremely passionate about their cause and wants to help in any way he can, and that he also remembers people he has spoken to them and checks in on their progress months later.  He said: He must meet thousands of people every year, and yet he has this incredible capacity to remember those heaposs met and ask after them several months later. Imagine youaposre a young person, and you find yourself cooking, eating and chatting with Prince William in private. Imagine what that does to motivate you. Knowing also, that in three months time, he might be asking how youaposre getting on. Itaposs hugely powerful and inspiring. Weaposve lucky to have him in our corner. Seyi says that William is also very approachable and jokes about with the users. He recalls a time when a young person stared at him, trying to work out why he recognised him.  They told him: You look like somebody famous. You look like Prince William, to which the Duke replied: Yeah, yeah, a lot of people have said that before and just carried on with his work. Like all charities, Centerpoint has had to adapt to the coronavirus lockdown, working in extremely dficult circumstances to ensure they can still help people. Theyaposve struggled with both fundraising and the logistics of services, trying to work out how to do what they do with social distancing and PPE.

The bug is becoming less deadly as it spreads, according to Professor Matteo Bassetti, head of an infectious diseases clinic at Italyaposs Policlinico San Martino hospital. He told the Sundaythat he has recently seen elderly patients recovering who would have died earlier on in the pandemic. Even patients aged  or  are now sitting up in bed and breathing without help. The same patients would have died in two or three days before, Professor Bassetti said. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here It was like an aggressive tiger in March and April but now it’s like a wild cat. The doctor says that at the height of Italyaposs Covid- pandemic in March and early April, patients frequently presented with an illness which was very dficult to manage. The sickest people often needed oxygen and ventilation, and some went on to develop pneumonia. However, he says that in the past four weeks the picture has completely changed. This could be due to the virus mutating into a weaker form as it sweeps across the world. Another theory is that social distancing measures and use of PPE such as face masks mean that people are being exposed to lower viral loads, and therefore becoming less ill. This could even mean that the bug dies out before a vaccine is available, according to Prof Bassetti. Probably it could go away completely without a vaccine. We have fewer and fewer people infected and it could end up with the virus dying out, he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said work is under way to stockpile Covid- jabs so theyaposre available straight awaya vaccine is approved. On Thursday, he told the Downing Street briefing that drug company AstraZeneca has already started manufacturing a jab being produced by scientists at Oxford University.

Scientists estimate that the closely-monitored R rate jumped to . after a raft of localised outbreaks. The figure is a sharp increase from . on Friday, far above the level needed to contain the deadly virus over the longer term.Germany has so far fared better in the pandemic than many European peers duemainly to early testing and social distancing measures.The Robert Koch Institutefor public health attributed the rise to a number of local outbreaks, which have been seen in locations such as meatpacking plants, logistics centres, and shelters for refugees. Outbreaks have also been linked to church services and family parties. The premier of the western North Rhine-Westphalia region warned on Friday it faces the threat of a renewed lockdown amid a spiralling outbreak at a major slaughterhouse. Since case numbers in Germany are generally low, these outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the reproduction number, RKI said. A nationwide increase in case numbers is not anticipated.

receiving a £, funding boost from Aberdeen Harbour Board.Community Food Initiatives North Eastsay the cargo bike will allow volunteers to deliver fresh food and emergency parcels for those who cannot make their way to the premises for health or mobility reasons.It will ensure the social enterprise can reach those in self-isolation in the Torry, Cove and Kincorth areas to hand out vital supplies throughout the pandemic.Among the usual essential food items being dropped off, there will be growing packs so that families can produce their own vegetables.The bike will also help to reduce the charity#s carbon footprint.The chief executive of Aberdeen Harbour Board, Michelle Handforth, praised the group for carrying out #outstanding work# during a dficult time.She said: “The donation will ensure more families and iniduals can receive vital supplies, in a way which reduces carbon emissions and raises awareness of alternative transport options.”Since lockdown measures were implemented,  the food bank has been handing out hundreds of parcels every day.Deputy chief executive of Cfine, Fiona Rae, said the donation would help them to cope with an increasingly high level of demand.She said: “The demand for emergency food has tripled since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak.#Cfine is delivering over , emergency parcels weekly to people experiencing food insecurity.#The electric cargo bike will be put to good use delivering emergency parcels, food growing packs, and fruit and vegetable boxes across Aberdeen and in the surrounding areas, while reducing Cfine’s carbon footprint.”The food bank has received lots of support from the local community as it battles to prevent people from going hungry.Pupils at Ferryhill School launched an -day campaign this week to collect food and household cleaning items for the organisation.And residents of Norfolk Road in Broomhill have been doing weekly dance routines with the intention of raising money for the social

gardens blow1","story":"North-east pub bosses have been left counting the cost by splashing out thousands to reopen beer gardens only for the decision to be delayed for a fortnight.Outdoor areas of pubs and restaurants will not be opening as part of the initial move into phase two of the exit from lockdown.It had been expected that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would allow them to welcome back customers this weekend but this has been delayed until a review on July .At her daily briefing yesterday, Ms Sturgeon said: “I very much hope to see people able to have a pint – or some of us would prefer a glass of wine or a gin and tonic – in a beer garden before too long.“But I want to make sure that’s safe.” vw, px\"  Venues in the north-east have spent thousands of pounds preparing for the restrictions being lted with social distancing measures, hand sanitiser, screens and contactless payment in place.Some have also brought staff back from the furlough scheme in preparation for the first few pints being served up.Paul Clarkson operations director from PB Devco said he has spent around £, on making sure Soul on Union Street and Bieldside Inn were ready to open their beer gardens.He believes ministers have “shted the goalposts” with the decision on outdoor pubs and said they are “ready to go” once they get the green light.​Paul said: #All our tables weren#t big enough to accommodate social distancing but they were bolted down, so we had to take them out and get the whole outside area re-paved.#We also had to get benches made specially by a local joiner to ensure they were more than two metres long.#We definitely feel like the Scottish Government has shted the goalposts at the last minute. There is no way the decision not to let pubs reopen outdoor areas was only made on Thursday morning, and yet there was no heads up.#They could have said days before that it wouldn#t be happening and that would have given people time to prepare. But they have led us up the garden path.#The routemap showed in black and white that outdoor areas could open again in phase two.#We were ready to go, and the good thing is when we are eventually able to open we will still be ready.#David Hayfield, who owns the Seafield Arms in Whitehills, said he has spent thousands of pounds on hand sanitisers and other necessary measures.He also thinks the First Minister needs to give pubs and hotels at least seven days notice before any restriction is lted.David said: “We have a large beer garden and we have had all the tables set out to adhere to social distancing.“We spent a lot of money on hand sanitisers, plastic cups and plastic food containers.“In terms of getting for this we have spent about £, on the all the equipment.“She really needs to give one weeks notice for this because some pubs will need that time to get ready.“We are ready now but a lot of other places won’t be.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"draw your own ee picture gallery north east kids get creative during lockdown2006","story":"Children across the north-east have been showcasing their artistic skills with their own version of the Evening Express# front page.More than  images were submitted and we#ve featured every picture in our gallery below."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/5e9eb1f7c7a5c4.27825635-scaled.jpg ","title":"aberdeen boss hopes for uefa help for away teams in european qualifiers","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes hopes UEFA will provide financial helpthe Reds are drawn away from home in Europe next season.The Dons face one-legged ties in the Europa League next season after UEFA scrapped the traditional home and away format for the qualiers following the Covid- outbreak.European football’s governing body pushed through that change in order to prevent a fixture backlog.That decision was made following a video conference meeting of UEFA’s executive committee earlier this week.McInnes wants UEFA to give financial aid clubs drawn away from home in the qualying rounds of the Europa League and Champions League.Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the first qualying round stage on August .The draw for the first qualying round, with a date yet to be confirmed, will determine which club will play the single leg in their own stadium.Should Aberdeen be drawn away from home, the club would face flight and hotel costs.McInnes said: “Itis something that was muted a few weeks ago and it kind of makes sense, the fact that we are behind with the scheduling and have to work our way through these early rounds quickly.“Obviously we will do what we are told with that.“As it is a one-off game, we will treat it like a cup game anyway like we would do domestically.“We will look forward to it when it comes round.“Obviously there is still a lot to be claried on that.“If we are drawn as the away team whether we can get some support from UEFA to meet the financial cost of that.“We will see how it comes out.“It is good that we have that date as well as it is something to work towards # t hat European competition on August .”Evendrawn at home, the chance to generate cash will be limited as Euro qualiers will be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic.Aberdeen will compete in Europe for a seventh successive season under McInnes.They have yet to reach the lucrative group stages, which would bring a multi-million cash bonus with prize money.With Aberdeen facing a £ million financial black hole due to the coronavirus crisis, travel costs for an away tie with no income would be another costly hit.Club chairman Dave Cormack recently confirmed Aberdeen have entered into talks with players, management and staff about the need to make wage cuts.Talks are ongoing at the club.The financial situation facing the Dons was described as #stark# by Cormack because supporters are not expected tofully until January at the earliest.The SPFL have set an August  date for the start of the Premiership season, although that will be dependent on the coronavirus situation within Scotland. Eventhe league begins when scheduled, all games will be behind closed doors.McInnes believes it is important to have dates to work towards both domestically and in the Europa League.Askedthe August  target was realistic, he said: “Yes, I think so.“We work in tandem with how society is dealing with the virus and we are getting a bit of encouragement of late.“Obviously we need that to continue but all the noises and everything we are hearing is that we will be ready for August .“I think it is important that we have a date to work towards.“You see the English Premeir League kicking off on Wednesday night and it just whets the appetite again to get involved.”The English top flight ed this week as Sheffield United drew - with Aston Villa and Manchester City beat Arsenal -. It gave a tantalising glimpse to Scottish football fans of what could be ahead in August.McInnes said: “Hopefully we can get into larger numbers and start to get  v  and game-related practices and get contact again with the players.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again.

Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Its five seams ied in width from one to three metres, the best coal lying m deep and requiring innovative deep mining technology to extract.The new steam engines solved the perennial problem of pumping out water.Being next to Morrisonrsquos Haven for easy transport, Prestongrange, by Prestonpans, was the first major pit in the s.With the help of a beam engine from Cornwall, it went deep in .A second pit with shafts under the Forth was sunk at Prestonlinks in .

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow.

This would involve ldquothe introduction of a wealth tax for high net worth iniduals.ldquoThe pandemic, MacDonald says, ldquohas underscored and highlighted the many inequalities that exist in the UK. GDP shouldnrsquot be the only measure of a nationrsquos success but also ldquohealth and social care, the environment, and the quality of le.Post-pandemic unemployment could be as high as %, MacDonald warns, and ldquois likely to be especially high in Scotland given the structure of the Scottish economy.ldquoA new form of social contract will be needed as we move out of the pandemic, he says.The government should ldquoinstigate a wellbeing fiscal stimulus hellip that has a major focus on greening the economy.That means ldquonoto austerity policies, and a focus on building ldquosocial capital to create a stronger, more connected society. Simply focusing on growth, rather than human happiness, is not enough.MacDonald says: ldquoThe prioritising of health and wellbeing during the pandemic indicates that there should not be an exclusive focus on economic growth but a sht to a more holistic wellbeing measure such a measure should recognise the deficiencies of the pre-pandemic economy in terms of inequalities, a reliance on relatively low paid and insecure jobs and a lack of resilience in health and social care.MacDonaldrsquos call for such revolutionary change will be listened to by governments and policy-makers around the world given his distinguished background. Hersquos currently professor of macroeconomics and international finance at Glasgow University.MacDonald, who is an OBE, has consistently been ranked amongst the worldrsquos top % of economists. Hersquos worked with the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank.His paper will be published by the think-tank Policy Scotland. Itrsquos titled ldquoThe Post Pandemic New Normal: the likely socio-economic implications and policy choices facing Scotland and the UK.MacDonald says: ldquoThe current dire straits engulfing the whole global community is unique in the sense that all governments are facing a stark trade-off between the health and well-being of their populations and maintaining the economic efficiency of their economies.The pandemic has also ldquoexacerbated the decline of globalisation as a ldquocentral component of the current world order. The current crisis could be the ldquofinal nail in the coffin of globalisation.The economic threat from pandemic has been heightened by ldquoa prolonged period of under-investment in developed economies. The economic response to the pandemic by governments ldquohas been uncoordinated.The threat of inflation is growing. ldquoIf inflation does start to take off then hellip there may at some point be a need to raise nominal interest rates sharply, he warns, adding: ldquoThe focus would then need to switch to what public spending would need to be cut or what taxes to raise. Given that there seems to be no appetite for spending-induced austerity now, it would seem hellip that the time to start planning for eventual tax changes is now hellip specically in terms of reforming the tax system.Therersquos likely to be ldquoa reduced appetite for risk by the private sector and an increased risk aversion with increased precautionary savings on the part of consumers and low investment by business as a consequence. Levels of debt are ldquoeyewatering. The ldquoimmediate impact of the pandemic could see ldquoa collapse in commodity prices.TAX REFORMThe damage to the economy from pandemic presents a stark choice: tax hikes or spending cuts. MacDonald says: ldquoGiven the austerity imposed after the financial crisis is one of the contributing factors to the lack of resilience in the health service and other public services during the pandemic we rule this out as an option. Which leaves taxes as the main vehicle to deliver rectitude in debt and deficit.MacDonald sees ldquothe post-Covid landscape presenting an ldquoideal opportunity to consider tax reform.ldquoIt is crucial, he says, ldquothat any tax changes that are introduced should not impede the recovery and there seems to be a growing consensus among economists that any such changes should be focussed on wealthy iniduals rather than increasing business taxes.Inequality has ldquobeen deeply intensied during the pandemic. MacDonald says: ldquoPerhaps, the time has now come for the stakeholder model of capitalism to replace the shareholder model. Fty years ago, .% of corporate revenues went to shareholders - today its %.Post-pandemic recovery will ldquorequire taxes to change. MacDonald says: ldquoGiven the large inequalities within the UK today any new system should be progressive and in large measure should avoid income and goods and services taxes.ldquoTo this end, a permanent reduction in labour taxes such as national insurance would clearly be an obvious alternative to the salary subsidies that have been given during the lockdown and would help to maintain employment levels as the recovery phase proceeds, he says.ldquoFurthermore, such a reduction in the tax wedge would give entrepreneurs the incentive to expand existing business and also invest in sectors that will become more attractive post-pandemic. It would be a mistake to pay for the lower taxes on labour by increasing corporation tax, given that an increased investment spend will be essential to permanent recovery from the recession.ldquoA wealth tax would be a credible tax on capital and is becoming increasingly popular particularly given the nature of inequalities prevalent in the UK.MacDonald also suggests a land tax as it ldquodoes not affect economic efficiency and can reduce inequality. Business rates and council tax should also be reformed, and small and medium-sized companies should be assisted by grants not loans.THE UNEMPLOYMENT CRISISUnemployment in Britain is likely to hit % by the end of the year, or even in the worst-case scenario reach %. MacDonald warns: ldquoGiven the structure of the Scottish economy, the unemployment situation in Scotland is likely to be worse than that in the UK. Scotlandrsquos dependence on the oil and hospitality sectors, and high-end food and drink exports, leave the nation vulnerable.As well as ldquothe permanent shutting of some businesses, MacDonald worries about ldquothe replacement of people with technology-driven alternatives.The ldquoblight of unemployment, he says, is ldquothe inevitable consequence of the pandemic.As lockdown eases, ldquothere is considerable uncertainty over whether people will lsquobinge spendrsquo to release pent-up demand for goods hellip or will save as a precaution due to the uncertainty in the economy.The job market will change dramatically. ldquoPeople will have to train and retrain a number of times throughout their lives and governments will have to help make that possible.Post-pandemic unemployment will ldquocreate greater inequalities in society, mostly affecting the low skilled, those on low incomes and the young. The crisis risks ldquocreating a lsquolockdown generationrsquo with permanent scarring.The ldquofracturing of globalisation hellip could also lead to a sharp fall in demand from abroad. Governments will have to stimulate the economy by ldquoincreasing investment in infrastructure hellip such spending will, of course, have further implications for the fiscal deficit and public debt.RADICAL RECOVERYKey to MacDonaldrsquos vision of post-pandemic economics is ldquothe greening of the Scottish economy. This, he believes, ldquocould generate many new jobs in construction and energy. Climate change, says MacDonald, is the pandemicrsquos ldquotwin.ldquoLow-carbon-recovery could not only initiate the signicant emissions reduction needed to halt climate change but also create more jobs and economic growth than a high-carbon recovery would, he says.MacDonald believes building lsquosocial capitalrsquo - strong, positive connections between ordinary people - is another key to recovery. He cites the  million Britons who have volunteered to help during the pandemic.ldquoSocial capital is at least as important as human and physical capital in driving forward socio-economic progress, both in terms of GDP and of wider measures of prosperity such as wellbeing. However, the move in many western societies to inidualism has led to a dramatic breakdown hellip of social capital.MacDonald adds: ldquoWestern liberal democracies have moved from societies based on the market to a market society, where the market governs our lives, and where a good, asset or service only has valueit is in a market and can be priced hellip In such a society, values such as solidarity, fairness, responsibility and compassion get downplayed and undervalued,not totally ignored.The pandemic, however, has taught us that we can prioritise ldquohealth and wellbeing before economic efficiency. There is also increasing evidence that people ldquowould prefer to prioritise health and wellbeing and other societal values over economic growth once the crisis is over.ldquoIn going forward, MacDonald suggests, ldquothe UK and Scottish governments should not make GDP their exclusive target for the nationsrsquo overall wellbeing. Health, social care, the environment and quality of le also matter.Governments need to ldquoemphasise wellbeing creation as the ultimate goal of kick-starting productivity and growth, rather than a sole focus on wealth creation. This would be a ldquomajor reprioritisation of our society.Governments should have been better prepared for a pandemic. ldquoThe appropriate form of resilience in the public and private sectors could and should have been in place, MacDonald says, adding: ldquoAs in the case of climate change, the current epidemic did not happen by chance but as a result of mankindrsquos rapacious demand for global resources.Post-pandemic, ldquogreater resilience in our health and social care systems must be built in. The World Health Organisation should be strengthened to coordinate any response to future pandemics.HOW LIFE WILL CHANGEWith ldquothe demise of the current globalisation era, countries will seek to be more resilient and self-sufficient at home. Building resilience in agriculture could led to innovations such as ldquovertical farming.However, ldquohome bias in other countries would have ldquorepercussions for the UK and Scottish export markets.MacDonald predicts that the rise of working at home during the pandemic will alter the housing market, as well as ldquoleisure, and the retail and hospitality sectors. Home-working could also ldquoreshape how people live and work in the central belt in Scotland. This would have knock-on effects for the environment, the shape of cities, and road traffic as well as health and happiness.ldquoIf a vaccine is not discovered and there are further mutations of this virus then there may be a steady migration from cities, MacDonald suggests. This could have ldquoimportant implications for house prices both in and out of the city and could lead to reduced inequality.Similarly, the sht to shopping online, e-learning in education, and also telemedicine will alter how we live and work."},{"url":null,"title":"notes-africa-became-tribal-elder","story":"He spared the tribe from further losses by agreeing to become a Muslim but lost a son, who was taken as a hostage to guarantee good faith of the tribe and likely died in Arabia, far from home.His successor negotiated with officials of the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium about their ancestral land round Nimule, a small bustling town on the Nile.The British official abruptly saw the way forward when several hundred silent but armed Madi rose from the dense grass surrounding the dirt airstrip on which his biplane had landed after one of the colonial soldiers rudely gestured with his rle at Chief Surur.Two years ago, I became an elder of the tribe. My elevation in status was painless. There were obligations but also a kudos or two. The upsides included being given a chair with armrests at formal meetings in the familyrsquos thatched gazebo as opposed to scrabbling round on the floor seeking a space on a grass mat.Elders are also served food first, a young niece pouring water over the hands before and after the meal, which is always eaten with the fingers of one hand.I could wear the delightfully cool Madi cotton tunic but was wary of the white turban unless a nimble-fingered girl was around to secure it. Wearing the family Reid clan tartan kilt was not approved by my African clan who tactfully observed the high temperatures and humidity would inevitably result in the scratching of itchy loins, thus lowering concentration at crucial moments in an argument.When our family were hosts, I was expected to advise on alcoholic drinks. If a fellow elder was likely, on the evidence of his previous track record, to be obstructive or overbearing, I ensured a plentul supply of home-brewed waragi, a sugar-cane based spirit, was at hand. This was offered to him by the cupful before any fraught subject was to be debated.The negative burdens were the erratic starting times of family meetings and the wildly elastic agendas of the larger community ones, which tended to be boisterous, open-ended and foodless.Worse was the procession of relatives turning up for advice at our farm during the day, although it may have been purest chance that this often coincided with the main meal being served. As a result, we built a high metal gate at our entrance that was padlocked and onlythe invisible supplicant could convince Florence, our sceptical and worldly-wise cook, of the urgency of the matter would she let them in.Our car was small and deliberately filled with empty containers and boxes to discourage would-be passengers who often did not mind where you were actually going. Such measures were not purely selfish but a matter of economic survival.It is assumed that aunts and uncles ing from the diaspora like us are rich and can continuously fund a mini-welfare state from birth, through schooling, to marriage dowries and burial feasts.Limited by language and relying on a translator, my initial contribution to meetings was confined to sucking a pipe while looking serious. I continually consulted cousins, brothers-in-law and ancient but very alert aunts who advised on what was culturally and politically acceptable.These advisers included a city lawyer, the former regional attorney general of Port Sudan, a foreign-exchange dealer, the senior procurement manager of a large government department in Juba, and our neighbour and nephew, a workaholic farmer whose cattle, chickens and goats take priority over his wives and family.Thanks to their advice, I now greet unwelcome and unasked-for comments or politically poisoned suggestions with a grunt, then slowly raise my eyes to the far-off mountains round Lake Albert where they stay, unblinking, until the message is received.Dr David Vost studied medicine at Glasgow University and is currently working at a hospital in Swaziland.

Stepping outside in the morning is like entering the Usher Hall during warm-up, a discordant and energetic orchestra of flutes, pipes and trumpets.

On our first social gathering in months ndash a glass of wine in a neighbourrsquos garden one warm evening ndash Wilf landed on the lawn beside us, hopping behind our chairs, and unperturbed by our friendsrsquo inquisitive dog. Clearly he considers every garden to be his private food department. Theirs is Fortnum and Mason to our Lidl.A barn owl has been seen in the village lately, out hunting before dark. The photos show a beautul, ghostly creature with a heart-shaped pale face, after which Hoolet is named. It was gliding low between trees and across the edge of rough fields. I hope it kept its distance from the blue tits, because other birdsrsquo chicks are the perfect snack for owls and their owlets. That comes as little surprise, but it wasnrsquot till recently that I learned that the woodpeckers haunting our garden might be lingering near the nestbox in hope of a tasty snack. A large one had taken up position on the gatepost, a few days ago, within earshot of the nest. Squirrels, meanwhile, are the stuff of blue titsrsquo horror movies. They have been known to gnaw away at a nestbox entrance to reach the birds inside.The charm most of us find in bird le and nature is often a rose-tinted perspective. For birds, every day is a challenge, a survival exercise tougher than anything the SAS could conceive. Often Irsquoll see the older blue tits, decidedly dishevelled, stuffing themselves on our peanut feeders as they boost their blood sugar levels ahead of another caterpillar hunt. Occasionally a scattering of feathers in the flowerbeds indicate where a cat has brought down a weary or unwary bird. The RSPB says that the avian massacre by cats ndash estimated to be over  million a year ndash is a natural winnowing, with only the weak or ill falling prey. Irsquom not convinced. It sounds like a half-truth, aimed to prevent all-out conflict between bird and feline lovers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.Danger is all around,yoursquore small and feathered. Friends were out for a walk beyond Hoolet recently, and spotted a flock of sparrows, feeding on grass-heads. Suddenly, not six feet away from them, a sparrowhawk swooped and snatched one of the birds. The speed of the attack, and the hawkrsquos audacity, were startling.Nor was this a first sighting of this turbo-charged predator that moves at the speed of a bullet. Occasionally I catch one ing between our house and a neighbourrsquos garden. As it flashes past the kitchen window, you know this is no idle reconnaissance. From its perch high in the sycamore, it has spied something delicious. The best you can hope is that, for the creature caught in its crosswires, the end is mercully swt.With less traffic, you see far fewer birds flattened on the roads, especially pheasants, which usually seem positively eager to examine the chassis of approaching cars. Our neighbours were nevertheless worried that theyrsquod found a pegged-out pheasant among their poppies. Hearing them calling to us through the beech hedge ndash by now almost as impenetrable as the Berlin Wall ndash we hurried over to offer first-aidrequired.The glittering, fearless ndash and pea-brained  ndash beauty, which has been parading our gardens since springtime, was far from dead. It had simply settled itself into an earthy dip to enjoy the sun. This would explain the dusty hollows Irsquove been finding of late in the shrubbery, asan easter egg-sized UFO had landed. Unfazed by the humans clucking anxiously around it, the pheasant only roused itself and got to its feet when it heard us approaching on the gravel.Another frequent visitor is the young hedgehog which has taken to walking up the road to the house, around tea-time, and disappearing into the back garden. Seeing it approach, I stuck my head out of the door into the pouring rain, and noticed it has a limp. Seen from behind, it lurched on one hind leg, like a trolley with a wonky wheel. Since it was going at a lick, and obviously knew exactly where it was heading, I left it to get on with it.Itrsquos a matter of days before the blue tits will be out of their nest, and bouncing around the garden. In a second-hand bookshop last year I found a guide to making your garden more bird friendly. In a chapter on building nestboxes for dferent species, it advised that, after the breeding season, these boxes must be cleaned, to protect future broods from disease. This must be how landlords feel when the end of a tenancy is approaching. The need to disinfect is clearly universal. Unique to providers of avian accommodation, however, is the warning to brace yourselves for finding addled eggs, or the remains of chicks that failed to thrive.

On our first social gathering in months ndash a glass of wine in a neighbourrsquos garden one warm evening ndash Wilf landed on the lawn beside us, hopping behind our chairs, and unperturbed by our friendsrsquo inquisitive dog. Clearly he considers every garden to be his private food department. Theirs is Fortnum and Mason to our Lidl.A barn owl has been seen in the village lately, out hunting before dark. The photos show a beautul, ghostly creature with a heart-shaped pale face, after which Hoolet is named. It was gliding low between trees and across the edge of rough fields. I hope it kept its distance from the blue tits, because other birdsrsquo chicks are the perfect snack for owls and their owlets. That comes as little surprise, but it wasnrsquot till recently that I learned that the woodpeckers haunting our garden might be lingering near the nestbox in hope of a tasty snack. A large one had taken up position on the gatepost, a few days ago, within earshot of the nest. Squirrels, meanwhile, are the stuff of blue titsrsquo horror movies. They have been known to gnaw away at a nestbox entrance to reach the birds inside.The charm most of us find in bird le and nature is often a rose-tinted perspective. For birds, every day is a challenge, a survival exercise tougher than anything the SAS could conceive. Often Irsquoll see the older blue tits, decidedly dishevelled, stuffing themselves on our peanut feeders as they boost their blood sugar levels ahead of another caterpillar hunt. Occasionally a scattering of feathers in the flowerbeds indicate where a cat has brought down a weary or unwary bird. The RSPB says that the avian massacre by cats ndash estimated to be over  million a year ndash is a natural winnowing, with only the weak or ill falling prey. Irsquom not convinced. It sounds like a half-truth, aimed to prevent all-out conflict between bird and feline lovers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.Danger is all around,yoursquore small and feathered. Friends were out for a walk beyond Hoolet recently, and spotted a flock of sparrows, feeding on grass-heads. Suddenly, not six feet away from them, a sparrowhawk swooped and snatched one of the birds. The speed of the attack, and the hawkrsquos audacity, were startling.Nor was this a first sighting of this turbo-charged predator that moves at the speed of a bullet. Occasionally I catch one ing between our house and a neighbourrsquos garden. As it flashes past the kitchen window, you know this is no idle reconnaissance. From its perch high in the sycamore, it has spied something delicious. The best you can hope is that, for the creature caught in its crosswires, the end is mercully swt.With less traffic, you see far fewer birds flattened on the roads, especially pheasants, which usually seem positively eager to examine the chassis of approaching cars. Our neighbours were nevertheless worried that theyrsquod found a pegged-out pheasant among their poppies. Hearing them calling to us through the beech hedge ndash by now almost as impenetrable as the Berlin Wall ndash we hurried over to offer first-aidrequired.The glittering, fearless ndash and pea-brained  ndash beauty, which has been parading our gardens since springtime, was far from dead. It had simply settled itself into an earthy dip to enjoy the sun. This would explain the dusty hollows Irsquove been finding of late in the shrubbery, asan easter egg-sized UFO had landed. Unfazed by the humans clucking anxiously around it, the pheasant only roused itself and got to its feet when it heard us approaching on the gravel.Another frequent visitor is the young hedgehog which has taken to walking up the road to the house, around tea-time, and disappearing into the back garden. Seeing it approach, I stuck my head out of the door into the pouring rain, and noticed it has a limp. Seen from behind, it lurched on one hind leg, like a trolley with a wonky wheel. Since it was going at a lick, and obviously knew exactly where it was heading, I left it to get on with it.Itrsquos a matter of days before the blue tits will be out of their nest, and bouncing around the garden. In a second-hand bookshop last year I found a guide to making your garden more bird friendly. In a chapter on building nestboxes for dferent species, it advised that, after the breeding season, these boxes must be cleaned, to protect future broods from disease. This must be how landlords feel when the end of a tenancy is approaching. The need to disinfect is clearly universal. Unique to providers of avian accommodation, however, is the warning to brace yourselves for finding addled eggs, or the remains of chicks that failed to thrive.

In fact, experts have issued it countless times for many years now. Had most of us been aware of this other threat, the chances are we would have dismissed it anyway as something unlikely to impact on our lives directly. In that assumption we would have been dangerously wrong.As experts at the Geneva-based World Economic Forumpointed out earlier this month, Covid- is not the only risk with the ability to quickly and exponentially disrupt the way we all live. Or, as they more succinctly described it, our ldquonew normal isnrsquot Covid- itself, itrsquos Covid-like incidents.What these experts are referring to is the inevitability of a global cyber pandemic, one that would spread faster and further than any biological virus, impacting upon, and potentially devastating, many aspects of our lives.Sounds far-fetched and too sci-fi to be believable  Then think again. Just check the news from Australia this weekend where the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has confirmed that a state-sponsored cyber attack is currently under way, targeting Australian government, business, education and political organisations. While experts say this latest attack in Australia is not particularly sophisticated, they have been so persistent there that the government felt now was the time to speak out. The same experts warned that the current hacking should serve as a wake-up call to the overall massive rise in cyber attacks and their potential to wreak havoc in the future with the outbreak of an online pandemic.One of those experts, Dan Lohrmann, writing recently for the US magazine Government Technology, detailed through the prism of the American experience the duration over which such warnings have been given and their signicance.ldquoFor more than a decade, security leaders predicted that a Cyber Pearl Harbour or Cyber   was coming that would dramatically change society as we know it, said Lohrmann.In his assessment, he cites Janet Napolitano, former US Secretary of Homeland Security, who as far back as  warned that America ldquo will, at some point, face a major cyber event that will have a serious effect on our lives, our economy and the everyday ing of our society.But as Covid- has revealed, such attacks were never only going to be limited to the US. Right now evidence is mounting daily that state-backed hackers are seizing on the Covid- pandemic to lead cyber espionage transnationally at a time when home working and anxiety about infection are making populations more vulnerable to online hacking.ldquoAttacks have always been socially engineered to prey on peoplersquos fears, habits, and ultimately, their bank accounts, but the exploitation in the Covid- era is nothing short of sinister, warned Christopher Gerg, an information security expert writing in Security magazine last month.Just how sinister is borne out by the extent to which hackers have been exploiting employees whose working environment has radically changed as a result of Covid-.ldquoWork from home is a goldmine for spies, James Lewis, cyber security expert at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, told the Financial Times recentlyldquoThe Chinese in particular benefit because it gives them more and easier targets to go after and they have the resources to take advantage of a surge in easier targets.In April, a rare joint assessment released by Britainrsquos National Cyber Security Centrendash a branch of signals intelligence agency GCHQ ndash and the USrsquo Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agencyndash part of the Department of Homeland Security ndash highlighted the ldquogrowing use of Covid- in state-sponsored cyber attacks.In the parlance of what security experts call ldquoAdvanced Persistent Threat groups, hackers working on behalf of nation states such as China, Russia and Iran among many nations are making the most of the outbreak to spy on their adversaries, according to NCSC and CISA.It would be naive to imagine, of course, that both those same UK and US intelligence communities are not themselves doing likewise. Various reports have already surfaced over the extent to which numerous Chinese organisations or institutions, for example, have been the subject of scrutiny by the US, UK and others.Evidence presented in the recent US-UK joint assessment of cyber security breaches here in Britain give some idea of how the coronavirus has upped the ante of such activity on all sides.ldquoAPT groups are using the Covid- pandemic as part of their cyber operations, the US version of the report reads. ldquoTheir goals and targets are consistent with longstanding priorities such as espionage and lsquohack-and-leakrsquo operations.Underlining the scale of the threat from state entities, the Reuters news agency last month reported that hackers linked to Iran targeted Gilead, the US-based pharmaceutical company that makes the anti-Covid drug Remdesivir.According to experts who reviewed web archives for Reuters, the hacking infrastructure used in the attempt to compromise the email account of an executive at Gilead had previously been used in cyber attacks by a group of suspected Iranian hackers known by the bizarre name ldquoCharming Kitten. Such colourful or quaint code names are not uncommon in the cyber world and often veil the seriousness of such a grouprsquos impact.ldquoAccess to even just the email of staff at a cutting-edge Western pharmaceutical company could give ... the Iranian government an advantage in developing treatments and countering the disease, said Priscilla Moriuchi, a director with US cyber security firm Recorded Future, and former analyst with the US National Security Agency.Responding to the hacking claims, Iranrsquos mission to the United Nations denied any involvement in the attacks.ldquoThe Iranian government does not engage in cyber warfare, spokesman Alireza Miryousefi told the news agency. ldquoCyber activities Iran engages in are purely defensive and to protect against further attacks on Iranian infrastructure, the spokesman added.Just as in the Gilead case, other state-backed hackers are using similar email ldquolures to entice government officials, academics and employees at public health bodies into clicking on links that give access to their organisationsrsquo networks.The World Health Organisationis another recent example, reporting that it has experienced a fivefold increase in cyber attacks compared to this time last year. Some were clearly motivated by profit as much as intelligence gathering.Many of these attacks on the global health watchdog were targeted at the general public with emails that spoofed WHO employeesrsquo emails asking for donations. Common ldquophishing scams include emails claiming to come from the director-general of the WHO, and others claiming to offer thermometers and face masks.ldquoThe virus crisis has brought new intelligence requirements: countries now want to know what other governments are doing about the virus, they want to find out details about vaccines, to make sure theyrsquore aware of the latest developments, the Financial Times cited one security official as saying a few months ago.ldquoSo as well as all the usual intelligence sources theyrsquore now focusing on academic organisations that might be doing modelling, people working on public policy responses, scientists who are advising government, the official added.ldquoNation states are asking for new types of intelligence so hackers are pivoting to answer those questions.But it is attacks on the health institutions and related services at the height of the global pandemic that have both alarmed and outraged cyber security experts and others.Many point to the fact that hospitals and public-sector organisations that deal with health and social care can be particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks.There are historical precedents here, of course, in the shape of the devastating global cyber attack in  that crippled computers in hospitals across the UK and cost the NHS around pound million.The so called WannaCry hack, which shut down hundreds of thousands of computers around the world with messages from hackers demanding ransom payments, hit a third of hospital trusts and % of GP practices. Around % of all NHS care was disrupted over the course of a week.The hack caused more than , appointments to be cancelled, costing the NHS pound million between May  and May  of that year, and poundm in the subsequent clean-up and upgrades to its information technology systems.The WannaCry hack caused , computers to lock out users with red-lettered error messages demanding the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. According to investigators, those responsible for the global attack were North Korean hackers known as Lazarus, an elite group. While the attack didnrsquot specically target the NHS, it spread over the internet using a leaked hacking tool developed by the US spy agency the NSA.And here lies the obvious parallel with Covid-, a cyber attack that creates an infection, but one that would spread faster and further than any biological virus. Over these past months many of us have become familiar with what is known as the R number or reproduction value by which a diseasersquos ability to spread is rated.Should the reproductive rate ndash or R ndash of Covid- be on average around two without any social distancing, then each infected person passes the virus to a couple of other people.By contrast, as cyber security experts at the World Economic Forum have recently pointed out, estimates of R of cyber attacks are  and above. One of the fastest worms ndash as they are known ndash in history was the  Slammer Sapphire worm, which doubled in size approximately every . seconds, spreading to over , infected devices in  minutes and . million devices in  hours.To give some sense of scale as to what this means, a virus with a reproductive rate of  may take only five days to infect over one billion devices.The economic impact of such a global virus and subsequent digital shutdown would, say WEF experts, be of the same magnitude or greater than what we are currently seeing as a result of Covid-.ldquoThe only way to stop the exponential propagation of cyber-Covid would be to fully disconnect all vulnerable devices from one another and the internet to avoid infection, say Professor Nicholas Davis and Algirde Pipikate, the cybersecurity experts who complied the WEF assessment.To put this in some kind of context the end result would mean millions of devices would be taken offline in a matter of days.A single day without the internet would cost the world more than  billion, while a -day global cyber lockdown could cost over  trillion.ldquoThe whole world could experience cyber lockdown until a digital vaccine was developed. All business communication and data transfers would be blocked. Social contact would be reduced to people contactable by in-person visits, copper landline, snail mail or short-wave radio, the experts added, describing a nightmarish scenario that more than mirrors Covid- and the impact it has had on all our lives economically in the past few months.Just as warnings have existed for many years over a global biological pandemic so likewise they have existed regarding a cyber pandemic. The systemic cyber attacks that we are currently witnessing have shown themselves to be both easily deployed and dangerous.The point now, say those best able to judge the sale of the threat, is to fully anticipate them and have the necessary degree of preparedness. If Covid- has taught the world anything itrsquos that even a short delay in responding can cause colossal damage.As we tentatively begin to surface from these recent dark and devastating times, it might be hard to even contemplate more potential disaster.But as we now know from painful experience, fully recognising the extent of any threat and having the measures in place to cope must be a priority. After all, just as with a biological pandemic so with a cyber equivalent, we now know itrsquos not a question ofit will happen, but when.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

She said: ldquoI had expected the responses to be a bit more positive.ldquoPeople donrsquot think there is investment going back into local communities and that the stakeholders are not taking into account the problems they are facing.The survey, however, is just one indication of what appears to be mounting disquiet among a portion of residents. Social media forums buzz with comments from people anxious over what they regard as a rush to lure tourists back to areas with limited healthcare facilities.There is particular concern over recent comments by David Whiteford, chairman of the North Highland Initiative, the non-profit organisation which originally devised the NC idea. He suggested a need for more ldquouplting messages from the Scottish Government to allay residentsrsquo fears and encourage tourism, and an exploration of how the two-metre social distancing rules could be eased.His comments coincided with a survey by the business behind the route, North Coast  Ltd, which claimed % of respondents had not been put off visiting the route by the pandemic.ldquoA great many who live here are growing increasingly tired of being told whatrsquos good for us by these organisations, said one disgruntled resident who lives on the Ross and Cromarty stretch of the route.ldquoI canrsquot even hug my grandchildren.

It feeds into most peoplersquos view of the whole NC phenomenon. A lot of people feel it was foisted on them without consultation and it has changed the nature of tourism from lsquoslowrsquo to much more frantic.ldquoThey make a big deal of improved economic impact, but it has to be set against what people have lost.The NC tourism initiative was launched in .

Its lead author, Professor John Lennon, is an unpaid director at North Coast  Ltd, which promotes the route.Tom Campbell, executive chairman of North Coast  Ltd, said: ldquoWersquore very aware that businesses are part of every community and there needs to be a collective understanding of the need for businesses to open and the concerns that this has to be done by taking safe and measured steps.ldquoWe have consistently said that visitors should only travel when the Scottish Government says that it is safe to do so and we are not at that point yet.ldquoWe must ensure that there is a clear message about why tourism businesses can reopen to ensure that everyone knows that it is being done on the guidance of the Government.He added: ldquoWhether people are travelling in their own vehicle, or hiring one for their visit, we actively encourage visitors to observe our advice for safe driving on country and single-track roads, overnight parking, access rights, and waste disposal which is all available on our website.ldquoWhether people are travelling by car, bicycle, motorcycle, campervan, motorhome or foot, it is their responsibility to dispose of their waste responsibly.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them.

We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes.Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank.“That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.”Shnuggle also received a £, Small Business Grant.Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy.“So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving.” vw, px\"  Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.

But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes.Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank.“That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.”Shnuggle also received a £, Small Business Grant.Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy.“So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving.” vw, px\"  Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

Regressive taxation in the form of carbon and sugar taxes are included while corporation tax and the top rate of income tax remain unchanged.“It’s a deal that was negotiated in good faith but fails to deliver on our promise to tackle homelessness and provide better healthcare. It sets out an inadequate and vague pathway towards climate action.“A better deal is possible – voting no on this Programme for Government is a step towards securing that better deal.“Transformative change was called for by the electorate earlier this year. That call must be answered by not only the Green Party, but every party that promised positive change.”The Green Party has the highest threshold of the three parties to secure the approval of its membership.Two-thirds of members registered to vote on the proposals ahead of next Friday must back the deal.Just  of the Greens’  members north of the border have registered to vote on the draft programme for government.The eight people to sign the statement of opposition are Ms Bailey, Mr Duffy, Mr Costello, Ms Hourigan, Ms Chu, councillor Lorna Brogue and  general election candidates Sean McCabe and Saoirse McHugh.PAMost ReadNorthern Ireland doctor who hit out at #criminal# lack of PPE guilty of dishonestly claiming payAnger as DUP tries to name leisure centre after centenaryof Northern IrelandFather#s Day: NI personalities on what makes their dads so special Manarrested after Ballymena jewellery burglary UVF gang in -hour terror rampage,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Enquiries into the matter are ongoing.”Cara McCann, director of HERe NI, a campaign group for lesbian and bisexual women, said the letters were “harmful and initimidating”.She added: “HERe NI reported this to the PSNI.“We will continue to support these two women and other women who get this material and would urge people to seek support from LGBT sector organisationsthey have received this or similar literature.”But Freda Kerr, who distributed the leaflets and runs the Mid-Ulster Christian Help Line with her husband, said she had “no intention of stopping” and would go to prisonshe had to.She added: “It’s God’s word, not my word. We do it by way of the literature and we do to help people and people have been helped.”Aisling Twomey, LGBT Advocacy officer at The Rainbow Project, said incidents like this were “still a reality” for many in the community.She added: “This includes assault, vandalism, harassment and emotional abuse, not to mention the anti LGBT rhetoric used by political and religious organisations.“I would encourage anyone who has received literature such as this or has experienced intimidation as a result of their sexual orientation and or gender identity to report it to the police.“If they don’t feel comfortable speaking with the police, then they can speak directly to Advocacy officer based at The Rainbow Project who can report the incident andnecessary can do so anonymously.”Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland doctor who hit out at #criminal# lack of PPE guilty of dishonestly claiming payAnger as DUP tries to name leisure centre after centenaryof Northern IrelandFather#s Day: NI personalities on what makes their dads so special Manarrested after Ballymena jewellery burglary #We#re £, down... it might have been betterthe Primark fire had burnt us out# ...

Find out more about the TUI Holiday Promise  https:t.co MmdcAPSjo pic fOfoXun— tuiukJune , Richard Sofer, Tui’s commercial director, acknowledged the plan is dependent on the Government altering its position on travel advice and the two-week quarantine for international arrivals.He said the Foreign and Commonwealth Officewould need to stop advising against all non-essential oversea travel, and “air bridges” would need to be created enabling people to travel between the UK and certain countries without needing to go into self-isolation for  days at either end.Mr Sofer told the PA news agency: “Due to the size of our organisation we’ve been able to have a presence in each of those Government conversations through our aviation team or through the senior members of the UK business.“We’re well-informed of where those discussions are.“Obviously many of those conversations are confidential but that gives us great confidence to open up a small programme to a couple of really key countries, eight key gateways for us.“We have absolute confidence that we’re going to be getting a positive result from the Government in time for July.”Tui has not set a date for resuming long-haul trips.Rival travel firm Jetholidays plans to resume its holiday programme on July , but it has been forced to extend the suspension of its operations several times during the pandemic.Tui has already resumed taking customers from Germany on holiday, with trips to Portugal’s Algarve operating this week.Mr Sofer described the FCO’s stance on travel advice as “slightly unhelpful from a planning point of view”.He went on: “Our European colleagues have benefited where they’ve had clear lines in the sand and dates to be working to.“The UK position is effectively just under review, so it’s uncertain.”Mr Sofer said customers will experience “slight changes”they go on a Tui holiday this summer, such as social distancing requirements in resorts, but he insisted they will “still have a brilliant experience”.He went on: “When customers are in their hotels, on the beach, using the vast majority of the attractions and facilities in destinations, they’re going to be able to enjoy those destinations and experiences as they would under normal circumstances.“We’re not expecting hotels to be as full as they would have been pre-Covid-.“That will be helpful for creating extra spaces and allowing social distancing to be fulfilled without too much intervention and disruption to people’s holidays.”PAMost ReadNorthern Ireland doctor who hit out at #criminal# lack of PPE guilty of dishonestly claiming payAnger as DUP tries to name leisure centre after centenaryof Northern IrelandFather#s Day: NI personalities on what makes their dads so special Manarrested after Ballymena jewellery burglary UVF gang in -hour terror rampage,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

Ms Sheerin warned that beef and sheep farmers would be worst affected by the crisis and urged the Agriculture Minister to acknowledge this in the scheme. “There are , beef and sheep farmers in the north, and it is they who will be hardest hit,” she said. “As farmers face the prospect of Brexit and the severe weather, it is essential this funding should go where it is most needed. “The Agriculture Minister must heed the wishes of the Assembly before any scheme is finalised.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave.

Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during . The programme called them ldquospecial people.My own personal memory of Alfie will always be the toast he iniably delivered at the end of an eveningrsquos conviviality, of which there were many:ldquoMay you always walk in sunshineSlumber warm when night winds blowMay you always live with laughterFor a smile becomes you soThis article was first published on the CricketEurope website as part of a series paying tribute to those who have made signicant contributions to Irish cricket..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Traffic calming measures are needed at Castlewellan road  ","story":"TWO local Sinn Fein representatives have voiced their concern over speeding traffic on a Castlewellan road.MLA Emma Rogan and Cllr Roacuteisiacuten Howell say residents in the Burrenwood Road area have contacted them over the speed of some of the vehicles.However, they are both disappointed with the responsive their queries received from the Department of Infrastructure.Cllr Howell said that while the road met the criteria for traffic calming measures to be introduced and had been earmarked as a priority, the Department was unable to carry out the work at present.She remarked: ldquoWhile both myself and the local community welcome that Burrenwood Road has been recognised as a priority, it is extremely frustrating that due to an oversubscribed waiting list the work will not be carried out.ldquoItrsquos very annoying for us to hear the road now meets criteria but wonrsquot be completed due to it not sitting high enough on a waiting list.Cllr Howell added: ldquoThis is a disappointing response and I understand the frustration of residents.Ms Rogan said she would be contacting the Infrastructure minister to ascertain when the work will be carried out.She added: ldquoThe safety of pedestrians especially young children must be paramount..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Virtual meeting to support businesses affected by virus  ","story":"PLANS have been unveiled for a virtual meeting to help businesses across the district which have been severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor are organising a so-called lsquotown hallrsquo event designed to offer solutions for business operations post Covid-.The event mdash which takes place next Wednesday evening on Zoom at pm ndash will feature expert advice from a number of leading figures from the business world.They include Glyn Roberts of Retail Northern Ireland and Colin Neill of Hospitality NI, who will be joined by Tourism NIrsquos chief executive, John McGrillen.Mr McGrath and Cllr Trainor want as many businesses as possible to join the June  video conference event and ask the questions that matter to them.The Assemblyman believes that itrsquos incumbent on politicians, Northern Ireland Executive ministers and MPs to fight for businesses and help develop strategies that will benefit them post-coronavirus.ldquoNext weekrsquos virtual meeting is deigned to provide these businesses with key advice so that when they all reopen, they will continue providing the first class service they have been offering, in some instances, for decades, said Mr McGrath.ldquoI have been working with our local council SDLP team in establishing a video conference call with expert figures from this sector.Mr McGrath said next weekrsquos event will outline his partyrsquos plans for how it will work with local business as everyone prepares to exit lockdown.He added: ldquoI would encourage as many businesses as possible to get in touch and wersquoll get you connected with this quickly evolving network of local business support and advice.Cllr Trainor said while the financial support offered by the NI Executive to many businesses to help them cope with the challenges of coronavirus was welcome, his party was keen to explore what would happen post Covid- and what support would be required.He added: As a result of the initial shock and upheaval caused by the pandemic, businesses have lost a great deal and some have had to shut up shop entirely.ldquoThere is much fear and concern over what will happen to the businesses that are still operating, in particular, those in the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11494528.jpg","title":"government plan give drivers   switch electric car","story":"How will it work What would the scheme achieve This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The closure of churches is unprecedented in our letimes. Indeed, there are churches that have been open for worship every Sunday for hundreds of years that have now remained empty for months.However, churches are not solely places where people gather for corporate worship one day a week. Across all traditions in Northern Ireland, they are part of the daily lives of people. Prayer meetings, bible studies, children’s meetings, and a whole range of other activities and events take place in them. Many people have had to do without this community and the support that comes with it and this prolonged closure has had a signicant impact on the spiritual and mental wellbeing of many. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I fully appreciate and understand the frustration expressed by those who could not fathom why restaurants and shops were preparing to open, while churches had to remain closed. However, there are particular dficulties with people coming together in a church for a prolonged period of time, such as the greater possibility of the mingling of congregants and the risk it could pose to the spread of the disease. However, that risk can be managed and the benefits of reopening the churches would be hugely signicant. That’s why last week the First Minister announced the establishment of a Churches Working Group incorporating Executive Ministers and representatives of dferent faith groups, with the objective of charting a pathway to re-opening. The first meeting of that group took place on Wednesday. It was a really useful engagement and it demonstrated that churches had already put a lot of time and effort into creating comprehensive plans.As a result of their work and the engagement we had with the Chief Medical Officer, the Executive have been able to give an indicative date of th June for churches to reopen. I know churches and faith groups will have a lot of questions about what their services will look like, how many can attend and what measures they will need to have in place. The Churches Working Group will meet again next week so congregations will have clear guidance and time to prepare.It’s obvious though that we will not immediately go back to the way things were.There will be a new normal and there will be a phased approach. Le has changed immensely but I am pleased people will soon be able to meet again with their church families and participate in public worship.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Societies such as China have no independent media scrutiny of events and no fair or independent courts, so will never get on top of problems such as their endemic corruption. Instead the Communist Party is reduced to anti corruption drives, in which officials can be executed.In China, not only is there no free press but there is no free speech or right to protest.The massacre of pro reform students for demonstrating at Tiananmen in  is expunged from history and cannot be commemorated .We don’t even know how many died in Tiananmen: estimates begin in the hundreds. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In the West even a weekly paper with a few reporters can shed light on frauds, planning disputes, etc.A regional daily paper such as this one comes out more often and so can uncover even more.A national paper has still greater resources, and can reveal yet more.In Northern Ireland, the Renewable Heat Incentive saga was, at best, an administrative shambles in which public funds were squandered. The most accessible detailed account of RHI was written by a reporter on thispaper, Sam McBride.This the world’s oldest English language daily title, founded almost  years ago, in . I have read all the earliest surviving - editions, which seem primitive compared to today, yet were revolutionary. Prior to them, news spread by rumour, town crier or pamphlet. The late Jonathan Bardon told me that much of our understanding of King William’s journey to the Boyne to fight the Catholic James II comes from his chaplain’s diary. That  battle was decades before most newspapers. They suddenly provided a single place where key developments could be relayed to the public, at fixed time intervals. From that moment the workings of society became more transparent.The quest to provide news on everything, from war to celebrity to science, is evident in those early News Letters.If you go forward  years and read s editions, they are bigger and better than the s. Society is more advanced, helped by better information.Newspapers have endured ever since, despite falling circulationsin the TV age.Lockdown has not killed papers,but it has caused circulations to fall further. In recent weeks many people have subscribed to us to support our journalism see below how to do so. Among other examples of this paper providing scrutiny to an under examined issue is our querying of the slow theto schools, which we have done for more than a month Also our querying of how the legacy of the Troubles has turned against state forces who prevented civil war. Many people do not accept such a positive assessment of the role of the state, but I thinkmore people do than do not, yet you would never know that from the way legacy is panning out .There is not space here to detail the troubling saga around the handling of complaints about the RUC response to the  Loughinisland loyalist massacre. The murders were a grievous sectarian crime but their horror cannot mean ex RUC are not entitled to due process.Reports on these pages by Mark Rainey and analysis articles have examined the case, It is a complex saga that highlights the sweeping, misleading definition of collusion.The controversy began when the then Ombudsman Al Hutchinson issued a report which did not find collusion in the killings. Dr Michael Maguire, who as criminal justice inspector criticised that report, later became ombudsman. When the first report was quashed, he issued a new one that did find collusion.In , Mr Justice McCloskey was highly critical of the Maguire findings of collusion, as “unsustainable in law”. He said RUC officers “were, in effect, accused, tried and convicted without notice and in their absence. None of the essential elements of the criminal or disciplinary process existed”.It was devastating verdict. But then there was a highly unusual allegation of bias against him, which he firmly rejected, yet stood aside even so . There are grave doubts as to the appropriateness of him recusing himself in that way.Ms Justice Keegan later issued a completely dferent ruling to McCloskey. Wednesday’s appeal court ruling on Loughinisland, while it criticised Dr Maguire overstepping the mark in his collusion findings , does not settle the matter.

Was there a breakdown in communication at the executive or was it Mr Weir and the Department of Education caving in after outcry at the teachers’ union  Education leaders and politicians need to acknowledge that part-time education, be it one, two or even three days a week, and supplemented by home-schooling, will not be enough for long-suffering children.  What makes this even more uncomfortable for Mr Weir is that as he made an apparent u-turn on behalf of Stormont, Gavin Williamson, the UK education secretary, was declaring that all pupils at schools in England willto the classroom full-time in September.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Social distancing comes easily on Rathlin, the boot-shaped island that lies six miles north of Ballycastle across the Sea of Moyle.By Helen McGurkSaturday, th June , : am\"\"It is still unclear when tourists will be allowed back to Rathlin IslandBeautul, barren, and sparsely populated. Social distancing comes easily on Rathlin, the boot-shaped island that lies six miles north of Ballycastle across the Sea of Moyle. Mile after mile of this windswept craggy island can be strolled without encountering another living soul - when the tourists aren’t around, at least.For those in need of a little solitude, it’s perfect for a populace determined to keep a pandemic at bay, it’s even better.As coronavirus wreaked havoc across the globe, Rathlin’s offshore community acted fast to insulate themselves, halting ferry arrivals for all but the most essential travellers. The strategy has worked: there have been no cases of Covid- among its  residents. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Now, as restrictions are being eased in Northern Ireland and across the UK, the islanders are taking stock of the last few weeks and wondering what the future will look like for them. Michael Cecil, , who has lived on Rathlin since he was three-years-old, described the last couple of months as ‘surreal’.‘‘Once we got over the first two or three weeks with no traffic back and forward to the island, we were pretty secure there was no virus here. You could go to the beach and people’s gardens or meet each other on the road, without much of a risk. People enjoyed that and it was March and April when we generally wouldn’t have been that busy with tourism anyway.’’But Michael, a ferry skipper and current chair of the Rathlin Development Community Association, said it has been a dferent story in May and June - months when the island would normally have welcomed hundreds of tourists every day. ‘‘It is surreal on the island, because now that we have opened up again to limited traffic, people are enforcing all those social distancing measures, they are staying in their houses, so the island is extremely quiet - quieter than I can ever remember it. ‘‘In weather like this we would expect - visitors a day and it’s just not here. It’s strange and some people are quite happy with it because they are enjoying nature and enjoying the island as it should be. But then, anyone who is in tourism is finding it hard financially. A lot of people aren’t working, although thankfully there’s been support through the furlough scheme.’’Rathlin closed to tourists on March , and when it re-opens is still under review, but it is believed it will happen sooner, rather than later. According to Michael, attitudes to re-opening are ided. ‘‘There are polar opposites - people enjoying the quietness and then there are people who don’t enjoy it because of separation and isolation, It’s not been idyllic for everybody. ‘‘There were families that were separated, some people had ended up marooned on the mainland.There were people trying to run businesses and people building houses and finding it extremely dficult. ‘‘The ferry company and ourselves, as a community group, found it was increasingly dficult to try and make a decision on a day-to-day basis on whether an inidual should or shouldn’t be able to travel, because everyone had their case to make or had their own reasons. On an island with such a small population, that can get very personal.’’Michael said it has been particularly dficult for older residents. ‘‘There are quite a few elderly people on the island who live alone. A lot of people would have immediate and extended family on the mainland.’’Getting supplies has been a challenge at times too. ‘‘Groceries are dficult because most times you would go and get your own provisions or order them online,’’ said Michael.‘‘Both of those things are nearly impossible at the minute. Asda and Tesco will deliver to the ferry terminal in Ballycastle, but slots for deliveries are about three weeks in advance. This means more people are shopping locally through our little local shop, which has stayed open throughout, so that has been good for them.’’He added: ‘‘The pub has been closed, which would be a social centre on the island. People are getting a bit fed up with that.’’Rathlin’s two major events have also been cancelled this year - the week-long festival in mid July and the regatta in late August. But, on the plus side, residents are enjoying their natural environment.Rathlin has always been a magnet for nature lovers. The viewpoint at the western lighthouse provides wonderful views of Northern Ireland’s largest colony of seabirds. The cute seals, which drape over rocks, are a big draw for children on the many school trips which visit the island every May and June. During lockdown, Michael said nature has ‘‘exploded’’.‘‘Whether that’s the weather, lack of pollution or lack of tourism, we don’t know. Grass verges aren’t being cut so there’s a lot of wildflowers.‘‘We have quite a big population of Irish hares on the island. In the last few weeks they seem to have taken to exploring the roads, which they would never normally do and they were on the beach last week - nobody has ever seen that.‘‘The seals have stayed at the harbour, which they never normally do. They usually re-locate in the summer months, but they have just stayed there because they’ve not been disturbed or photographed.’’And as for the famous puffins, the are ‘‘just getting on with le’’.‘‘They are probably wondering where everybody is and what they’ve done wrong,’’ laughed Michael.Noel McCurdy is Rathlin’s postman and also looks after two of the lighthouses. He described the weeks in lockdown as ‘‘heaven’’, but recognises it has been a challenging time for the island’s businesses. ‘‘A lot of elderly people I would speak to on my rounds are happy that we have escaped the virus and are quite happy that we stay in lockdown. ‘‘We were able to go out for a walk and you didn’t see anybody. It was great. You would see a lot of orchids growing along the roadside. Sometimes the tourists would have picked them, which you aren’t supposed to do.‘‘But I know the businesses on the island have missed the tourists, because it’s their livelihood, so I can understand them wanting the tourists back.’’Noel believes there will be a surge in daytrippers to the island when lockdown is lted. ‘‘I think a lot of people will not necessarily want to travel abroad. The North Coast will do well out of it. I’ve no doubt we will recover.’’\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcdacefbcd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bfcdaafffbdfe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
