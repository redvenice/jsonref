Meghan Markle revealed her dreams about becoming a princess...Share this articleMarkle Sr said: \u0027I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: \u0027Daddy, I\u0027ve met a man… Daddy, he\u0027s English… Daddy, he\u0027s a prince.\u0027\u0027I thought it was a cute story. Like any father I wanted to say a few words. I was going to thank the Royal Family for welcoming my beautiful daughter into their family. But it was a speech that I was never going to be allowed to give. That hurt.\u0027He also launched a defense of his decision to speak to the media and claimed his Mail on Sunday interview would be his last – although he went on to speak to a tabloid newspaper less than 24 hours later.Speaking to The Sun on Sunday night, he added: \u0027I want to say good luck and God bless to my daughter. I don\u0027t expect to see her or hear back from her — and that\u0027s OK.\u0027All I was doing was saying things I wanted to say. I just want to re-establish the relationship with my daughter.\u0027I now want to go on vacation somewhere to try and get some peace.\u0027The latest round of interviews come just seven days after the 74-year-old spent nine hours with the Mail on Sunday, during which he admitted to a drug-taking past, said Princess Diana would have \u0027loathed\u0027 the way he is being treated and hit out at Prince Harry – saying: \u0027I don\u0027t care if Harry never speaks to me again, I\u0027ll survive.\u0027    The source accused Markle Sr of selling salacious interviews to the press, and claims he has spoken to the media more than he has tried to contact Meghan           Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha, 53, has also turned on her and has given multiple interviews slamming the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himselfHis outbursts in the press follow a series of statements made to gossip website TMZ during the period around the royal wedding in May, following the paparazzi photo scandal.Although Markle Sr had been due to attend – and had his name printed in the program – he pulled out last minute after claiming to have suffered a heart attack.Despite telling the Mail on Sunday that he spent the day in a San Diego hospital bed, Markle Sr actually watched the nuptials from a $31-a-night Airbnb in Baja Malibu – a scruffy residential compound close to his home in San Antonio del Mar.He returned home on the Monday after the wedding and was pictured purchasing a creamy drink from Starbucks en route.Since then, the retired Emmy winner has repeatedly spoken out about his daughter and has insisted that he will continue to do so until she contacts him.He has also been pictured out and about in Los Angeles, where he was spotted purchasing a McDonalds meal on his birthday last month. Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Markle Sr has been repeatedly pictured tucking into fast food – including McDonalds Happy Meals and KFC the latter shortly after he revealed he had had a heart attack.Although ex-wife Doria has remained silent about the Markle debacle currently engulfing the royal family, Meghan\u0027s half-siblings have spoken out – with sister Samantha describing the Duchess\u0027s treatment of her father as \u0027inhumane\u0027.She told the Mirror newspaper on Monday: \u0027There would be no just reason for her not to want him in her life, as he was good enough to use to make her everything she is.\u0027Samantha, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, later took to Twitter to lambaste her half-sister, describing her as \u0027heartless, arrogant and inhumane\u0027 in a series of late-night messages.The 53-year-old was echoed by her brother Thomas Markle Jr, 51, of Grants Pass, Oregon, who also slammed the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himself.He told the Mirror: \u0027It\u0027s heartbreaking to see how this has changed her and the devastation it has caused to my family.\u0027Anyone who saw Meg when she was growing up knew her and my dad were inseparable.

Presley told the court that before they married, she and Lockwood discussed having a pre-nup agreement but none was ever signed. Lisa Marie Presley is seen second from right with daughter Riley Keough, and her twin girls who she had with Lockwood (far left) in October 2017Both Presley, 50, and Lockwood, 57, signed the post-nup a year after their January 2006 wedding when Presley was worth almost $63 million and Lockwood\u0027s net worth was zero.Lockwood, wants the document torn up, calling it invalid because, he claims, he was coerced into signing it, he didn\u0027t read it properly, his lawyer at the time - who has since died - didn\u0027t explain the agreement to him, and he doesn\u0027t remember the period when the post-nup was negotiated and signed.But Presley\u0027s attorney, Gary Fishbein, has fought back in court papers filed at LA Superior Court, accusing Lockwood of \u0027feigning amnesia or ignorance\u0027 and saying he \u0027had the full and complete opportunity to negotiate the terms of the agreement, was competently represented by counsel… and entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily, without duress or coercion.\u0027 On Monday, Presley took the witness stand  and accused Lockwood, of secretly running up \u0027possibly millions\u0027 on her credit card.\u0027I uncovered that he had been in control of finances for the 10 years before,\u0027 she told Judge Dianna Gould-Saltman at Los Angeles Superior on the first day of the expected four-day trial. \u0027He had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly millions on my credit card.\u0027 When Presley angrily confronted musician Lockwood in March 2016, three months before she filed for orce, he didn\u0027t deny running up the credit card bills, she said.And she insisted that he sign an agreement consenting to sell all his guitars, recording equipment, computers and other musical equipment to help make up for some of the credit card losses. \u0027It allowed me to pay off some of the Tennessee state taxes I owed,\u0027 she added.

Did you hold a gun to his head? Did you threaten to leave him if he didn\u0027t sign?\u0027 Presley answered \u0027No\u0027 to all three questions. And when Fishbein asked her, \u0027Did he tell you that he never wanted anything from you,\u0027 she answered, \u0027Yes, he did.\u0027 When Fishbein asked her if the spousal support clause of the pre-nup - in which both she and Lockwood agreed not to seek spousal support from the other if they orced - was important to her, Presley said, \u0027Very.\u0027 Presley admitted that she did pay spousal support to her first husband, Danny Keough, when they orced but she added, with a chuckle, that she didn\u0027t have to pay support to husband number 2, Michael Jackson, or husband number 3, actor Nicholas Cage. Earlier in the day, giving his version of the couple\u0027s fight over the credit card in March 2016, Lockwood told the court that Presley \u0027was extremely upset. We were having an argument about a credit card.\u0027 He added that he agreed to sell all his musical equipment \u0027to appease her.\u0027 Asked by his lawyer, Sturman, why he signed the post-nup in 2007, Lockwood said: \u0027Because my wife wanted me to.\u0027 He said she became angry when he first hesitated to sign after his lawyer told him there were possible issues in the agreement that needed to be sorted out. But he signed anyway, he said. \u0027She\u0027s not a take-no-for-an-answer kind of woman,\u0027 he said of his soon-to-be-ex wife.Asked if he would like the court to find that the pre-nup agreement is invalid, he added, \u0027I believe it\u0027s something the court should decide.\u0027 Lockwood told the court that when he and Presley separated in June 2016, he had nowhere to go so he first stayed in a Holiday Inn, then \u0027couch-surfed\u0027 for about two years, and has been making around $2,000-$2,500 a month working as a store clerk, a factory worker, teaching guitar and playing guitar in session recordings. He said that he\u0027s now living with his girlfriend Stephanie to whom he\u0027s engaged to be married.The revelation prompted Presley\u0027s attorney to ask, \u0027Do you know that when you re-marry you would lose the spousal support from your previous marriage? Does that change your mind about getting married again?\u0027 Lockwood answered, \u0027I don\u0027t know about that.\u0027 Presley - who was in court in a black dress and beige coat and ankle boots - said she doesn\u0027t want to pay up and, countered Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman: \u0027She\u0027s feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027Earlier in his opening statement, Presley\u0027s lawyer Fishbein told Judge Gould-Saltman that he found it \u0027incredible and unbelievable\u0027 that Lockwood\u0027s \u0027position is that he didn\u0027t read the post-nuptial agreement - which he signed twice.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t need to have graduated from MIT to understand that you are waiving spousal support,\u0027 added Fishbein who also questioned Lockwood\u0027s contention that when he signed the post-nup, his attorney - now deceased - didn\u0027t explain it to him.\u0027This attorney had been practicing law since 1956 - he had more than 40 years experience in family law. \u0027Now Lockwood is trying to get out from under a agreement he voluntarily agreed to and signed. He wants a chunk of cash and a bunch of spousal support.\u0027 Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman hit back telling the court that Presley, her lawyers and business manager took an \u0027unfair advantage\u0027 of Lockwood when they persuaded him to sign the post-nup. \u0027They cooked the books - they wanted him to sign something they thought could be enforceable later on.\u0027 Despite the post-nup Sturman told the court, \u0027Spouses have a fiduciary (financial) duty to each other. \u0027Miss Presley is living off her inherited wealth….and Mr Lockwood has little or nothing. He is living at the poverty level. (Presley) is feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027 Lockwood - who wore a blue suit and tie and a black shirt in court Monday - told Fishbein under questioning that didn\u0027t remember signing the prenup. \u0027I don\u0027t really understand contracts,\u0027 he said, adding that he didn\u0027t find \u0027contracts and legalese interesting.\u0027 But, he continued: \u0027Had I read it I would not have signed it…I think it\u0027s unfair.\u0027 The trial continues. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/14/17/4F16772900000578-0-image-a-11_1534265800969.jpg","title":"Mysterious hairy sea monster beach Pacific coast Russia leaves locals baffled","story":"    Witness Svetlana Dyadenko, above, said: \u0027The most interesting thing to me is that the creature is covered with tubular fur\u0027It has \u0027no definite head or eyes\u0027 and was too heavy for locals to move, according to The Siberian Times.Speculation has ranged from a bizarre primeval relic from the deep, to an extinct woolly mammoth released from an undersea permafrost grave by the warm summer.Witness Svetlana Dyadenko posted: \u0027The most interesting thing to me is that the creature is covered with tubular fur.\u0027Could it be some ancient creature?

Here’s all you need to know about it.Munich massacre at 1972 Summer OlympicsThe Munich massacre was an attack during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany in which the Palestinian terrorist organization Black September took eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage and subsequently killed them. A West German police officer was also killed in the attack.The terrorist attack took place from approximately 4:30am local time on September 5, 1972 until about 1:30am am local time on September 6, 1972.The incident started as a hostage crisis in the early morning hours of September 5, 1972 after eight armed members of the Black September terror group infiltrated the Munich Olympic Village and used stolen keys to enter two apartments being used by the Israeli Olympic team.Some team members resisted the intrusion, ultimately leading to the deaths of two of them. Ultimately, the terror group took nine hostages, with a spokesman for them demanding the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel and Red Army Faction leaders Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader in West Germany. Black September also demanded a plane for their own escape.After debating whether to engage in negotiations with the terrorist group, West German authorities ultimately determined that a rescue attempt would be the only way to solve the crisis. They decided to feign an agreement with Black September, allowing them to transport the bound hostages to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base nearby.          Nine hostages were taken by the Black September terrorist group during the Munich massacreThe West German police decided to secretly ambush the Black September members there with snipers, but the plan suffered from poor communication, improper planning and an inadequate number of sharpshooters to eliminate all of the terrorists efficiently.At the airport, the Black September members became aware of their deception and engaged in a fierce gun battle with West German police. Despite premature media reports that the hostages had all been successfully rescued, all of them were ultimately killed in the failed rescue attempt by gunfire or grenades from Black September members.The Black September members were all killed by around 1:30am local time on September 6. However, the tragedy that resulted from the botched rescue attempt was summed up by ABC reporter Jim McKay who was covering the Summer Olympics and hostage crisis: ‘…When I was a kid, my father used to say Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears have been realized tonight. They\u0027ve now said that there were eleven hostages. Two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning, nine were killed at the airport tonight. They\u0027re all gone.’          Despite erroneous reports that the hostages were freed, all were killed during the massacreWhat was Black September?Black September was a terrorist organization founded in September 1970 as an offshoot of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.A secular nationalist terrorist group, it notoriously launched a number of other terrorist attacks during its existence in addition to the Munich attack, including assassinating Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi al-Tal in November 1971 and hijacking Sabena Flight 572 in May 1972 during its flight from Vienna to Lod, Israel.The group was ultimately disbanded by the Palestinian Liberation Organization in September 1973.Inception ending explained: Michael Caine reveals what really happened at the endTwitch plans to take on YouTube by broadening its content to expand beyond gamingNational Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, 15 AugustLuigi\u0027s \u0027death\u0027 in Smash Bros may be hint for single-player campaignEbenezer Cobb Morley honoured by Google Doodle for his 187th birthdayAmazing McDonald\u0027s hack can get you £1.99 Big Mac and fries for lifeWhat happened in the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre?Could Meghan Markle\u0027s hair reveal when she is pregnant?Aerosmith Las Vegas residency: Dates, tickets and moreWhat is Real Housewives of New York\u0027s Luann de Lesseps\u0027s net worth?Who is Cairo Dwek?

There are warnings that the hike in these guaranteed places could mean students have \u0027taken their foot off the pedal\u0027, leading to lower overall A-level results.In total, almost 68,000 of these offers have been made to 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland this year, up from less than 3,000 just five years ago.It has sparked concerns from ministers and school leaders, who say the practice undermines the university system\u0027s credibility and puts youngsters\u0027 futures at risk.There have been major changes to A-levels in England, with a move away from coursework and modular exams throughout the course.Last year the first grades were awarded in the first 13 subjects to be reformed in England. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf8701309463d57e5a0ef0a01649814245792819/650_150_3213_1928/master/3213.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e559586f105a84eb4fa4eab8c0eeccdb","title":"creatures of the cold the antarctic photography exhibition in pictures","story":"The annual exhibition, which is part of Hobart’s Antarctica festival is back on with its chilly, majestic imagery.

As temperatures rise, here are four ways to cool cities down – saving both lives and energyIf you’ve felt uncomfortably hot in a city this summer, chances are it’s not just because of the weather. Look around any urban centre and you’ll see the built environment itself exacerbates summer temperatures.Vehicles stuck in traffic emitting heat. Airconditioners pumping waste heat into the air. Concrete and asphalt across almost every surface, absorbing and radiating the sun’s rays. Urban canyons formed between tall buildings, trapping heat at the street level.All these factors contribute towards a phenomenon called the “urban heat island” effect, which results in cities being up to 10C hotter than the surrounding countryside. How do we to tackle this?A typical response on a hot day might be to turn up the aircon. But this fuels a vicious circle of heating the outdoors to cool the indoors, making external spaces more uncomfortable still, and at a significant cost. Airconditioning currently accounts for around one-fifth of building-related global electricity usage, or 2.5 timesthe total electricity use in Africa.With a warming climate and rapid population growth in hotter, increasingly wealthy countries, our use of airconditioning is set to skyrocket in what the International Energy Agency calls a “looming cold crunch”. They estimate that the energy needed for cooling buildings will triple by 2050 – a growth equivalent to the current electricity demand in the USA and Germany combined.With the frequency and intensity of heatwaves increasing we need to urgently tackle the excess heat we face both inside our buildings, and in our cities’ outside spaces. Fortunately, there are many ways in which we can mitigate the urban heat island effect – while also creating more attractive places to live, work and play.As is obvious to anyone who has sat under a tree on a hot day, vegetation can be a powerful tool in the fight against excessive city heat. Not only does greenery provide shade, it stimulates evapotranspiration, the process by which water evaporating from plants’ leaves reduces the adjacent air temperature.Many cities recognise the value of parks and trees for urban cooling, not to mention residents’ psychological wellbeing, but few have embraced greenery to the extent of Singapore. The city-state embarked on its ambitious “garden city” plan in 1967 through intensive tree-planting and the creation of new parks. As the population grew and buildings got taller, the focus shifted to include skyrise greenery encompassing “skygardens”, vertical planting and green roofs.Today Singapore accommodates 100 hectares (240 acres) of skyrise greenery, with plans to increase this to 200 ha by 2030 – an area equivalent to Regent’s Park. This growth is fuelled by building regulations such as the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (Lush) policy. Lush requires any new building to include areas of greenery equivalent to the size of the development site. These can be at ground level or at height, and often include luxuriantly planted balconies, shaded skygardens and vertical green walls – which can help cause temperatures to drop by 2-3ºC.Many new buildings go far beyond the minimum required. The Oasia Hotel, designed by WOHA Architects, accommodates greenery across virtually every surface. Wrapped in a dramatic 200m-tall planted trellis, the building almost drips with vegetation, and is wildly at odds with the corporate steel and glass of many urban structures.If we are to make cities cooler we must also change the materials they’re built from. Urban areas are dominated by dark and hard materials – concrete, asphalt, paving – most of which absorb, rather than reflect, solar radiation. According to Australia’s Corporate Research Centre for Low Carbon Living, conventional paving can reach temperatures up to 67C and conventional roofs up to 50–90C on a hot day.Such temperatures can have significant health impacts. According to Arthur Rosenfeld of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, living on the top floor of a building with a dark roof was identified as a risk factor of mortality in the 1995 heatwave in Chicago. “Government has a role to ban or phase out the use of black or dark roofs, at least in warm climates, because they pose a large negative health risk,” he said.The best way to overcome this is to use cool coatings– typically lighter pigments in asphalt or white-coloured coatings applied to roads, roofs and facades, which reflect more solar energy away from the city.The New York Cools Roofs initiative, for example, has seen more than 500,000m² of roof space covered in a white reflective coating, saving an estimated 2,282 tonnes of CO2 per year from cooling emissions. Cool roofs are installed at no cost in public buildings, for non-profit organisations and in affordable housing. In other buildings free labour for installation is offered by the city with the owner just paying for the materials.It may sound simple, but the results can be significant – research by Nasa has suggested a white roof could be 5.5C (10F) cooler than a typical black roof on the hottest day of the New York summer.Water has been used as a tool to cool cities for centuries. The 14th century palace of Alhambra, for example, housed courtyards with pools and arching fountains, stimulating the evaporation of water and cooling the hot, dry Andalusian air.The contemporary heat-proof city could follow suit, accommodating ponds, pools, fountains, sprinklers and misting systems to cool outdoor spaces.Chongqing is known as one of the “three furnaces” of the Yangtze River Delta, given its long hot summers. To provide moments of relief, the city is experimenting by using water misters at local bus stops. These spray clouds of water chilled to 5-7C, cooling the air as well as the waiting passengers.One of the challenges in keeping the built environment cool is overreliance on fully-glazed facades. Many windows permit desirable natural light and views but can mean buildings trap unwanted heat in summer and don’t retain it in winter. We can easily design shading systems to protect buildings from the sun, but for the best possible results, these shading systems need to move in tune with the local weather and the path of the sun.A building management system operates 1,049 hexagon-shaped shades, opening and closing them like flowers. Their movements follow the sun, shading the parts of the building in direct sunlight but opening up to allow for natural light as the sun moves by.The result is a constantly changing and adapting façade, one that reflects daily and seasonal patterns of weather, climate and occupation and responds to changing needs of heat and light. Adaptable buildings and infrastructure like this one, which can morph to respond to different seasons and weather events, will be crucial in the future battle to keep cool and comfortable in a warming climate.

Among other things, Lewis Goodall of Sky News sought their views on “wreathgate”, the ongoing row about the ceremony Corbyn attended in Tunis in 2014. “Everyone we spoke to agreed,” Goodall wrote afterwards. “Corbyn is being smeared, Labour does not have a problem with antisemitism and that the whole thing is largely concocted by the media and Tories.”One of the more useful phrases of our time is “tribal epistemology”, the notion that what people know is increasingly linked to the group they identify with. The wreath row has been a case in point. There is no single, agreed set of facts on which the various sides hold different opinions. Instead, among those most heatedly involved, the facts or evidence people see and don’t see depend on their tribal or factional affiliation.Jeremy Corbyn has said that he was present but not involved at a wreath-laying for people behind the group that carried out the Munich Olympics massacre.The row centres on a wreath-laying event in Tunisia for two separate groups, both the victims of a 1985 Israeli airstrike in Tunis and for the Palestinian leaders linked to the Black September terror group who killed Israeli athletes.There are memorials to the victims of the 1985 bombing and a four graves for leading figures from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, thought to have been behind the Black September group, in different parts of the cemetery.Corbyn was attending a conference in Tunisia called the International Conference on Monitoring the Palestinian Political and Legal Situation in the Light of Israeli Aggression.In an article for the Morning Star in 2014, shortly after his visit, Corbyn said he was present for a ceremony honouring the 1985 victims and “others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991”.The Palestine Liberation Organisation’s intelligence chief Atef Bseiso – who has been accused of involvement in the Munich Olympics massacre – was killed in Paris in 1992, purportedly by Mossad. No-one was killed in Paris in 1991, so Corbyn may just have got the wrong date.On Saturday, the Daily Mail published pictures of Corbyn holding a wreath at the Palestinian Martyrs’ Cemetery in Tunisia.The paper said that its own visit to the cemetery had shown that the memorial for the victims of the 1985 bombing was 15 yards away from the spot where Corbyn was pictured holding a wreath.The story claims the pictures were taken in front of a plaque honouring the founder of the Black September and yards from the grave of Bseiso.Corbyn said that “a wreath was indeed laid” for “some of those who were killed in Paris in 1992” and added, in response to a question: “I was present at that wreath-laying, I don’t think I was actually involved in it.”He added: “I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere.Labour has said that Corbyn had already made clear he was paying his respects to the victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis. But Corbyn’s remarks indicate he was at least aware of another wreath-laying at the memorial event.Which is how a set of photographs from a Tunis cemetery has become the object of such controversy. Neutrals are probably either confused by the whole business and tune out, or they tend towards the view of that crowd in Stoke: that the media have falsely trashed Corbyn in the past – witness the baseless Czech spy accusation – and therefore are not to be taken too seriously now.For those reasons, Corbyn and Labour will surely ride out this current storm. Nevertheless, rows like this one are not good for the party: they take up time and energy that might otherwise be devoted to opposing the government or advancing Labour’s own programme. How then should Labour deal with this argument and others like it which, if the past is any guide, are likely to keep on coming?On the Tunis episode, there are three options. The first is to say that everything that happened, every wreath that was laid, was solely in honour of those killed in the 1985 Israeli bombing of PLO headquarters in Tunis. That was the line taken by the pro-Corbyn MP Chris Williamson as he toured BBC studios on Tuesday, and enthusiastically echoed by Corbyn supporters online. Its great strength is that deploring the 1985 bombing is not controversial: even Margaret Thatcher did it.But there are two problems with the “1985-only” line. For one thing, the photographs clearly show two distinct wreath-laying moments: one at the 1985 memorial, with Jeremy Corbyn hovering at the back, and another at a visibly different location, by the graves of senior PLO leaders reputedly involved in the 1970s with the Black September faction, which organised the massacre and torture of Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich in 1972. The men buried there had no connection with 1985, and it’s in that location that Corbyn is pictured holding a wreath.What’s more, Corbyn himself explicitly wrote, in the Morning Star after the Tunis trip, that 1985 was not the sole focus of the ceremonies: “Wreaths were laid at the graves of those who died on that day and on the graves of others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991.” So the photographs and Corbyn’s own words make the 1985-only line unsustainable.The second approach available to Corbyn would be to say that he has long been a devoted supporter of the Palestinians and on that day in 2014 he was not going to get too hung up on the exact details of this plaque or that grave, which were anyway opaque to him as a non-speaker of Arabic: what mattered was standing in solidarity with his Palestinian friends. But perhaps he worries that would sound insufficiently discerning for a would-be prime minister.The third option would be to say: “Yes, as the photographs show, I did lay a wreath at the graves of Salah Khalaf, known as Abu Iyad, along with Hayel Abdel-Hamid and Fakhri al Omari. I knew exactly who they were and I make no apology for that.” The argument the Labour leader could make would be that perhaps those men were leaders of the group behind the murderous Munich attack, but they changed course: Khalaf became one of the prime proponents of the PLO’s shift away from violence and towards diplomacy. Corbyn could say that it was precisely that journey that he was honouring that day in Tunis.The trouble is, if that had indeed been Corbyn’s motivation he would surely have mentioned it in that Morning Star article or since. Instead he has left the impression that he is a bit vague about who these men were. He wrote that they were killed in Paris, when in fact it was Tunis. He said they were killed by Mossad agents, when in fact they were killed by a rival Palestinian faction. (It’s possible Corbyn was confusing those three with a fourth man, Atef Bsesio, also allegedly linked to Munich and also buried in that same cemetery: he was reportedly killed by Mossad agents in Paris – though that was in 1992, not 1991.)The point is, there is a way to deal with these questions which, given Corbyn’s record of activism, will keep coming. It will require precision and candour, rather than I-didn’t-inhale formulations such as “I was present but not involved”, especially when the pictures say otherwise.Chiefly, it will mean honestly admitting that when he attended events like this one – and this goes for his history in Northern Ireland too – he was not there as some neutral peace broker, as he now suggests, but as a vocal supporter of one side against the other. He was not an intermediary in either IsraelPalestine or Northern Ireland: if he had been, he would have been scrupulous about meeting all sides, which he never did, and expressing either no solidarity with any side or plenty with all of them, which was also not his way.Instead, in IsraelPalestine his position was not that of a healing conciliator of two warring peoples, but rather “to eradicate Zionism”, to cite the stated goal of the Labour Movement Campaign for Palestine of which he was a sponsor. In Northern Ireland, he was for republicanism and against unionism, taking part for example in a 1987 ceremony to honour not all victims of terrorism, but eight IRA gunmen killed by the SAS. As he put it at the time: “I’m happy to commemorate all those who died fighting for an independent Ireland.”In these conflicts, Corbyn did not sit on the fence or act as some even-handed negotiator. He chose sides. That’s what makes him who he is it’s what many people admire about him. To his most loyal supporters he can perhaps pretend that he spent decades as some kind of unofficial UN peace envoy. But for everyone else, he needs to have an honest, precise reckoning with his past. Otherwise, what happened this week will keep happening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cbb044e1b2c05dc50e1337570bae502edc005a6/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79371a96ed1613c01e5152bb48addeb9","title":"second brexit referendum fantasy peoples vote","story":"Support is growing for a People’s Vote. It could backfire spectacularlyAt every turn, the politics of the Brexit process have been riddled with disastrous illusions: the referendum would settle the issue once and for all leaving would mean a cash harvest for the NHS an early general election would give the government a mandate no deal would be better than a bad deal as Brexit neared, the country would come together.It was all wishful thinking, as most illusions are. We are now up to our collective necks in the consequences. Most of the wishfulness was on the side of the leavers and of the two most recent Conservative leaders. Now, though, it is the remainers who have to ask themselves whether they, in their turn, are not falling for another Brexit illusion – this time in the shape of a second referendum, or the so-called People’s Vote.Theresa May has always brushed aside the second referendum proposal. It is the concession she can never allow. It would mean that Brexit might not mean Brexit after all. It will not happen “in any circumstances”, says Downing Street. But in fact there are circumstances in which it might.It has always been clear, politically speaking, that only a second referendum could undo the first. It is the only democratic way. That is why May cannot allow that possibility. Yet the advance of the second referendum option up the political agenda is real and inexorable. There is now a clear majority, according to the opinion polls, for a referendum on the terms of a future EU deal. There is also now a majority against Brexit. If the Brexit negotiations get even more bogged down, these majorities can be expected to grow. The argument that the politicians have failed to sort things out, and so the people must decide, will get louder – and will have a certain logic.One reason for this is that Labour seems to be moving towards embracing the second referendum idea. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has said it is a possibility. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has refused to rule it out. Now, perhaps crucially, there has been a significant shift from leave to remain since 2016 among voters in 100 Labour leave constituencies, including McDonnell’s. As the polling analyst Peter Kellner pointed out, this reduces the risk of a leave backlash in Labour heartlands. It could be a game-changer.What is more, the issue is certain to come up in parliament this autumn. The first likely opportunity will be when MPs debate their “meaningful vote” motion, possibly in November. But there will then be a second opportunity, when parliament scrutinises the promised withdrawal agreement and implementation bill. If the government did a U-turn on May’s opposition to a fresh vote, a second referendum would get a majority, though it would split the Conservatives. Even if the government stuck to its opposition, there might be enough Tory remainer rebels to help carry a second vote amendment.Let’s assume, though, that Britain decides to hold a second referendum. This is nowhere close to being an end to the matter. In fact there is both an underlying problem – and a whole heap of practical ones. The underlying problem is that Britain has never satisfactorily sorted out whether or how referendums can coexist with our system of representative democracy. The last two years have been an object lesson in the seriousness of this. Last month an independent commission on referendums, commissioned by University College London’s constitution unit, argued that it must be sorted out. But it won’t be. There just isn’t time. The second referendum would trigger a whole set of problems of its own, whatever the result.Now consider some practical problems. The first of these is time. Brexit is scheduled to take place on 29 March next year. Almost certainly, all 27 remaining EU states would have to agree to extend the article 50 process beyond then. That can’t happen overnight. Parliament would also need time. Referendums need legislation. Legislation can be amended. The bill would certainly not be nodded through. The Electoral Commission and the local authorities that must run the poll need time to draw up rules – and these need to work far better than in 2016. Yet the bill for the 2016 referendum was introduced 13 months before polling day. This vote would have to be in spring 2019. We’re looking at – perhaps – three months max.None of this is impossible, although all of it is difficult. In 2015 Greece managed to conduct a nationwide referendum on its IMF bailout terms a mere eight days after the poll was announced. So the British timetable could doubtless be compressed too. But the more it is compressed, the more the legitimacy issue will be in question. Even the Greek referendum of 2015 had to survive a court challenge.Then there is the question of the question. What would the referendum ask? The 2019 vote would presumably be a vote on the deal, since that is what People’s Vote campaigners are pressing for. A yesno vote on the deal would be straightforward if the result were yes, but chaotic to interpret if it were no – with angry leavers and remainers combining to defeat the deal. Maybe that chaos is the price Britain must pay in order to avoid Brexit. But it is to avoid this that Justine Greening, May’s former education secretary, and others have proposed a three-option vote – accept, reject and remain, or crash out – with a preferential voting system. Others have floated the idea of a two-stage referendum.Britain needs the chance to rescue itself from the decision it took in 2016. We can do so much better than that. So, if this is the only way to stop Brexit in a democratic manner, then let us do it. But let’s not kid ourselves: the whole thing is riddled with risk and uncertainty, the politics are treacherous, and the consequences could be as complex and difficult as the consequences of the first vote have proved to be.When the time is right, we need a second vote, but without illusions – for we will be messing with an already deeply troubled country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5b3140e922d57f6b6eb1d26f65918e9503e40f7/0_8_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?w=465\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5331352a1464552c6e721df3e92bc422 930w","title":"young people more sceptical about value of university poll","story":"With 26,000 places unfilled on A-level results day, research reveals drop in number of pupils with college ambitions Young people are becoming more sceptical about the benefits of going to university, despite a large majority saying they want to carry on to higher education, research suggests.The findings coincide with the publication on Thursday of A-level and BTec level three grades for hundreds of thousands of sixth formers.

Its founder, Sir Peter Lampl, said it was no surprise to see the fall in enthusiasm tempered by the realities of being a student.“Young people face a dilemma,” he said. “If they go on to university they incur debts of over £50,000 and will be paying back their loans well into middle age. And in a number of cases they end up with degrees that don’t get them into graduate jobs.“On the other hand, degree-level apprenticeships are almost non-existent, with fewer than 10,000 available each year compared with over 300,000 university places. There is effectively no viable alternative to university.”The polling found that those from the least well-off families in England and Wales were the most worried about the cost of studying. The Sutton Trust wants the government to restore maintenance grants and consider means-testing tuition fees to reflect the financial circumstances of young people.Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of industry body Universities UK, said that demand for university places was at record levels among school-leavers. “A university education is an excellent investment which can have a transformational impact through the skills and experiences graduates acquire,” Jarvis said.For most sixth formers their immediate concerns would be their exam results, with particular interest in England, where students will be sitting the latest tranche of reformed A-levels in subjects including religious studies, modern languages and geography.The last batch of reformed subjects – in which grades would in most cases rely on final exam marks rather than continuous assessment – follow the 13 that were sat for the first time last year, as part of a drive by the government to make the qualifications more challenging.“The new qualifications remain of the same high standard as the ones they replaced and have been updated with input from universities,” said Sally Collier, the head of England’s exam regulator Ofqual. “They have more effective assessment arrangements and also allow additional time for study.“Against this backdrop of change, it is pleasing that the exam series has gone smoothly and that standards have been maintained. Students, schools and colleges should be congratulated on their achievements.”Ofqual has said that overall the proportion of grades awarded would be little changed from previous years despite the change in exam formats, which have seen AS-level results excluded. The proportion of grades awarded has been set using the prior attainment of pupils taking exams in each subject, based on their GCSE grades.However, Collier has warned that the distribution of grades may change, with schools likely to see some volatility compared with previous years. Boys may also improve their performance relative to girls’ for the second year in a row, with boys thought likely to do better in exam-based assessments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52db1b3ba271222d7dd04a040d36abb5ff708abc/0_0_900_540/master/900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e3686bb80dfdceff3ac9f47b095d491","title":"nutria california rodents wetlands environment","story":"As the dog-sized creatures destroy wetlands and dig through levees, officials have a goal: total exterminationThe call came from a wildlife trapper working in the wetlands of central California.“I think I caught a nutria,” the man said.A year and a half later, Gerstenberg strode up to his waist into the sludgey wetlands, pulling a kayak through mats of green slime and the methane stink of decomposing plant matter. He checked dozens of traps piled with tempting watermelon slices and sweet potatoes. His .22 rifle was on his truck, ready.The name “nutria” evokes something you’d find in a health food store, but in fact they are dog-sized invasive rodents with curved orange incisors that have decimated marshes and swamps worldwide and have, worryingly and mysteriously, appeared in California, perhaps 500 miles from the nearest known population in Oregon. Gerstenberg’s goal: total extermination.Although nutria are native to South America, since the 19th and early-20th centuries they have been raised in North America, Europe and Asia by those who wanted to create a market for their glossy brown fur. “It’s just like a mink coat – gorgeous,” the nutria expert Gary Witmer, a biologist at the National Wildlife Research Center, said.But fur is out of fashion, and escaped or released nutria have proven voracious. A nutria can consume a quarter of its body weight in plant material per day, chowing through the vegetation that holds wetlands together and burrowing through levees meant to prevent flooding. In Louisiana, it has been reported that nutria have converted more than 40 square miles of marshland to open water since 2000. To make matters worse, they are prodigiously fertile. Females can have litters three times a year, producing five or six pups each time.Gerstenberg said it was hard to fathom why anyone would purposely introduce them to California. Some have hypothesized that a landowner wanted them to keep water hyacinth down, or that they were unwanted pets. “They’re kinda cute when they’re small,” he said. “But they don’t stay small.”When the carcass of the first nutria was delivered to Gerstenberg, he found that it was a pregnant female, indicating it was not alone. Six weeks later, wildlife cameras provided proof of this. Gerstenberg was one of those put in charge of heading the response, though he says he is critically underfunded and can only rely on a team of six loaned staffers in the field.Driving to a pond near the town of Los Banos, 120 miles south-east of San Francisco, he saw distant smoke billowing from the Ferguson fire, near Yosemite national park, on the horizon, and noted that it was being tackled by 3,000 firefighters. “When you compare it, that’s gonna be out in a couple weeks, it’ll be nothing. This is something – if we don’t deal with it now, it’s gonna keep growing.”So far, more than 200 have been eliminated. Gerstenberg anticipates bringing in sniffer dogs to hunt the animals. And he wants to deploy “Judas nutria” – sterilized nutria fitted with radio collars that researchers hope will lead them to unlucky stragglers they might have missed.An astonishing 1.8 million nutria pelts were produced in the state in 1976. But their wholesale destruction of wetlands has prompted the state to offer private hunters a bounty, currently $5 for at least 7in of severed tail. In the 2016-17 season, they killed 216,000 of them. The state has also tried other methods of stemming their numbers, for instance by promoting them as a culinary delicacy.“I think they were calling them ‘swamp rabbits’ because they didn’t wanna call them rodents,” said Witmer, the nutria expert. “It just didn’t go over with people and died down pretty quickly.”(Witmer had some nutria meat in his own freezer for a few years. “Maybe I was afraid to eat it or maybe I overlooked it, who knows,” he said. “They say it tastes like chicken, because that’s what people say about anything.”)Arthuer Matherne, an airboat tour operator in the south- eastern Louisiana town of Des Allemands, has a message for California: a nutria problem can rapidly spiral.When he started hunting them for the bounty, 15 years ago, he bagged 6,800 in just 15 days. “Just riding around with a .22 and shooting ’em,” he said. “An easy buck, and fun doing it.” He used to sell the fur to clothing companies and the meat to alligator farms, though now their numbers have fallen in his area.“Everybody been after them and they knocked the population off pretty good,” Matherne said. “But it won’t take long for them to come back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72702b16786297d4130317692af41ba2fabd7cd6/0_0_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea313a8ec4a5e00c03a296caa8bbfaa","title":"chris pine star trek films captain kirk jesse plemons","story":"Risking the cast’s chemistry by hiring a new Captain Kirk may be boldly going way too farThere are moments in USS Callister, the 2017 Black Mirror episode that riffs furiously on Star Trek and gamer geekery, that might tempt us to wonder if the makers of the new series of films (starring Chris Pine as Captain Kirk) might have considered Jesse Plemons for the role instead. For while Pine has charisma in spades and a confident twinkle in the eye that recalls William Shatner at his best, Plemons is rather better at nailing the Canadian actor’s habit of slipping into knowing, smug braggadocio when the Klingons have been defeated for the umpteenth time.Casting the star of Breaking Bad and Fargo as James T might be a little like the makers of James Bond deciding to hire Johnny English’s Rowan Atkinson as the new 007. But far worse casting decisions have been made in the halls of Hollywood over the decades – let’s hope we shouldn’t be girding our loins for another now that Pine has been revealed to be in a pay dispute with Paramount Pictures about his future in Star Trek.The Hollywood Reporter says the Wonder Woman actor has in effect been asked to take a pay cut, owing to the middling performance of 2016’s Star Trek Beyond, which made just $343.5m (£271m) worldwide against a production budget of $185m (which, due to the eternally eccentric accountancy practices of Hollywood studios, means it probably lost money). Also in dispute is Chris Hemsworth, who was expected to reprise his role as George Kirk (James’s dear old supposedly dead dad) in Star Trek IV.The original article states, somewhat bemusingly, that Pine’s comrades on the Starship Enterprise are at least, pretty much to the last member, signed up for the next episode. But Star Trek wouldn’t be Star Trek without Captain Kirk, and there would not be much point in his crewmates setting off on the next stage in their bold adventure into space without him. There are only so many times we can chuckle at Spock’s awkward attempts at romance with Zoe Saldana’s Uhura, or witness Simon Pegg’s Scotty snatching geeky victory from the jaws of defeat.Nor is bringing in another actor to play Kirk really an option here. When Pine pulled on Shatner’s yellow blazer for the first time, in 2009’s Star Trek, it was to mark the reintroduction of the long-running space saga to the big screen in a fresh timeline and new actors taking the key roles. The only returnee from the Original Series cast was the late Leonard Nimoy, in an extended, wonderfully elegant cameo as the time-travelling “Spock Prime”. To now hire a new actor to play Kirk, while keeping all other crew members of the Enterprise in their current roles, would be to risk losing the abundant chemistry between Pine, Karl Urban’s Bones and Zachary Quinto’s Spock. And Star Trek, perhaps more than any other sci-fi series, is all about the chemistry between its key cast members.We have to believe these guys have spent years in each other’s company, through exciting adventures and tedious trawls through the furthest reaches of space alike. The series would almost do better to kill off Kirk and reboot with a new crew, just as it has done umpteen times on the small screen. Hardcore Trekkies would probably cheer such a move, given the distaste many display towards the new films.Paramount may have a point about the budget. The Star Trek movies do not make the kind of money Marvel or Star Wars films routinely pull in at the global box office. But they are well-reviewed action tentpoles that most studios would be desperate to have on their slate. The danger here is that the current impasse ends up proving a false economy for the bigwigs – an unwinnable battle as ultimately self-defeating as the saga’s famous Kobayashi Maru test. The Enterprise might well eventually continue its famous five-year mission, after her destruction and bravura climactic reconstruction in Beyond. But without her captain to guide her, will she ever fly so true again?The sidelining of Plemons’ horrid Captain Robert Daly in USS Callister was the catalyst for his captive crewmates’ escape into a wider digital universe of geeky sci-fi adventure in the Netflix series. Deposing Pine from the Star Trek hot seat seems highly unlikely to deliver the same rewards.

No one took us out from school and marched us about to say ‘this happened here’, which is remarkable.”Manchester Histories, a charity, is leading the campaign for Peterloo to be taught in all schools. It has applied for money from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help schools teach about the attack, and it is developing a dedicated website and walking app on the subject and training a cohort of volunteers to become “Peterloo ninjas”.There is no explicit mention of Peterloo on the national curriculum, though the Department for Education said teachers were free to teach it if they wanted.Leigh said he saw parallels between England then and the country of today. “In the end, why is the film still relevant? Many reasons. One of them being the difference between those who have and those who don’t have. Those who have power and those who don’t. Those who have wealth and those who are on the breadline.”At the time of the massacre, the London-based government was ignorant of life outside the capital, said Leigh. The then home secretary, Henry Addington, who oversaw the ruthless crackdown on dissent that reached its bloody nadir at Peterloo, had never been to the north, Leigh discovered during his four years of research.The government saw those agitating in the north as “terrorists who had to be put down”, said Leigh. “But we know that these were people with a legitimate cause. Some of them were moderate and some of them more extreme.”The biggest problem Leigh had when shooting the £14m film was that Manchester had changed so much in the two centuries since Peterloo.“When we embarked on it, I said obviously we are going to shoot it in Manchester. Well, not a single frame of it is filmed in Manchester,” said Leigh, who shot the massacre scenes in Tilbury, Essex.The site of the battle is now unrecognisable, occupied by tooting trams, Manchester’s central library and the Midland hotel.Though Peterloo was filmed outside of the city, Manchester is to host its UK premiere, after the BFI London film festival decided to show a competition film outside of the capital for the first time in its 62-year history.•Peterloo screens on 17 October at Manchester’s Home, followed by a Q\u0026ampA with the director and cast that will be simulcast to cinemas around the UK.

As common as a floral print, yet not nearly as genteel, they are the quickest way to turn the wearer into a massive advert. In the last few years, they have been found a new home on all sorts of incongruous non-fashion items. Some of these have made commercial sense, such as logo lighters. Similarly, to an extent, Tom Ford made sex cool again in a 2003 advert when he shaved the Gucci emblem into a model’s topiary.Then there’s food and, in this instance, an ice-cream lolly with the Italian label Fendi’s double F logo stamped on one side – hilariously implying that a significant number of fashion people actually eat.As someone who works in fashion yet occasionally eats, I felt compelled to try one. The Fendi ice-cream can be bought throughout August from Selfridges and was devised in collaboration with ice-cream specialists Steccolecco, whose branch in Prati, Rome, is populated by local cinema-goers who tend to eat theirs before watching trailers. Each ice-cream costs £4 and there is no plastic wrapper – instead, you get a little paper napkin wrapped around the stick to catch drips, as per tradition. The new lollies – some creamy, some icy – are part of a Fendi pop-up that sells, among other things, Fendi supermarket shopping baskets, yours for a tidy grand, and £600 T-shirts. There are 12 flavours, including mango and passion fruit, although the most popular flavour is hazelnut. When the air turns soupy, it’s lemon. The obvious choice, though, is granny’s cream, an unvarnished translation from the Italian “crema di nonna”, which is a sort of frozen custard. On one side, the double F logo is stamped with an edible dye in dark brown – some of the lollies just have a Fendi-stamped stick – so for the two minutes it takes to eat it you can parade your wares by licking the other side. If Fendi bags are built to last, the aim of this lolly is perhaps the joy of destroying its value.I have eaten ice-cream more than anything else for this column, such are the ways people like to repackage it. Unstable, savoury, creamy nonsense a lot of the time. This, though, is proper, artisanal stuff – like a Wall’s Mini Milk but made from the cream of pampered cows from San Bartolomeo. It makes me nostalgic for sand, holidays and parts of Europe we will soon talk about with some distance.It is worth noting that fans of minimalism do not shop at Fendi. At the most recent show, which took place in Milan last June, there weren’t just logos. There were logos on top of logos. There were logos on bags, of which some models carried three. No fabric escaped unstamped, such is the logic of Fendi. So, while you may see a posh lolly, Fendi simply sees a blank surface, waiting to be filled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28a71cfed6ae4d1898dfc12aeb04a77048ad094d/39_139_2666_1600/master/2666.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b1e0fef31e619988b2cbcf951e98742","title":"aleksandar mitrovic fulham premier league return","story":"The Serbian endured a tough time against Crystal Palace last Saturday but he remains excited about helping the west London side re-establish themselves in the Premier LeagueMitrovic has not set himself a goalscoring target for this season. “I never say I want to score 15 or 20 goals.” Instead, he says, he concentrates on making an effective contribution to the team, anticipating that if they do well the goals will follow. “Of course a striker wants to score as much as possible, it’s nice scoring goals, goals are like an addiction when you score you want to keep doing more and more,” he adds. “But my target is to play and to help the team, to do my job as best as I can. I say that if the team play well and use me in the right way… the goals will come.”Worth noting in those remarks is the phrase ‘use me in the right way’. Mitrovic joined Fulham this summer for a club record £22m after an outstanding loan spell in the Championship last season. The 23-year-old striker scored 12 goals in 17 appearances as Fulham went through the gears on the way to winning the play-offs. Watching Mitrovic thrive in this Fulham team would have come as a surprise to anyone who had seen the striker struggle during his time at Newcastle United where the Serbian forward cut a forlorn figure, standing stock still on the last man waiting for a cross that he could put his head to.Is this the first time Mitrovic has been at a club willing to play to his strengths? “To be honest the answer is yes”, he says. “I had that time in Belgium with Anderlecht, but this is the first time in England that I feel really comfortable in the system and in the way we play.“I think the manager and my team-mates ... they all know my strengths and try to use them in the best way that they can. They play high with a lot of crosses, a lot of players around me, always around the box. I feel really comfortable in this combination and I think this is the reason I had a really good time last season.”There is no doubt that in his fellow Serb Slavisa Jokanovic, Mitrovic has a manager who understands his abilities and wants to make best use of them. But Jokanovic also appears to have helped the striker develop as a man. When he arrived in England at the age of 20, Mitrovic had a reputation as a bad boy. When he turned 21 he was averaging a booking every three and a half games. Last season, at club level, he earned just three yellow cards all year.When listening to him speak, Mitrovic seems a mature inidual thoughtful when responding to questions and with a good command of English. When he says it is a long season ahead for Fulham, he means not only that the challenge will be hard but that there will be opportunity to improve.“I’m always looking forward and I try to continue to push myself and to do the best that I can”, Mitrovic says. “I had an amazing four months last year in the Championship and of course I want to continue this in the Premier League. I know it’s going to be hard, it’s a better league with much more quality but I know I have abilities, I have quality and of course I want to show everybody that I can play in the best league in the world, that’s normal.“I say again: I want to score goals, I want to play, but the first thing is that this team is winning games and making good results. If the team plays well, the goals will come for sure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa62d922cd9285c806ac2bd13b3994ded260c05/0_213_3943_2367/master/3943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b384db650c36a65e7ba83f308766cee4","title":"barcelona la masia messi xavi iniesta","story":"The dimly lit, studiously grey lecture room carries the feel of a sixth-form block in a suburban high-school. On the opposite side of the street, about the width of a football pitch away, stands a typical Aldi supermarket, intensifying the acute sense of suburban normality. But this is no conventional school environment.This is the heart of La Masia 2.0, Barcelona’s modern incarnation of the famous residential farmhouse that helped nurture the finest generation of footballers the club has ever seen. The place where Lionel Messi, Xavi Hernández, Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta and the rest of the tiki-taka brigade were schooled in the art of strangling the opposition with relentlessly mesmeric ball-hogging manoeuvres.“It’s not luck but we had a lot of stars at the same time,” explains Marc Carmona, Barcelona’s head of coach education. “The Spain team won three consecutive tournaments between 2008 and 2012 – and it coincided with Barça’s best period in history.”Sitting in La Masia’s main lecture hall a couple of days after Spain got their chaotic World Cup bid off to a stuttering start with a 3-3 draw against Portugal, Carmona goes on to explain that one of the high points for La Masia, founded in 1979 at the insistence of Johan Cruyff, came in 2010. An astonishing nine La Masia graduates dominated the Spain squad that made history by winning a first World Cup. Two of those players – Xavi and Iniesta – joined another La Masia graduate, a certain diminutive Argentinian, on the Ballon d’Or shortlist the same year.It was the first and only time all three players on the shortlist have hailed from the same club. Messi won it – his second of five so far – and, remarkably, the club has had at least one player on the final shortlist every year since 2004. “We are working to repeat this period,” says Carmona. “But it’s very difficult.”This difficulty has become clear in recent years. Just 12 months after La Masia 2.0 opened in 2011, Tito Villanova made history by fielding a starting 11 comprising all La Masia graduates. But since then only Sergio Roberto has established himself in the first team after coming through the ranks.A little over two years ago, the club introduced La Masia 360, an attempt to widen the net to produce the next wave of superstar players as the game evolves but also with a nod to the legion of players who might not make it to the top. The club now extends the holistic approach to developing its residential players, currently 76 youngsters, to include the 550 or so other players within the academy programme across five professional sports: football (male and female), basketball, futsal, handball and roller hockey.“For about 70 youth players, they live here, sleep here, eat here, study here, train here. They have a lot of attention,” says Carmona. “One day the strategy department decided that if we take care of these 70 young athletes in all ways, why are Barça not giving this same attention to all the youth professional players? So now, we are trying to give the same attention for the non-residents. They don’t live here but we are trying to control their family situation, their study situation too.”The club’s commitment to its Mes que un club philosophy is clear. The 360 programme focuses on the whole child and is up front about the psycho-social characteristics required to make it at Barça: humility, effort, ambition, respect, teamwork.“For us behaviour is very important. You have to win by respecting the opponent, the referee and the rules of the play,” says Carmona. “But also by respecting our three big treasures in football, the three Ps: possession of the ball, position of the ball and pressing after losing the ball. This is our way to understand football. This is clear from watching any Barcelona game.”The five-storey building – full name La Masia Centre de formacio Oriol Tort – is situated in the heart of the club’s suburban training complex, Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper, about three miles east of Camp Nou. It replaced the famous old farmhouse as the central nervous system of the FC Barcelona behemoth.The rear end of the ground-floor corridor leads to the restaurant before a door paves the way to an outdoor playground that rams home the focus on learning and play: next to a table-football table stands an oversize table-tennis table, which is oval, carries football pitch markings and lends itself to 2v2 games (table tennis and head tennis) between the players. “It’s just like you see in the public parks of Barcelona,” says Carmona.Real Madrid’s €100m investment in its academy set-up, not to mention its first team’s recent dominance in Europe, raises the difficult question of whether modern football is leaving Barça’s purism behind. Carmona is quick to defend the clear thread of playing style and philosophy that runs through the age groups at La Masia, from the Under-10s right up to the first team.“During the season, you can see the training session for the U10, then the U16 then Barça B and you will see the same,” he says. “Different exercises because of the age of the players but the idea of the session, and the kind of exercises, are very similar. You can smell it, you can see it in the session this is our DNA.“It is about games in a small space, a lot of rondos, a lot of games with possession, a lot of games 4v4, 5v5, so you can see that the ball is very important. To pass the ball, control the ball, to move with the ball … this is the DNA in football. And the coaches are trying to transmit the understanding at all ages.”Carmona was the hugely successful head coach of Barcelona’s futsal team before he took on the role of ensuring all the club’s youth coaches are tuned into the Barça DNA. The benefits of futsal – the Fifa-sanctioned version of five a side – have been long espoused by Messi, Xavi and Iniesta among many others. It is clear Barcelona is also trying to succeed by nurturing football’s little brother too. “In futsal you touch the ball more, participate a lot, are in contact with the ball a lot,” Carmona says. “Sometimes in football you can touch the ball once every three minutes. It is a very good practice for football to play futsal.”Jordi Torras, a former Barcelona and Spain futsal star who is now head of youth futsal coaching at the club, explains how the match-realistic scenarios are crucial given the importance of the tournament to come. “At this stage of the championship we will work more on the strategic aspects and a lot of real situations that you can find with the rival and the match,” he says. “The philosophy is the same as the one requested by the club: we have to win by being an example in everything and that is what makes us different.”As well the residencies at its training ground, Barcelona’s clear commitment to a professional futsal team is another marker of difference between them and Real.

Even though Pep Guardiola has more squad depth than most, the midfielder’s absence caused comment and his creative input was missed, which is probably why he was sent on for the last half-hour.City have players who can do a similar job, most notably David Silva and Ilkay Gündogan, though De Bruyne is the player who brings the best out of his teammates and an absence of more than a few weeks would adversely affect their title defence.“Kevin is a great player and it’s just unfortunate that it’s happened to him in training but there’s more than enough depth in the squad,” said the defender Kyle Walker. “We don’t just rely on one player. It’s a team game and whoever steps in will do well. Obviously it’s a big loss but we’ve got more than enough cover.”So influential was De Bruyne in City’s title campaign last season that he would most likely have been voted player of the season but for Mohamed Salah’s remarkable run of goals and performances that helped to carry Liverpool into the Champions League final.With the transfer window already closed, losing their most gifted and versatile attacking performer for any length of time would be a blow to Guardiola and his team, though even if it were still possible to bring in a replacement City would have struggled to identify a player of the requisite quality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3949bba4c0a0dac09767b5cc818d2b2ea48c9dd6/0_52_2147_1288/master/2147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3a5358aa29ccc3cdfe12f5d4e372463","title":"not weekend for premier league underdog football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Archie Rhind-Tutt and Mark Langdon to review the first Premier League weekend of the season, Liverpool’s impressive start, same old Arsenal (or is it?), Luke Shaw’s release from wherever José Mourinho was hiding him and a foul from BurundiRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Le Coq Arena in Tallinn.With the La Liga season set to start at the weekend, playing 120 minutes in a venue located more than 2,400 miles from the Spanish capital was not ideal for either club.Real’s new manager, Julen Lopetegui, endured a nightmare start as the European champions fell behind inside a minute to a superb inidual goal from Costa. The Spain striker chased his own flick on following Diego Godín’s ball forward, held off the challenges of Ramos and Raphaël Varane and then smashed the ball past Keylor Navas at the near post from a tight angle.Navas should have done better and he probably would not have started the match had the new £31.5m signing Thibaut Courtois, who was watching from the stands, been registered to play.Having not signed a replacement for Ronaldo, Lopetegui opted to select Gareth Bale in a three-pronged attack with Benzema and Marco Asensio. Bale, who scored the match-winning goals in May’s Champions League final as a substitute, created the leveller in the 27th minute. The Wales forward burst down the right past Lucas Hernández and delivered a perfect cross for Benzema to head past Jan Oblak at the far post.The Atlético coach, Diego Simeone, was forced to watch from the stands while serving the third match of a four-game touchline ban after insulting a match official during last season’s Europa League semi-final against Arsenal. He withdrew the World Cup winner Antoine Griezmann with 57 minutes played and saw his team fall behind six minutes later.Juanfran, under pressure from Benzema, was penalised for handball by the Polish referee Szymon Marciniak and Ramos coolly converted the resultant spot-kick, rolling the ball into the bottom right corner and sending Oblak the wrong way.Atlético had never previously beaten their city rivals in a final but they responded with an equaliser 11 minutes from time. Juanfran atoned for his earlier error by playing in Griezmann’s replacement Ángel Correa and the substitute cut the ball back for Costa to tap home.Saúl put Atlético back in front eight minutes into the additional period, smashing a volley into the top right corner following a cross from the substitute Thomas Partey.Real never conceded four goals in a match under Lopetegui’s predecessor Zinedine Zidane and were aiming to win the trophy for the third successive season. But any hopes of a fightback were extinguished in the 104th minute when midfielder Koke slotted home for the Europa League holders to give Simeone his seventh trophy as Atlético manager."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89de8145882b7c7572295e2acf401d470cc1acfc/1239_157_2196_1318/master/2196.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83886f8b9dbc5f28a8d9de3ee56c318c","title":"cps defends handling of case against cricketer ben stokes","story":"Prosecution criticised for trying to add assault charge to indictment in trial in which Stokes was clearedThe Crown Prosecution Service has defended its handling of the high-profile case against the England cricketer Ben Stokes after a jury unanimously cleared him of affray.Following six days of evidence and only two and a half hours of deliberations, the verdict allowed the 27-year-old former England vice-captain to walk free from Bristol crown court.The CPS has faced criticism for its preparation of the case. Having initially brought a charge of affray against Stokes, the prosecutor, Nicholas Corsellis, then attempted to add two counts of assault to the indictment.But the judge, Peter Blair QC, the recorder of Bristol, rejected the application at the beginning of the trial. He said it was “hard to see how the defence could have objected” if the new charges had been added in February, but Stokes’ legal team had prepared for a trial on an affray charge and should not be ambushed with a last-minute change.The CPS was also criticised for not prosecuting Stokes’ teammate Alex Hales, who was seen on CCTV kicking one of the accused, Ryan Hale, in the head while he lay on the floor injured. Hales was questioned under caution but never arrested. With the jury absent, Stephen Mooney, representing Hale, told the judge: “I struggle to understand how the crown, in adopting the stance they have, have come to the conclusion that overt acts of direct violence used by an inidual to someone on the floor is not worthy of prosecution.”Stokes was arrested in the early hours of 25 September last year after a night out with England teammates to celebrate a victory over the West Indies earlier in the day.The court heard the incident described as “a sustained episode of significant violence” from Stokes, who had “lost control”. But Stokes’ lawyers told the jury he had “stepped in” to defend two gay men who were being verbally abused.The CPS declined to say whether key charging decisions had been made at its London headquarters or locally in Bristol. Even though affray is a relatively low-level offence, at one stage the case had been due to be prosecuted by Alison Morgan, first junior treasury counsel. Treasury counsel are appointed by the attorney general to lead in some of the most serious criminal cases.A CPS spokesperson said Morgan was instructed after the initial charging decision, was sent the prosecution papers but then had to withdraw because of a “diary clash”. She did not attend any hearings in Bristol. The spokesperson added: “The CPS keeps cases under continual review. We selected the charge of affray at the outset in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors. Upon further review we considered that additional assault charges would also be appropriate. The judge decided not to permit us to add these further charges. The original charge of affray adequately reflected the criminality of the case and we proceeded on that.“The function of the Crown Prosecution Service is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges for a jury to consider. We respect the jury’s decision.”Asked whether the CPS would be conducting a review of how the case was handled, the spokesperson said it would not be doing so.

What holidays are the fashionable children taking this year? Diane, by emailI’ve been thinking a lot about kids on holiday because I have spent a lot of time recently looking at photos of celebrities’ children on holidays. Has it always been thus? I’m not so sure that it has. I don’t remember seeing photos of, say, Kenny G’s kids on holiday in the 90s, and yet I could now give you a detailed breakdown of John Legend’s kids’ holiday wardrobes. (Is it wrong to compare Legend to Kenny G? But they both make wedding dance music and have daft surnames! Fine, I admit it, I don’t get the appeal of Legend’s music – not, of course, that this has stopped me from devoting thousands of hours of my life to his Instagram feed, and that of his wife.)It is gross to look at photos of kids and judge them, but I’m not doing that, I swear (I’m judging the parents). The real joy of looking at photos of celebrities’ kids is seeing the disjunct between the image and the text. It is, of course, obligatory for celebrities to say that they are giving their children a normal upbringing, how their kids definitely don’t have lives like something out of a 90s hip-hop music video – no, not at all, they’re totally normal! And such quotes are invariably accompanied by a photo of said six-year-old standing in a swimming pool on a yacht sipping an elaborate fruit drink. That’s Blue Ivy Carter, folks, and she’s out there living large for all of us.Gwyneth Paltrow, a favourite of this column, is always a good one for this, talking at length about how her kids have totally normal lives, usually right after they’ve been on the main stage at Glastonbury to sing with their dad, Chris Martin. Which is sweet, no question, but, let’s be honest, not exactly normal. But la Paltrow possibly has a skewed perception of “normal”, given she once insisted that parents with “an office job” have fewer challenges than she does as a millionaire movie actor, because their lives are more “routine”. Thank you, Gwyneth. Never stop being you.A classic example of this genre appeared this week when Elton John and David Furnish and their two boys were photographed by the paparazzi holidaying on a yacht in the south of France. At least one of the little boys was wearing a shirt from Gucci, John’s new favourite designer label, and there were many sweet pictures of the boys jumping off the boat into the clear sea, watched carefully by John, Furnish and what looked like a battalion of staff.The tabloids ran these pap shots alongside some pointedly choice quotes from John about how he and Furnish are raising the children, including some from an interview in the  in 2016 in which he talked about how the boys do chores around the house “to learn the value of doing something and earning something for themselves”.“I came from a very working-class background where I had to work for everything I got and I want to instil those same values in them. But it’s harder growing up in this world and David and I are very mindful of that,” John recently told Hello!.Now, before we continue, I feel I need to make something clear: I love Elton John. I love his music, I love his grumpy-cat face and I especially love how he can clearly bitch for Britain, and any man who can do that is welcome to take me on his yacht any time he fancies. I also love how much he clearly adores his family, and the photos of him holding his little boys’ hands as they pootle about together in Cannes are probably the cutest things I’ve seen this week that don’t involve my own kids.But my point is: why do celebrities bother with this nonsense? Of course their children don’t have normal lives – it would be downright weird if they did, given their parents most certainly don’t have normal lives. Are they saying their kids fly back in economy while their parents are in the private jet? The kids are given out-of-date frozen fish fingers while their parents eat organic feasts cooked by the private chef? Do they sleep in a creaky flat in the suburbs while their parents are in a quadruple-fronted gated house in Notting Hill? What kind of monsters are these parents?I get that (some) celebrities really do care about their kids not being spoiled brats, and I fully believe that John is such a parent. I also get that they themselves don’t want to come across as obnoxious jerks and therefore don’t feel able to say: “Yeah, obviously my kid has been flying in private jets since she was in utero and she wouldn’t recognise Gap Kids if it slapped her in the face with a Gucci sandal.” But we all know it’s true and, frankly, we’d call child protection services if it wasn’t. Enjoy those yachts, kids. We’d worry if you were anywhere else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef4cb4ee1e94b30be7c39380beaa32f50a00edd/0_235_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=163ba999960c6de0f70f5ac79c52682a","title":"cohousing facility 50s to 70s well run communities","story":"In this series Poppy Noor discusses an issue concerning how we can build happy, well-run communities. But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesWe are a group of people wanting to design care and residential facilities in accord with our own needs and outlooks. The ethos of the project is social justice – a non-profit set-up offering excellent standards, excellent pay and conditions for staff, and a sense of ownership through giving our time and skills for as long as is possible. We range from our 50s to mid-70s and none of us are yet in need of care. However, we know that it won’t be too long before some of us need it. We all own our homes and could sell up and pool our money to create the funds to start the project. In other words, we will use our money to pay for care upfront, rather than later, through care fees to a home that doesn’t meet our needs. We could start out living semi-communally, with our own self-contained units and making good use of communal rooms and dining facilities, until such time as we need more care, when we could move to the main house. We could run a social enterprise cafe on site that is for the local community, along with pilates, yoga and other classes open to the public. But we would like your advice on how, and where, to start.It sounds like you have a strong circle of friends, who are able to support one another, and the key thing is keeping those people around you in later life. I spoke to a former social worker, Lorraine Clarke, who set up her own care agency, about the trials and tribulations you may encounter. Her main tip is to be aware that there might be a point when you can no longer look after each other alone: “As a community they will get used to each other’s support – but if their needs become too high they will have to call in an external care provider.” To ensure it’s not too difficult a transition, Clarke suggests building openness early on: “They could have coffee mornings or pilates sessions where they call in the agencies they might work with later so they can build a connection with them.”When Clarke first set up her care company, they worked with a social enterprise called Menta, which helps small businesses start up: “It was great, they helped us to understand about profit and loss, to build networks and understand marketing,” she says. The financial side can be difficult: “If they sell up, it’s a huge risk. They could be chucking their life’s money into buying an old residential home – they will need to live and pay off the new mortgage.” Be aware of what you can access through the local authority, through the 2014 Care Act in England, for example, but sound financial advice is a must: “Knowing what kind of care you want is a great start, but it’s not enough. They’ll need a good bookkeeper, a good accountant. If they want to be a social enterprise, they will need someone to help with a website and social media, too,” says Clarke.Luckily, there are many around you who may be able to advise further. According to website cohousing.org.uk there are already 21 established co-housing communities in the country, and UK cohousing network senior ambassador Maria Brenton points to community cohousing funds and information hubs being set up regionally for information. If you want to employ people, you’ll have to register with the Care Quality Commission, but Brenton warns that many care homes are going bust. The Older Women’s Co-Living House (OWCH), which Brenton helped to set up, has a website full of information. For them, Brenton says seeking care outside the home, combined with communal living, works perfectly: “We have some residents in their 70s, with conditions like cancer. They go off to appointments but when they come back, they have people who help with shopping and cooking meals, can pick up their prescriptions or take them to outpatient appointments. It’s a neighbourly environment, which we believe delays the need for care.”You should think about people outside your immediate circle, in the local neighbourhood too: if you are putting on pilates classes or other activities, is there a way you can ensure fair access to all people in the community? Indeed, is there a way of finding out what classes local residents would like?In the end, it will be worth it: “Community work does amazing things for people,” says Clarke. “It’s frustrating that we spend so much time throwing money at people when they get to a crisis, rather than building meaningful lives for them. Just because you get older, it doesn’t mean you want to stop living.”When I ask for her biggest piece of advice, she chuckles: “Tell them to keep smiling, and not to give up in the first 18 months. Those are the hardest, but once they come out the other side, what they have achieved will be incomparable.”• What do you think? Or have you got a question for Poppy and readers to consider?

On Wednesday the high court ruled it had misled the businesswoman about its “exclusive” membership.Delivering the ruling, Judge Richard Parkes QC said: “Gertrude Stein quipped that whoever said money can’t buy happiness didn’t know where to shop.“This case is about a woman looking for romantic happiness who says she was tricked into shopping in the wrong place, paying a large sum to a dating agency which, she says, made promises but failed to produce the goods.”Burki, 47, a mother of three who lives in Chelsea, approached the dating service in 2013 in pursuit of a new partner. “Her requirements were not modest,” the judge observed.What she wanted was a “sophisticated gentleman”, ideally employed in the finance industry. It was important that he should lead a “wealthy lifestyle” and be “open to travelling internationally”.Her most important requirement was a willingness to have more children since she had always wanted four. Burki was encouraged by what she read about Seventy Thirty and eventually signed up, paying £12,600.The judge said the agency’s then managing director, Lemarc Thomas, claimed there was a substantial number of wealthy male members actively engaged in its matchmaking services who were a sufficient match for Burki’s desires.This was false and misleading, said the judge, because there were only about 100 active male members altogether. That number could not “by any stretch of the imagination” be described as a substantial number, even without considering how far that number would have to be reduced to allow for compliance with her criteria.“Had Ms Burki known what the true size of the active membership was, she would not have joined Seventy Thirty,” he said. She was induced to enter her contract with the agency by the false representations given by Thomas, who must have known he was giving her a wholly false impression, he added.In her legal action, Burki sought the return of her membership fee and damages for distress. The agency counter-sued her for libel and malicious falsehood in connection with two online reviews she wrote.The judge awarded her £12,600 damages for deceit and £500 for distress. He awarded Seventy Thirty £5,000 for libel relating to an April 2016 Google review by Burki.Ruling on the agency’s libel claim, Parkes said he had not found the business was a fundamentally dishonest or fraudulent operation, although at the time it probably had a short supply of suitable men.Had Thomas explained to Burki that the database included active members, former members who still wished to be matched, and people who had been headhunted and had agreed to be put on the database in the hope of finding a suitable partner, she would have had little cause for complaint, Parkes said. Susie Ambrose, the founder and company director of Seventy Thirty, said Burki had joined with the “lofty and unrealistic” expectations of how many men she would be introduced to through the agency.“We are a niche, exclusive agency, not a mainstream, mass-market online dating service. We are not going to have thousands of members because there simply aren’t thousands of single, wealthy, high-calibre prospects out there,” Ambrose said.She added: “By her own admission in court, Ms Burki never read the terms and conditions … Ms Burki was found to have libelled Seventy Thirty, as the judge said that we had sourced excellent matches for her. Therefore, her remarks about us being a non-reputable and fraudulent company were deemed untrue and entirely without foundation.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423972d30e0fcb4e900c84caa7d83fa7d61a01df/0_30_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65de3274bf5a7b90d3cbf214f8e7a761","title":"stick to carry on luggage how to make travelling more bearable","story":"From picking the right seat on a flight to how best to use your time if you get stuck at an airport, there are plenty of easy wins to be had if you plan ahead Travelling can seem fun and romantic when you’re sitting in your house dreaming about it, but the reality can be a little more tedious. But whether it’s spending endless hours trapped in overseas airports or sitting on the tarmac in a stationary plane, there are things you can do to make it a little more bearable, a little less mind-numbing, and your legs a little less cramped. Sort out your baggageIt is entirely possible to avoid that inner monologue of doom as you watch the baggage carousel go round and round, mentally listing all the things you’re going to have to live without because you’ll never see your suitcase again. Do they even sell pants in Spain? If you’re not going away for too long, try to stick to carry-on luggage only: leaving the airport without pausing by the luggage carousel will make you feel like you’ve cheated death. Find the maximum size they’ll allow in the cabin, and make sure the suitcase comes on two wheels, not four (if you get the four wheel version you’re missing out on a couple of inches of precious packing space, which you’ll notice even if you’re one of those supreme master packers who rolls everything). As an added extra, find a laptop bag that you can loop over the handle of your suitcase. That way, you can drag the whole thing behind you with one hand and check your Twitter in a different time zone with the other. Pick your seat wiselyIf you’re flying economy and don’t want to shell out any extra for an exit row, aim for the second last row of the plane. Outside of priority boarding, you’ll be among the first to board and have the best chance of ending up with empty seats beside you if the flight isn’t full. And while the seats in the second last row recline, those poor folk way at the back have to sit upright the whole way.If you get stuck in an airportSo you’re in another country but you can’t go exploring outside, and you’ve already looped the duty free several times and come out smelling like a vat of perfume.

From the stunning coastlines of Crete, to the lively festivals of Thessaloniki and the sacred sites of Delphi, the country combines beautiful landscapes with rich mythology and literature. Go on a sunset wine tour beside the bright-blue seas and domes of Santorini, believed to have been the home of the mythical land of Atlantis. Or visit Delos, where Apollo, the god of poetry, truth and prophecy, is said to have been born. Travel to one of the world’s largest natural harbours in Ithaca and you’ll see why Odysseus is intent on returning here in Homer’s Odyssey. Literature is inescapable in Greece. Athens offers its own tour of the spots where writers from all over the world once spent their time keen cyclists can take a three-hour bike tour around historic Athens and Plaka. Families with teens can be led around the city by a street-art expert, exploring the graffiti and urban art of a thriving creative scene. And if it’s great food you’re after, why limit yourself to eating when you can learn how to make it too? Join one of the city’s cooking lessons designed to give tourists a chance to recreate seven traditional Greek dishes, before heading home with a recipe book.If you’re in the market for a lazy holiday of sun, sand and sea, Crete could be the place for you. With its secluded bays and pink-sand beaches, Greece’s largest island is stunning and hospitable. Elounda is perhaps the fanciest part – a good spot if you’ve got a bit of cash to spend, or for the honeymooners. Alternatively, you could take the heart-stopping drive through narrow roads on steep cliffs to Stefanou Beach, an incredible cove of turquoise water. Elafonisi Beach is the place for pastel-pink sand. It is near a national park where tourists are known to come and do a five-hour hike through the gorge. Nature lovers might also enjoy Pátmos, designated as the “Holy Island” of Greece. Its settlement, Chorá, is a world heritage site, where white houses sparkle under the Aegean sun between historical streets leading from the island’s port, Skála, to the famous monastery. This is where John the Apostle wrote the Book of Revelation, having been banished to Pátmos by the Roman authorities. Ultimately, Greece’s extraordinary literary legacy is evident almost everywhere you look. Whether you’re exploring the inner cities or taking time out on the beach, a holiday in Greece is a great chance to familiarise yourself with the abundance of literature written about this ancient, mythical and beautiful country. And you might want to start with any number of the audiobooks listed below, perfect for listeners heading there this summer.The Magus by John Fowles, NaxosNicholas Urfe is a young Brit teaching English on a fictional Greek island, based on Spetses. Bored and consumed by his loneliness, he stumbles on to a wealthy estate and its Greek owner, Maurice Conchis, a man who may have collaborated with the Nazis. The two develop a friendship, and Nicholas is drawn into Conchis’s mysterious ways and psychological games, becoming a performer in re-enactments of the Nazi occupation and obscene parodies of Greek mythology. This is a chilling thriller, as well as a postmodern classic, in which the narrator, Nicholas, grows unsure of what is real. Many of its settings exist, however. The Lord Byron School, where Nicholas teaches, is the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, and Villa Bourani is a private house on the south side of the island, overlooking a popular public beach.The Names by Don DeLillo, MacmillanDeLillo knows how to write a dense and elusive novel. And he doesn’t miss the mark in this tale about the mythological world. The characters are bizarre, yet well realised, and the author uses their story to look at family loss and language. It’s classic DeLillo, in so far as all the players are smart and eloquent, including the children, and it is stylish throughout – much more than just your average exotic thriller. Set in Athens, this is a story that moves away from conventional plot to focus on politics, culture, religion and mythology.Murder in Mykonos by Jeffrey Siger, HachetteWhen a backpacker goes missing on the island of Mykonos, no one is sure if it is her body that is found in the ancient church. Andreas Kaldis, the new chief of police, recently arrived from Athens, is faced with an island of locals who are used to doing things their own way. The case reminds him, and veteran homicide investigator Tassos Stamatos, of the ritualistic murders of a few years ago, but the suspect has since killed himself. So who could the killer be? The book reveals its author’s intimate knowledge of Mykonos, with very visual descriptions and lots of information about the historic churches. Perhaps it’s no surprise this was a bestseller in Greece.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, PenguinIn the newest novel by the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, Hamid tells a story about migration, in which the refugee journey happens through a portal. While living in an unnamed country taken over by war, Nadia and Saeed hear of “doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away”. The couple pass through a portal and find that they are on the Greek island of Mykonos, in a refugee camp. Here, “everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was”. Exit West is a timely tale about the global refugee crisis, much of which Greece has witnessed first hand. This modern history of the country is just as compelling as its mythology.Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières, AudibleSet on the Greek island of Kefalonia, the novel follows Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain who comes to the island in the early days of the second world war. Corelli begins a love affair with Pelagia, the daughter of local doctor Iannis. Their relationship is complicated, as is to be expected in wartime, and atrocities mount around them, in both their personal lives and the life of the island itself. This is a love story and a war story – a tale of an island that is occupied first by the Italians, then the Germans. The characters are gloriously rendered and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin uses its magical setting to tell a now-famous story about romance and courage.Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, Laughing StockYou’ve probably seen the film, adapted from the play of the same name. Shirley is a lonely middle-aged Liverpudlian woman in a loveless marriage. When her friend offers to take her on holiday to Greece, she packs her bags and heads for the sun. The gorgeous island of Mykonos is a strong attraction for both tourists and, seemingly, many of the writers who go there. And it’s the same for Shirley, who rediscovers herself here, along with the happiness she’s been longing for. Hers is a story of finding self-confidence, and recognising it’s never too late to start again.Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, Recorded BooksMaybe you’ve seen the film too? Written by Cretan Kazantzakis, the novel tells the story of a Greek intellectual who befriends working man Alexis Zorba. Zorba is a larger than life and unpredictable, unlike the narrator, who is modest and reserved. The two become friends, and the passion in Zorba’s character reminds both narrator and reader of the joys of living. Set in Crete, the tale captures the island’s passionate spirit – full of its smells, tastes and wines.The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, IsisThis is The Iliad skilfully told from another perspective. Writing from the point of view of Achilles’s best friend, Patroclus, Madeline Miller convincingly reimagines the relationship as a romance, casting a different light on the Trojan War. Achilles is given a human touch. He is gentle and capable of love. It’s a new side to an ancient story and it’s super smart. The men are not positioned as brothers in arms, but as the soul mates that Homer hints they might be. Greece’s wealth of mythological and classical literature is complemented by this masterful modern interpretation.My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, AudibleThis autobiographical work tells the story of British zookeeper, conservationist and TV presenter Gerald Durrell’s childhood on the Greek island of Corfu, where he discovered his interest in the natural world. Home-schooled during this period, Durrell became friends with a Greek doctor, Theodore Stephanides, who acted as a mentor to the boy and kindled his fascination with local fauna. The book is as much about the author’s family experiences as it is about Corfu. “It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island,” wrote Durrell, “but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages.” My Family and Other Animals is as charming as it is full of sunny olive groves and cypress trees, and all the more enjoyable for it.Mythos by Stephen Fry, PenguinAncient Greek literature has inspired creators from Shakespeare to Walt Disney. The Greek myths are told to you here by the ever-soothing voice of Stephen Fry, who takes you from Zeus to Athena with his typical humour. The Greek gods of the past become relatable, as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven into their stories. It is joyfully informal, yet full of the literary legacy threaded through so much of the tapestry of contemporary Greece.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

But even as clouds scud across Mediterranean skies and beautifully lukewarm seawater laps at our toes, we find ourselves blindly, instinctively reaching for our phones.We open social media, we scroll, we squint and the stress pours back into our heads, in a grey, British shower of hashtags and tedious arguments. Now, we can’t be expected to leave our phones at home when we go on holiday, but if we really have to take them with us, we can at least use them for more therapeutic ends. Audiobooks are a great answer. They entertain without invading. And a beach holiday is the perfect salubrious, loungy location to discover them. There’s (usually) no sound pollution other than the lapping of waves and the occasional caw of a wheeling seagull. It’s the perfect setting to channel your mind, and lose yourself in undulating prose and smoothly vocalised descriptions of everything from blooming gardens to sweltering South Asian streets. So, sack off social media and e into the cool, sonorous world of some of Audible’s most beach-worthy critically acclaimed audiobooks. White Teeth by Zadie Smith, PenguinThis audiobook, narrated by Pippa Bennett-Warner, Ray Panthaki, Sagar Arya and Lenny Henry, is a kaleidoscopic 18-hour rendering of Smith’s irresistible debut. It follows the lives of three turbulent, hilariously dysfunctional west London families – one Bengali, one British-Jamaican, and one white British. The characters spin, snog, slap and seethe their way through a sparkling satire, featuring sharp observations on race, religion and class. Keep an ear out for young Bengali mother Alsana, one of the most appealing and hilarious fictional characters ever created.The Swimming-Pool Library by Alan Hollinghurst, AudibleHollinghurst is known for his heady tales of sex and swimming, and The Swimming-Pool Library could not fit the bill better. It’s an unapologetically steamy portrait of gay life in 1980s London – from its flagrantly fragrant descriptions of breathy encounters in public parks, to its sensual languishing over lunches in private members’ clubs. It’s an intriguing, rare and almost arrogantly assured depiction of the life of a young, privileged, beautiful gay man. The audiobook is narrated in suitably cut-glass tones by Samuel West.Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, CSA WordThere are few things more pleasurable in life than lying on the beach while Joanna Lumley reads you Jane Austen’s classic, Pride and Prejudice. It is perhaps the most plummily pastoral audiobook on Audible (or, indeed, anywhere) – Lumley’s voice complements Austen’s thoughtful writing style beautifully. Best enjoyed with a crisp pinot and a punnet of obscenely large strawberries.The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, MacmillanAnother voice that lends itself to audiobooks belongs to quintessentially English, culturally ubiquitous academic powerhouse Stephen Fry. He narrates this wonderfully relaxing recording of Douglas Adams’s surreal sci-fi satire, The Hitchhikers’ Guide to the Galaxy. It’s wonderfully disjointed and weird – Pythonesque in its wildly clever but also joyfully puerile humour. When Earth gets destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass, long-suffering Arthur Dent is thrown into a frenetic star-bursting chaos of aliens, robots, spaceships and … towels.Galápagos by Kurt Vonnegut, AudibleVonnegut’s provocative and startling take on evolution and the human psyche, Galápagos is a landmark work of postmodern literature. It is set in a dystopic 1986 – disease and financial ruin have befallen the majority of the human race, and only a tiny population remains on the fictional island of Santa Rosalia. The plot follows the characters (and their evolution) over the next million years. Read by Jonathan Davis.A Caribbean Mystery by Agatha Christie, BBC WorldwideChristie’s works make for excellent holiday listening – and A Caribbean Mystery, with its white beaches and slatted sunlight through the shutters of seaside villas, this is the ideal luxury murder mystery to ease you out of hectic home life. There are a few audiobook versions, but this BBC dramatisation, with June Whitfield as Miss Marple, is by far the best. Whitfield perfectly conveys Marple’s bright-eyed bolshiness and takes listeners dreamily on a journey into the tropics.Unseen Academicals by Terry Pratchett, AudibleTerry Pratchett’s Discworld novels are his best known, with their always hilarious and sometimes searing parallels with our own world. The Unseen University is an undeniably Oxbridgian academic institution populated by bumbling, grumbling wizards. In Unseen Academicals, many of their worst fears are realised when a dreaded sport called football arrives on their hallowed turf. This delightful audio drama has a perfectly cast lineup, including David Jason and Jaime Winstone.The Beach by Alex Garland, PenguinGarland’s glamorously bohemian and effortlessly cool cult hit completes the list, read by a perfectly cast Alfie Allen. Hungrily consumed by backpackers, drifters and yoga instructors from Phnom Penh to Penzance since its publication in 1996, The Beach tells of naive traveller Richard, who finds paradise in a secluded cove in Thailand. But before long, the radiant reefs turn rapidly into something carnal and altogether more sinister. Plot-wise, the novel’s a conch-throw away from Lord of the Flies – but with added henna, and ounces and ounces of dope.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

May is allowed to update EU leaders on her plans at quarterly EU summits but is not in the room for discussions.Officials expect this approach to be continued at Salzburg, an informal summit on 20 September officially dedicated to migration. The meeting has been organised by Austria, which currently holds the EU rotating presidency, but it will be for the European council president, Donald Tusk, to decide whether to add Brexit to the agenda.The Salzburg gathering comes four weeks before an EU summit in Brussels, pencilled in by Barnier as the moment to strike a deal. Many in Brussels expect the deadline to slip to November or even December, squeezing the time available to ratify the text ahead of the UK’s departure on 29 March 2019.The British government has tried to get round Barnier by appealing directly to national capitals for greater flexibility, a strategy continued by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who is on a three-day Brexit tour on the continent this week.Latvia’s foreign minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs, said before meeting Hunt that there was a 50-50 chance of failing to reach a deal. “I believe both the EU and the UK need to have extra effort to reach some kind of deal,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Barnier’s mandate is set by the EU’s 27 leaders and there is little appetite to change it, despite Hunt’s calls for a new approach.No one is expecting a dramatic breakthrough from this week’s low-key Brexit negotiations in Brussels, which will be led by officials rather than Barnier and the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab.Last month Raab said that from mid-August there would be “weekly discussions to clear away all the obstacles that lie in our path to a strong deal in October”.On Thursday negotiators will discuss the problem of the Irish border, with the two sides deeply ided over how to avoid customs checks at the crossing. The second day will be devoted to discussing the UK’s future relationship with the EU, outlined in May’s Chequers blueprint.The EU sees serious problems with the Chequers plan and has dismissed the customs ideas as unworkable. However, EU negotiators have not entirely written off May’s plan and see the kernel of a free-trade agreement. But this outcome would fall far short of the prime minister’s hopes for deeper economic ties. EU officials insist they cannot break up the EU’s single market and its “four freedoms” of goods, capital, services and people. “I can’t imagine we would walk away from that,” said one diplomat. “It is the raison d’être of the EU. We can’t have Brexit threaten our political and economic system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bdf721559873740312df64f47f9dcb3bec1ada/0_340_5097_3058/master/5097.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3cf4227f019c0ead6143141082a36c2","title":"majority of scottish voters feel ignored by uk ministers on brexit","story":"Support in Scotland for remain has risen since 2016 referendum, poll suggestsAlmost two-thirds of Scottish voters believe the Westminster government is ignoring their concerns during Brexit negotiations, and there is now more support in Scotland for remaining in the EU than at the time of the 2016 referendum, polling suggests.About 600 people are expected to attend a rally in Edinburgh on Saturday in support of another vote on Brexit, as part of a summer of action coordinated by the People’s Vote campaign.Peter Kellner, a polling expert and former president of YouGov, said: “Support for a public vote on the outcome is growing across the UK but is particularly strong in Scotland where most people did not want to leave in the first place. There is deep pessimism about what Brexit will mean for Scotland and the next generation.“But the survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters.

She was single, suffered from endometriosis, and contemplated a hysterectomy. After several years, the nudges took hold. Because she wasn’t a good candidate to freeze only her eggs, she was advised to undergo IVF and freeze fertilized embryos.In 2016 Rasmussen, then living in Queensland in Australia, decided to take the plunge. A friend offered his services, but she worried that if she knew the father, but he wasn’t involved, she or her child could feel hurt. If she wanted sperm, she’d have to buy it.For Rasmussen, a striking brunette of multi-ethnic background, looks or an attraction to the donor weren’t a factor. Neither was race it would be difficult to match what she knew of her own ethnic background anyway. She wanted someone who might fit her family personality-wise. That included a love of music and a sense of humor.In Australia, Rasmussen found fewer than 10 potential local donors. Her doctor told her that “because there’s such a small number of male sperm donors in Queensland, the quality isn’t very high, particularly as these particular men have been donating sperm for some time, and they are older generally”.Her doctor made a recommendation: go American.Her fertility center gave her the password to a protected site – the catalogue. It contained a mix of Australian and American men. “Go and have fun with it,” the andrologist suggested. “Invite your girlfriends around, have some wine and cheese, and choose a donor.”Rasmussen didn’t like that idea. Instead, in the midst of the most modern method of starting a family, she embarked on the most old-fashioned: she let her father choose.“My dating life has been kind of a running joke in the family. At that point I didn’t want to make a decision alone. I also thought it would be kind of nice to involve my father,” she said.“He took my laptop and he logged in and he sat there looking very serious for about 45 minutes, and then he handed it back to me and said, ‘There’s only one.’” He wouldn’t tell her which, she recalled, laughing. “So I went through myself and had a look and in the end I came to exactly the same conclusion. I said the code number, and he’s like, ‘Yup.’”For both father and daughter, the 23-year old, dark-haired American with a touch of acne was a clear-cut, one-in-20 standout.On the 17-page file provided to clients, he wrote that he became a donor because “he wanted to spread his awesome genes throughout the world,” which, Rasmussen acknowledges, “was such an arrogant thing to say. It made me laugh because it really showed me how young he was. I felt like he was joking when he said that, like he was saying it to be tongue-in-cheek. We hope.”Demand for US sperm is on the rise. Not just American Danish semen is also used by women around the world. The reasons are as varied and distinctive as each country’s own regulations and approach to bioethics and business.Sperm from the US and Denmark dominate the market because those countries currently have the most supply, experts say. It’s unclear whether their rivalry is serious or in jest, but US-based California Cryobank and Denmark’s Cryos International each insist that their sperm repository is biggest.California Cryobank claims it is the largest sperm bank in the world by “any metric” Scott Brown, director of client experience, noted that the firm has a pool of roughly 600 donors and a track record of 75,000 live births globally since 1977. The company has locations in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and New York.In Denmark, Cryos, the superstore for Viking sperm, is the main player. “California Cryobank is definitely the largest in the United States, but worldwide, we absolutely crush them,” Corey Burke, the tissue bank director at Cryos International’s Florida outpost, told the .“In Europe alone, we have close to 1,400 active and real donors in the US around 200 donors,” Burke said. “We sell to over 100 countries worldwide. We own Europe. If you want sperm in Europe, Cryos comes up, always,” added Burke. The email signature on Cryos emails boasts: “The highest number of registered pregnancies in the world.”One reason the US and Denmark are the heaviest hitters in the global sperm market: Laws allowing anonymity for donors, said Ayo Wahlberg, an anthropology professor at the University of Copenhagen.California Cryobank changed its policy this year, to take only non-anonymous donations going forward. Historically, heterosexual couples have tended to favor anonymous donations and offspring whose physical resemblance wouldn’t give rise to questions about paternity. However, with lesbian and single mothers, the use of a donor is obvious, and clients and their children tend to be curious about their backgrounds.“The concept of being an anonymous donor now is pretty hard to control, with services like 23andMe and Ancestry anyway,” California Cryobank’s Brown said. “Suggesting to a donor he could remain anonymous seemed like it wasn’t realistic.”At California Cryobank, the current breakdown is: 308 anonymous donors 116 “open donors”, who agree to be contacted through the bank as an intermediary and 134 “ID disclosure”, who agree to direct contact, said Brown. In all cases, any relationship is initiated exclusively by the offspring, not the donor.Laws dictating how many families or children a single donor can provide also affect a country’s sperm practice. For example, in the UK one donor can only endow 10 families domestically. In Spain, which mandates anonymous donation, it’s six live births (factoring in a donor’s own children).The US has no limit to how many families can use one donor. In Denmark, one man can contribute to 12 families, maximum. But internationally, he may provide to six couples in Sweden and eight in Switzerland, and so on. “It’s not exactly illegal,” said Wahlberg. “One donor in Denmark could father 30, 50, 80 children. Who knows?”There are other factors that affect sperm supply. In the US, Denmark and China (which has a massive sperm bank but does not export), donors are paid or compensated relatively comparable amounts (ranging from $30 to $130 per sample). In the UK, Canada, Australia and many European Union countries, donors must be “altruistic”: payment is forbidden. Travel and childcare expenses may be reimbursed.Then there’s technology. “Testing and screening in the US is far more advanced, and there is a lot of ersity in the population who are willing to be donors, and obviously a lot of people,” said Fredrik Andreasson, chief finance officer of Seattle Sperm Bank. He said Caucasian sperm is in high demand globally, including in China and India.A 36-year old Dutch national who works for a prestigious international organization told the  she would have chosen American sperm, even if she wasn’t living in New York, because fertility treatment there is better than in the Netherlands.“The donor market in US is larger,” the single mother, who asked not to use her name, said. “I don’t think there is always good quality control in place, but the vast choice of banks – if you have the means like I did – is good.”For her, the most important criteria was that the donor have a post-graduate education and be open to being contacted by her child. She chose a Caucasian with a PhD who works at Nasa and appeared as a “particularly cute and happy boy” in photos. Her six-week-old son looks like her, though, she said.The US lacks uniform regulation. “We certainly don’t have any federal level requirements around egg donation and sperm donation, save for the FDA requiring that sperm banks do contagious disease testing,” Yale sociology professor Rene Almeling said, adding that there is no required genetic testing.“We don’t have any regulations about how often donors donate, how much they’re paid, how many children can be born from any one donor.”The opposite is true in France, which gives birth to other issues.In France, there is a state-run, national sperm bank. “So they know exactly how many donors they have and how often they donate and how many children are born with which birth defects, etc.,” Almeling said.France used to require that to receive that sperm, you had to be a heterosexual, married couple. “They have dropped the marriage requirement, so now you just have to be a heterosexual couple, but you cannot be a single woman or a lesbian couple,” Almeling said.“So France has regulated sperm donation, but it’s also written discrimination into the regulations, such that lesbians and single women often get on the train to purchase it from, say, the Netherlands.”Through her one IVF cycle, Rasmussen was able to retrieve five eggs. Three were fertilized and are currently stored in Brisbane, where she lives.“It’s not an insurance policy really by any means. It’s just something I did that could give me a better chance than not doing it,” she said.Having recently started a promising new job in digital marketing, and having just turned 40, she’s unsure about the future.“Within the next year or so, I’ll have a better handle on what I’ll do going forward and whether I’ll become a mum,” she said. Still, she already has responsibilities to her three zygotes.She joked: “I feel like their parent.

It is in orbit about a star 650 light years from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus, the swan. The ultra hot planet is about 30 times closer to its host star than the Earth is to the sun – and its star is also twice as hot as the sun. As a result, temperatures on Kelt-9b reach 4,000C on the side that faces the star. This is not as hot as our Sun, which is almost 6,000C, but hotter than many stars.Due to its proximity to the star, the planet orbits the star every 36 hours, with the same side always facing inwards. This means there is constant daytime on one side and constant night on the other, creating extreme temperature variations across the planet. The temperature of the night side is probably still about 2,000C, though, Heng suggested.Detailed measurements of the orbit suggest the planet is gaseous, probably mostly hydrogen and possibly with a small solid core. The latest observations, published in Nature, are the first to reveal the composition of the planet’s atmosphere.The team used the Galileo National Telescope in La Palma, Canary Islands, to observe the planet precisely as it was moving in front of its host star. By detecting the tiny fraction of light from the star that filters through the planet’s atmosphere, the astronomers were able to detect components in the atmosphere and show that these included iron vapour and titanium. This is the first time that metals have been spotted on planets beyond the solar system.In future, the same techniques could be used to detect hints of life elsewhere in the Universe.“It doesn’t matter if we’re trying to detect titanium, oxygen or some strange molecule that is indicative of life,” said Heng. “These hot planets are a testing ground for techniques that we will use when the really interesting planets start to show up over the next few years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ba397c0a1d5b7ca548dcf7dcccecd185c13d122/0_114_2345_1406/master/2345.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21304542a6bad49119d9f9a6bb023330","title":"adele shares story of friends postpartum psychosis to help new mothers","story":"‘Talk about how you’re feeling,’ singer urges, as experts say taboos can leave people isolatedPerinatal health experts and campaigners have praised the singer Adele for highlighting the issue of postpartum psychosis in new mothers.Her best friend, Laura Dockrill – a poet, author, illustrator and short story writer – was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis after giving birth to a boy, who is Adele’s godson. Adele, who has spoken candidly about her own struggles with postnatal depression following the birth of her son Angelo, shared the “intimate, witty, heartbreaking and articulate” blog written by her friend about the experience with her 32.6m followers on Instagram, saying: “Mamas, talk about how you’re feeling, because in some cases it could save yours or someone else’s life.”In an article written for Mother Of Fall Lists, Dockrill described how her life spiralled out of control after the birth of her son six months ago, and she suffered “insomnia, delusions, suspiciousness and paranoia”.In the blog, Dockrill – who had no previous history of mental illness – said her doctor believes the illness could have been triggered by a “horrific” labour, which left her feeling like she had “pushed out my personality as well as a baby”.At one point she was separated from her baby for two weeks to enable her to recover, and at her lowest ebb her partner, Hugo, sent her pictures of herself, and her friends and family to remind her who she was.She is now recovering with the help of the right medication, a psychiatrist and her family and is feeling “happy, confident and strong”, she wrote. Elizabeth Duff, senior policy advisor at the National Childbirth Trust, praised both women for speaking out about their mental health issues.“It is very important for women to share their stories and talk about their mental health, in the same way we talk about the physical aspects of childbirth,” she said. “Most women give birth without trauma, but having taboo about any issue around childbirth can leave people more isolated, feeling more guilty and with less knowledge about what they are experiencing.”It is not clear what causes postpartum psychosis, according to the NHS, although family history, a previous episode of postpartum psychosis, and people with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia are thought to be more at risk. Experts also believe that a traumatic birth or pregnancy can also be a trigger. It can have devastating consequences: in 2014 new mother Charlotte Bevan, 30, killed herself and her baby after walking out of hospital in Bristol.In June, the NCT revealed that nearly half of mothers experienced mental health problems at some time during pregnancy or in the first year of their child’s life, and almost half of these mothers did not have the problem addressed by a doctor or other health professional.Earlier this year, experts and mental health practitioners welcomed a commitment from NHS England to spend £365m on perinatal mental health services, but warned that women suffering from postpartum psychosis and other mental health illnesses still face a postcode lottery when it comes to care.There are 111 beds across the 15 mother and baby units (MBUs), but that is not enough with no facilities in Northern Ireland, and Wales, two in Scotland and large areas of south-west, eastern and north-west England without a facility.Dr Virginia Beckett, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said that – despite improvements – provision for women with postpartum psychosis was still woefully inadequate, with 111 beds in MBUs for the 750 women per year who were likely to need them. “I think awareness among professionals is improving and we are recognising the impact of traumatic birth experiences on mental health,” she said. “I think we have to stop insisting that pregnancy and childbirth have to be perfect, by their very nature they are imperfect and if we didn’t feel under pressure from unachievable standards, we might not feel like such failures when it doesn’t work out quite like that.”When Elaine Hanzak had her son 22 years ago, little was known about postpartum psychosis. “I got comments like, ‘I’m surprised at you you have everything you have always wanted’, and ‘pull yourself together’,” said Hanzak, who wrote Eyes Without Sparkle: a Journey through Postnatal Illness. She became ill seven months after her child was born, finding herself one rainy December night on the steps on a local church in only her nightgown. “I was looking for their peace of mind. I didn’t want to die but I needed my brain to stop. It is constant, there is no off switch,” she said. “It feels like it won’t end, which is why people take their own lives.”Hanzak went on to recover fully and has since spoken to hundreds of other families who are dealing with the illness. “That is the message: you can get better, even if you don’t feel you can.” Although she didn’t have a second child, she said mothers who have experienced the illness can get support if they choose to become pregnant again. “People need the tolls to have the conversations and put a plan in place, but perinatal illness doesn’t have to be a contraception.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2667e5c745cf3c8374f48e21eae68012202d3720/0_56_2128_1277/master/2128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26b5b89dcf1197f26f6c6af74fdbb444","title":"jamie jones buchanan rugby league faith leeds","story":"Growing up in a working‑class suburb of Leeds dreaming of becoming a professional rugby player, Jamie Jones‑Buchanan always knew he was different. “I always believed in something when I was younger, but I didn’t really know what it was,” he\u0026nbspadmits. “How could I really? I’m\u0026nbspjust a lad from Bramley who wanted to make it and realise his dreams as a rugby player.”Jones-Buchanan emphatically ticks all the boxes for people who may have in mind a stereotype of an English rugby league player. The strong northern accent, the passion for the sport, the imposing frame – and the mental and physical battle scars from a near 20-year career.Scratch beneath the surface, though, and the perception soon changes.Most people have their own ways of unwinding after a tough day at the office Jones-Buchanan spends his spare time at the City Evangelical\u0026nbspChurch in Beeston, Leeds, sharing his beliefs and practising Christianity. The 37-year-old, who has spent his entire career with his hometown club, began his journey via the wisdom of a new teammate. “In\u0026nbsp2004 Leeds signed a bloke called Ali\u0026nbspLauiti’iti,” Jones-Buchanan says. “He had a different feel to him immediately he was this burly bloke\u0026nbspwho carried the ball like a peanut – but he was different away from the game.“I didn’t know at the time, but it was a life-changing opportunity when he offered to take me to church for the first time. I\u0026nbspalways had Christianity close to me my nana would say her prayers on a night and I’d do school nativities and things like that, but theologically speaking, I had no idea what the Bible stood for\u0026nbspuntil that day.”Rugby league is renowned for its physical toughness, but the mental strain is almost as visible on players such as Jones-Buchanan. There have been the highs of winning eight Grand Finals during\u0026nbsphis career but also the devastating lows: and his faith has perhaps never been more important than it has this year.Leeds, the defending Super League champions, are in a remarkable battle to avoid relegation. Jones-Buchanan’s involvement has been limited because of a recurring knee injury and he admits his days remaining in the game are limited.“When I go through adverse periods in playing, that trust and belief in Christ is truly what keeps me believing and gets me ready to go again,” Jones-Buchanan says. “You can draw real, tangible links to biblical figures who have endured hardships and times of toughness. This season in particular has been easier to handle in the darker moments because of that. It’s absolutely priceless.“I’ve won countless trophies and achieved a lot, but as we stand right here … it counts for nothing really, does it? Nothing lasts forever, everything is finite, and that directly relates to sport. Whatever I achieve in sport is limited and I refer often to building treasure in heaven. That’s something which lasts eternally.”On Sunday Leeds travel to the London Broncos for a game that could go a long way towards securing their Super League survival. As a devout Christian, it might be anticipated that Jones‑Buchanan is reluctant to play, but he insists: “People think it’s a box-ticking exercise … that you have to be in church every single Sunday. People also think church is full of people like Ned Flanders from The\u0026nbspSimpsons, but it couldn’t be further from the truth.“It’s like sport so much we’re all there trying to achieve the common goal, from a bunch of different backgrounds. If it was up to me I wouldn’t play sport on the Sabbath. But I know that I couldn’t share stories like these without playing\u0026nbsprugby.”Jones-Buchanan is well known within the sport for his entrepreneurial exploits he presents a weekly TV show about the game and is a regular pundit for the BBC . He has even ventured into amateur dramatics as he prepares for life after rugby league.But his faith has also opened doors he could have never imagined growing up. “I’ve done testimonies for the church everywhere,” he says with a smile of pride. “Warrington, St\u0026nbspHelens … even on a barge in Canary Wharf once. That was a bit weird. But it’s an incredible journey, rugby league and faith – and they intertwine more than people realise. Rugby has some brilliant chaplains in it and the people involved care about faith deeply.”And his teammates’ response? “It’s funny … I get asked by the lads and I have invited them to church before,” he says. “I think some people, who don’t really know what it’s about, can be a bit stiff-necked about it when they see big islanders praying on the field after the game – and I think most people are happy for me to get on with it. But we have a responsibility to preach what we believe in. I wouldn’t stop.”Nor will Jones-Buchanan’s playing career end just yet, particularly with his best friend, the Leeds legend Kevin Sinfield, now coaching the Rhinos. “Religion is a lot about succession and what’s next in life, and I do think about that with my career often,” he admits.“I still feel like there’s one more year left in me for whatever reason though. I know I wouldn’t play quite as prominent a role as I have but if Kev told me he wanted to go round one more time? I probably would. I’ve still got plenty to give back to rugby league and the city of Leeds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1235bb6ba2e94e56e0bbeb1e1e849fc0a4994c9a/0_0_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afb3c2058c05a71ebe8f68b9a421255e","title":"contribute to a podcast on the impact of artificial intelligence","story":"In our next We Need to Talk About podcast, we’ll consider the key questions surrounding AI. What are your views?If 2017 was the year artificial intelligence rose to prominence, 2018 is when we’re seeing it go mainstream. Whichever area you work in, it’s likely AI will become increasingly prevalent in your everyday activity. Wherever you are in the world – whether you are an expert in AI, someone whose job increasingly uses AI or simply an interested reader we would like to hear from you.Earlier this year, the  published a long read that asked: Has technology evolved beyond our control? Its author, James Bridle, argued that “our technologies are extensions of ourselves, codified in machines and infrastructures, in frameworks of knowledge and action. Computers are not here to give us all the answers, but to allow us to put new questions, in new ways, to the universe.”Artificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. This is a topic of high priority on the international stage. Vladimir Putin has said he believes “the leader of AI will be the ruler of the world”, and China has stated its ambition to be the global AI leader. Meanwhile, Elon Musk has said he fears the threat of unregulated AI and autonomous weaponry and sent a petition to the United Nations calling for regulations on how AI weapons are developed. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook will use artificial intelligence to fight against a vast variety of platform-spoiling misbehaviour, including fake news, hate speech, discriminatory ads and terrorist propaganda. But are governments acting quickly enough? What is the real threat here and what’s the existing framework of governance for AI technology?AI is now also being used in healthcare to support the work of medical staff, in surveillance, navigation, gambling and gaming, in banking and finance to predict market trends, in the art world as a tool to spot forgeries, in education and even in care for the elderly.How do we ensure this new technology remains ethically sound, and that our data remains secure? Are we doing enough to prepare ourselves for the changes that are coming our way? And how will this impact future generations?’s science editor, Ian Sample, will be part of a panel discussion on this topic, and together he and a selection of industry experts and insiders will answer questions from  supporters.

We don’t think they should be outbid by wealthier people from overseas.”In a speech to parliament on Wednesday he said: “We should not be tenants in our own land.”Only a quarter of adults in New Zealand own their own home, compared with half in 1991, and in the last five years homeless figures have increased, with some New Zealanders forced to live in cars, garages and under bridges.The ban applies to all nationalities, except buyers from Singapore and Australia.New Zealand has become a destination for Chinese, Australian and Asian buyers and has gained a reputation as a bolthole for the world’s wealthy, who view it as a safe haven from a potential nuclear conflict, the rise of terrorism and civil unrest, or simply as a place to get away from it all.Under the new legislation foreigners would still be able to purchase apartments in large-scale block developments off the plans, in an attempt to boost the overall housing stock for New Zealanders.Parker says in places like the Queenstown Lakes, where US multi-millionaires Peter Thiel and Matt Lauer have purchased properties, the ban will induce construction companies to build more smaller, family-friendly homes.However, under the new law Thiel would still be able to buy property in New Zealand. Thiel became a New Zealand citizen despite having spent only eight days in the country after he gained approval under the former government.“We were in opposition at the time Peter Thiel was granted citizenship,” said Parker. “We can’t undo what has already been done. But that won’t happen in the future.”The ban on foreign ownership is at the heart of the government’s plan to tackle the housing crisis, as well as its commitment to build 100,000 affordable new homes in ten years, and increase social housing stock by 6400 homes in four years.Economist Shamubeel Eaqub said although the government’s efforts were “better than nothing” they lacked ambition.The foreign buyer ban would make it “cumbersome” for foreigners to invest in building new housing stock in New Zealand, and that could dissuade them from trying, meaning less homes and apartments could potentially be built, Eaqub said.“The kind of property that billionaires buy is never going to be used for public or social housing. Locking out multi-million dollar buyers doesn’t mean developers will start building smaller, basic houses. There is never a market for poor people, it is not profitable to build houses for poor people. That’s the challenge.”The opposition National party’s finance spokeswoman Amy Adams said the foreign buyer’s ban was “xenophobic”, and said it had already sent a chill through the international business investment community, with business confidence falling to its lowest level since 2008.“The government has put this up as some sort of panacea to the issue of housing affordability in New Zealand, but the evidence is that it is likely to make the problem far worse,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3597501.1534354952!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brian mooney i m disappointed with leaving results what are my options","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn alternative option for students who have failed to meet entry requirements for their chosen courses may be to apply to their local further education (FE) college. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienFrom early morning, yesterday the queries poured into the  helpdesk, where our team of guidance counsellors answered questions in our live blog.Many readers who contacted the team of guidance counsellors were unsure whether they could include the new H7 (39-30 per cent) grade in their points calculation.Their answer is they can, if it is among their best six grades. It’s worth a total of 37 CAO points .In the case of those who sat the Leaving Cert in previous years and are now calculating their CAO score for the purposes of next Monday’s offers, a score of 33 CAO points applies to all E grades under the old system.(The justification for the lesser points score is because an E grade under the previous system applied to a grade between 39-25 as opposed to the new H7 10 per cent band).The largest group of disappointed students seeking our support were some of the 3,000-plus who had failed to secure 40 per cent on the ordinary level maths paper. This excludes them from consideration by many colleges, who require this grade as a minimum entry requirement for most of their courses.Unfortunately, there is no simple solution to their dilemma. In a small number of colleges, special maths exams are been offered to ordinary level students in the coming days, to those who failed to meet the required grade yesterday (see details below).These students, along with thousands of others who are unhappy with a grade they secured in the Leaving Cert, can also review their scripts on the weekend Friday August 31st-Saturday September 1st. They must be present to view scripts.If they consider it worthwhile, they may then apply to have their exam scripts remarked at a cost of €40, the results of which will be available in mid-October.If they are upgraded (which about 20 per cent are each year) they will be retrospectively offered a place on the course.As many courses are half-way through the first term of lectures by this stage, many students who are successful choose to defer their place into 2019.An alternative option for students who have failed to meet entry requirements for their chosen courses may be to apply to their local further education (FE) college to study a programme in their area of career interest. This may also bypass the need to repeat the paper in 2019.They might also consider registering with the State Examinations Commission in the autumn to sit the subject again in June 2019 and prepare for it alongside whatever else they choose to do this year.You can combine Leaving Certificates for the purposes of meeting course entry requirements, but not for points.There is a further group of students who have not failed maths, but who have not met the entry requirements for admission to a range of engineering and other programmes.These colleges are offering special maths exams to enable these students to have a second attempt to meet the required higher-level grade. To book a place on any of these courses contact the colleges directly today. They include:CIT (August 21st): Applicants for any of their courses may sit two papers, one at ordinary level and a second one for those requiring a higher maths standard.Maynooth University (August 21st): Electronic Engineering for those who did not secure a H4.

Overall, some 57,000 students received their results on Wednesday. Students collected their results from their schools from 9am or online by visiting the State Examinations Commission website from midday.Liam Mariga (18) from Gortroe near Youghal, Co Cork, was convinced there was a misprint when he opened his Leaving Cert results envelope to find he achieved eight H1s.“I went around to the back of the school to open it on my own… My first thought was, ‘surely there’s a mistake’,” says Mariga, a student at Midleton College, Co Cork.“To be honest, I wasn’t expecting anything like that at all. I was in shock.” It was a particularly big day for the Mariga household: he is one of triplets who all received their results today. He now hopes to study medicine at Trinity College Dublin. His brother Cathal plans to study veterinary science, while his sister Katie has enough points to become a school teacher.“To be fair, my mother was good at getting us to study and putting the shoe down when it was needed,” says Mariga. “I also had some amazing teachers who were incredibly supportive.”The secret of his success, he says, was simple: paying attention in class, working solidly throughout the year and not letting study take over his life.He found time to captain the school hockey team, train two or three times a week and hang out with his friends.“It’s important to relax and not get too stressed. You can burn yourself out,” says Mariga. “I love playing hockey so I never thought about giving it up.”Edward Gash, principal of Midleton College, said: “We’re delighted for Liam and very proud of all the students here… he worked consistently through fifth and sixth year and had a very balanced approach to school life.” Andres Clarke secured a birthday to remember when his eight H1s arrived on the day he turned 18.“My first reaction was literally the word ‘Wow!’,” he says of opening his results envelope with fellow classmates at his Oatlands College in Dublin’s Mount Merrion. He plans to study biology at Trinity College Dublin and has now easily secured the requisite points. From there he will take some time to consider the future, he says, but his prospects are obviously bright. Andres’s approach to effective studying will be a comfort to those coming behind him. “What worked for me was to maintain a healthy social life and make sure you have outlets where you can just tune out and forget about all the studying,” he says. “I would say if there is a key to success for me it’s being able to forget about it all for a while.” Another student who got eight H1s, Alex Burke, is planning to study medicinal chemistry at UCD after becoming interested in cancer research when he saw a member of his extended family go through it. Alex from Montenotte in Cork city, who is a student at Christian Brothers College, (CBC) said he fell in love with chemistry at a young age and wanted to apply his knowledge in order to assist sick people. “I was always interested in chemistry and I always wanted to do something to help people. I was always interested in cancer research. I fell in love with chemistry from day one here in school and then I thought about ways to apply it.Then when you see illnesses with family members or things like that it is kind of an inspiring way to think of how could I use chemistry in a way to help people. I had a family member (with cancer) a few years ago.”Alex told told Cork’s 96FM that he was really surprised when he scored the maximum 625 points. He stressed that the results hadn’t sunk in and that while he was hoping to do well he had exceeded all of his expectations. “It is amazing. I was expecting to do well but not this well. I started from day one in sixth year even in fifth year studying every single day. This was always the ultimate goal so there is a lot of work involved. It is exciting times.” In Thurles, meanwhile, Scott Beaton said it took a few moments for him to process his seven H1 grades. He had only been expecting two or three and opened the envelope quietly on his own “for the nerves”. “I was really happy. I really want to go to Edinburgh University,” said the 17-year-old student from Coláiste Mhuire Co-Ed in the Co Tipperary town. Now that is all but certain. He plans to study Middle Eastern Studies, a “lovely mix” of culture, language and religion that will prime him for a career in humanitarian aid. Scott easily surpassed the required three H1s and three H2s to get there. And the secret to his studious success? “First knowing why you want to do it,” he considers of his regime which included eight hours of study a day over the weekend, punctuated with runs and walking his dog. “I didn’t just want to get a university place I did it because I knew that I could be good at working with people and helping refugees. I was going to do it no matter what.”Dáire Byrne’s eight H1s will propel him straight to a Masters in Mathematics at Edinburgh University and he does not even consider it his strong subject. The 18-year-old from Lucan sat his Leaving Cert at Coláiste Pádraig CBS and says the secret to his stunning results is embracing the education system throughout secondary school, and a dismissal of rote learning. “As if learning is a light that you can turn on and off,” he says of the notion. “To have a love of education...I feel is necessary to truly enjoy it and excel.”Dáire hopes his four-year course in mathematics will help him carve out a career in finance or tech, probably the latter. “Google need mathematicians, as do Apple,” he says, considering the options that right now appear laid out before him. “It is the universal language.” A young Sandymount, Co Dublin, man is in the happy position of being able to accept a place at Pembroke College, University of Oxford after he achieved eight Ard 1s in his Leaving Certificate.Harry Deacon (18) will now study economics and management systems. A former pupil at St Andrew’s College in Booterstown, Dublin, Mr Deacon said his parents were “obviously very, very proud. My mum drove me in for the results and she was probably more nervous than I was”. For himself “it was definitely a surprise” he said although he does admit to working very hard. “I worked through the year with the offer from Oxford so I knew what I had to get but I still was in the school musical and took part in the Model United Nations”. He also kept up his sports, cricket and hockey and remarked “they kept me sane during the year”. Mr Deacon said his family “had a very quiet house this year” as his sister was studying for her Junior Certificate, the results of which are out in a matter of weeks. “Credit to her there was not a sound out of her,” he said, adding that he hoped he would be celebrating her results with her when they come out.

Initially its prime focus will be on genetic samples of thousands of people with MS in Ireland and Britain.One of the most prevalent diseases of the central nervous system, MS directly affects some 9,000 people in Ireland and an estimated 2.5 million people worldwide.It is the most common disabling neurological disorder among young people – especially aged 20 to 30 – and about 250 people are diagnosed with the condition every year in Ireland. It is a notoriously complex disease of the body’s autoimmune system, especially as it affects people in different ways.Genomics Medicine Ireland (GMI), an Irish life sciences company, has signed a collaboration agreement with Prof Stephen Sawcer, a leading neurologist working on genetic aspects of MS who is based at the University of Cambridge’s Addenbrookes Hospital.The analysis of an unprecedented number of samples has been made possible due to major advances in gene technology in particular genetic sequencing – a number of common “genetic variants” influence the risk of MS.GMI has been undertaking large-scale research studies looking at the relationship between genetics, health and disease. It has been working with the medical community patients, academic researchers and the global biotech and pharmaceutical sectors, with a view to developing new treatments and better diagnostics across a spectrum of chronic health conditions.GMI is already undertaking the most comprehensive genomic study of MS to be ever undertaken on the island of Ireland but the agreement enables this to be scaled up, increasingly the possibility of a breakthrough.Cork University Hospital St Vincent’s University Hospital, Dublin Tallaght Hospital, Dublin hospitals in the Western Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland and the Clinical Translational Research Centre at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry are contributing to this study.The agreement with Cambridge University is GMI’s first international collaboration and will determine the whole genome sequence, the genetic make-up, from more than 15,000 “biobanked samples” from MS patients in Ireland and those built up by Prof Sawcer in the UK.Prof Sawcer told The  that new gene technology, which was rapid and inexpensive, enabled a new approach. He stressed the programme was concentrated on genetics as it was far more likely to translate into effective therapies, because “this is the first time that we have actually had incontrovertible evidence” that a particular “genetic snip” (portion of DNA) is relevant.“Prior to that, it was somebody’s best guess, and I cannot emphasis enough just how random that was prior to this work,” Prof Sawcer added. The pharmaceutical industry was fully aware it was far more likely to develop drugs if there was “genetic support” for it, he said.Dr David Kavanagh, director of GMI’s complex diseases programme, said the collaboration was an attempt “to accelerate the path of fundamental discovery to drugs on the market”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ian Elliott, chief executive of church\u0026rsquos child protection body, said his work was resistedWorldwide \u0026lsquothe problem is not managed effectively anywhere\u0026rsquo by the Catholic ChurchMarine biologist\u0026rsquos work celebrated with images and music at Valentia Island lighthouseTeams from Cambridge University and Ireland seek genetic markers for diseaseSuspect linked to remote areas of Wicklow and Carlow-Laois borderNew alliance with Genomics Medicine Ireland a chance to complete unfinished businessUCD\u0026rsquos Futurye crop research looks at ryegrass growth in a warming worldCongratulations all round as adults returning to education get their Leaving resultsHistorian Catherine Corless calls on Pope Francis to make a public apology\u0026lsquoIt is nearly impossible for people to move on from emergency and homeless services\u0026rsquoPresidential candidate tells Carlow councillors he would avoid \u0026lsquomegaphone diplomacy\u0026rsquoThe landmark will be given a voice as part of talking statues initiative for DublinPoor pay and allowances sapping morale, say supportersFianna F\u0026aacuteil says it will consider legislation in SeptemberJack O\u0026rsquoConnor says full discussion on general approach of the left is needed firstRail operator says tickets to Dublin on the day of the event are nearly all sold outAnne Anderson says we \u0026lsquocannot embrace Trumpism\u0026rsquo which is at odds with our valuesEngineers Ireland said industry demand is still outstripping supplyState Examinations Commission to be asked to see if there are \u0026lsquolessons to be learned\u0026rsquoMedical Council report finds interns complained of being belittled"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3597668.1534364793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord putting ireland first in sweltering carlow chamber","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKevin Sharkey and others at Carlow County Council meeting: “Ireland should come first – that’s not to exclude anyone, that just makes common sense.”  Photograph: Dylan VaughanBut really, does it make a blind bit of difference who we install in the Áras for the next seven years?The winner just has to be presidential.It should be a simple process. But it’s far from it.There is a queue of contenders who think they have what it takes to do the presidential thing. The more they expand and expound on their suitability to do the job, the more you wonder. And in some cases, the more you shake your baffled head in wonder.Four potential candidates travelled to Carlow on Wednesday to ask its county councillors to nominate them for a place on the election ticket.Two are serious contenders for a place on the ballot in October, one appears a long shot and the last hasn’t a snowball’s chance in hell.The councillors were polite and welcoming, but they didn’t seem particularly enthusiastic about any of the supplicants who passed their way in the hope of gaining preferment.At the outset, the chairman pointed out there is still time for more hopefuls to come before them and plead their case. “If I was only five years older I’d be eligible to stand as a candidate,” sighed Brian O’Donoghue (FG), “but I’m not.”Later on, one councillor mentioned that “another big name” would be declaring for the race at the weekend, but he didn’t say who this person might be.Nobody in the sweltering chamber bothered to ask.The two front-runners in this yet-to-be-completed field are businessman Gavin Duffy and Senator and mental health campaigner Joan Freeman. Both arrived with an early-day entourage in tow and each was in possession of a PR big hitter. In Duffy’s case, veteran political adviser, media consultant and field sports advocate, Liam Cahill and in Freeman’s case, author and communications consultant, Natasha Fennell.Artist Kevin Sharkey arrived on his own, armed with half a sheet of paper containing his notes. He was very glad of that sheet of paper because he was able to fan himself furiously with it as the heat levels rose.The last person to throw his hat in the ring was a grey-haired man from Galway called Patrick Feeney, who bamboozled the audience with a very convoluted description of his early years and subsequent work history, from becoming “Juvenile Connaught Boxing Champion: 6st-7” to his years in Aer Lingus via the beatification of Oliver J Plunkett and the revival of the beet industry.Among the four candidates who each believe they are eminently qualified to contest the election and win, Feeney is the only one who has ever stood before the people. He got 22 votes in the last general election, although he “always wanted to run for Galway County Council but I couldn’t get in there”.There was major disappointment midway through the afternoon when a fifth declared speaker – Marie Goretti Moylan – failed to show. “She isn’t in the house,” announced the chair, conjuring up thoughts of Elvis.On the day, it was Sharkey who gave the most arresting performance. Although it was Cllr Arthur McDonald (FF) who put the icing on the cake for him.Sharkey began his pitch by talking about growing up in Donegal. “I was the only black child there.” He then explored the question “What is racism?”. His presidency would be “a platform for opening up a conversation that we need to have as adults”.In the question-and-answer session which followed, Cllr McDonald’s query sent eyebrows shooting up and jaws dropping down.“We live in a country where we elected an atheist President. We have a gay Taoiseach. We’ve brought in orce and now we’ve brought in abortion. I just wonder,” he asked Kevin, “Do you feel that it’s time for a coloured president?”Sharkey, who was taken to task by a number of councillors about his references to Ireland being “predominately” white and needing “to have a conversation about immigration”, insisted the colour of his skin had nothing to do with his fledgling campaign.Those who challenged him and pointed to Ireland’s emigrant experience in America were told that the Irish worked hard, whereas workers coming over from Europe now are coming here “for a support system that is very attractive”.Sharkey, who twice reprimanded the media for being “lazy”, is treading what seems a familiar political path in the light of Donald Trump’s success. “Ireland should come first – that’s not to exclude anyone, that just makes common sense.”Could he get four councils to nominate him? It seems unlikely, but nothing is impossible these days. A number of councillors noted afterwards that he is a very good speaker. Indeed, he spoke fluently for 15 minutes – not always making complete sense – with only that tiny sheet of paper to guide him.And so, finally, to Gavin Duffy and Joan Freeman.Both of them shamelessly soft-soaped the Carlovians about their wonderful county and lovely people before setting out their stalls.“I believe I have the necessary experience, energy, integrity and vision to bring a new and invigorated presidency,” said Gavin, who has a “signature initiative” as his USP (unique selling point). This is his president’s international youth corps, where young people will travel Ireland and do “a tour of duty abroad” helping their fellow men and women.Sort of gap-year missionaries, without the religion.Covering all the bases, his presidency will be founded on “five pillars” of Youth, Age, Diversity and Inclusion, Respect and The Economy. Gavin wants to “just put a bit of verve into people”.All the iniduals he has dealt with over the years – from political and business leaders and people in the wider community – have one thing in common: “They have a dream of making a difference.”Not surprisingly, Joan Freeman will host a summit on mental health.She was quietly impressive, not making any big promises. She would focus on and promote issues in the way Mary McAleese spoke of building-bridges presidency and Mary Robinson looked to the dispossessed.“I am accused of being a one-trick pony” she said. “But that trick is very big.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3597456.1534351314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us democrats are rediscovering identity politics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGeorgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is building a coalition of minority voters, topped up with liberal whites. Photograph: Jessica McGowanGetty ImagesThe world did not always notice, so absorbed was it in the fact of his blackness, but Barack Obama sought to de-emphasise race. Had events not forced him into memorable orations on the subject, there is no reason to think he would have given them.Bill Clinton was another US president who saw his nation through the lens of economics rather than blood. It was the outside observer, namely the novelist Toni Morrison, who read racial significance into him. Had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, we would now be well into yet a third technocratic government in as many decades.For all that identity politics has permeated the wider left, the upper reaches of the Democratic party have remained mostly resistant. Some of this is down to a belief that Americans must be addressed as Americans, not as ethnic subsets, as per the ideals of the republic. Some of it is electoral prudence: a party too identified with minorities is asking for trouble with white voters. These two impulses explain the respectful distance between Democrats and the racialised politics of the university campus.Among the legacies of Donald Trump is the narrowing of this distance. Eminent Democrats are embracing race as a cause. Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, calls the criminal justice system “racist”.Kamala Harris, a senator from California and another presidential prospect, resents the term “identity politics”. It belittles the seriousness of race (and gender) inequities, she argues. Georgia’s Stacey Abrams, who could become the first black woman to govern a state, is building a coalition of minority voters, topped up with liberal whites. If it works in November, it could be a template for the national party.After Trump’s election two years ago, Democrats were advised by the likes of Mark Lilla, a professor of humanities at Columbia University, to reject the Balkanisation of the electorate in favour of a universal offering.The most obvious reason why they did not was Trump’s conduct in office. It sapped the Democrats’ belief that race could ever be transcended. If the president’s travel bans and quarrels with black athletes did not demand an explicit defence of minorities, then Charlottesville did.A year has passed since the Virginia town joined Selma and Appomattox as one of those southern place-names that become abstract nouns, denoting racial strife. The president’s equivocal line on far-right violence there persuaded many Democrats that blindness to race, once their ideal, was now a moral abdication. The party had to speak for people who felt besieged, even if it meant distinguishing one kind of American from another.As for the party’s wariness of the white voter, demographic change is easing it. Some Democrats believe the ethnic ersification of certain states, such as Georgia and Arizona, is re-painting them from Republican red to, if not Democratic blue, then the pale mauve of electoral competitiveness.These projections assume rather a lot. And as a political strategy, it also forfeits working-class whites, as though a pitch to them is not worth the discomfort it would cause the metropolitan left. Still, demographics point to a more minority-facing Democratic party.At this point, an old Washington hand will wonder what the fuss is about. There has been a racial pattern to American politics for a long time, with minorities favouring Democrats and Republicans carrying whites. Each party has appealed to its “own”.The difference is that racial politics was, for the most part, implicit. It was a matter of coded language and suggestive television advertisements. At no point did either party stop paying lip service to the ideal of an inisible nation. “They are black, they are white,” said Richard Nixon, even, of his “Silent Majority” in 1968. “They’re native and foreign born.”The new version of racial politics promises to be much more explicit, with each party appealing to ethnic groups in so many words. If this seems implausible, consider how far US politics has changed in just two years.This is the most race-conscious Democratic party since 1988, when Jesse Jackson was briefly frontrunner for its presidential nomination. The change is neither surprising nor necessarily permanent. There was always going to be a counterforce to the blood-and-soil nationalism of the modern right.If the Republicans revert to their pre-Trump ways once he has gone, then the Democrats can go back to the technocratic reticence on race of the Obama-Clinton years. The dread for the republic is that neither reversal ever happens, and the future is fragmentation. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

The biggest issue is the lack of clean drinking water.”Another minority candidate, a Christian woman called Nomi Bashir, had similar complaints in Karachi.“There is no water, we don’t have proper roads and our education system is completely flawed,” she said in a newspaper interview while on the campaign trail.The rough-and-tumble of Pakistan\u0027s politics can be tough for candidates without money or powerful support.Mrs Parmar said she had been intimidated and told to back down.“Yes, there have been instances where I’ve gotten calls telling me to step aside. These feudals that rule over us have tried to pressure me. They’d call at my house and say, \u0027Tell Sunita to step aside\u0027. But I have stepped forward for my community and I will not back down. I’m not alone, I have the entire downtrodden class with me.”On the July 25 polling day she picked up 352 votes. The winner, Fakir Sher Mohammad of the Pakistan People\u0027s Party, picked up nearly 55,000.Perhaps it was fear that stopped her neighbours voting for her, or perhaps they were paid off, she said.I thought more people would vote, I thought I would win,” she told the .“But I still feel happy. I don’t care about win or loss, I’m happy I competed. I met with the people, took part in the process and represented my community.

City boardrooms are short of women in general, and women over 60 are certainly thin on the ground. Most notably, broadcasting has been notoriously shy of giving older women screen time.It was less than\u0026nbsptwo years ago that the head of the regulator\u0026nbspOfcom\u0026nbspaccused the BBC of “not doing as good a job as it should be” in its treatment of older women, after many complaints from viewers about a lack of mature female presenters.The corporation had long faced criticism for its treatment of older women, and lost an age discrimination case brought by Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly, who was sacked in 2009, to make way for younger presenters. \u0026nbspMadonna – career in pictures Madonna on \u0027Saturday Show\u0027, TV ProgrammeMadonna performing in the 80sMadonna in \u0027Desperately Seeking Susan\u0027Madonna and Sean Penn in \u0027Shanghai Surprise\u0027Madonna performing at Wembley StadiumGriffin Dunne and Madonna in \u0027Who\u0027s That Girl\u0027Fans wait for the arrival of Madonna at Heathrow AirportMadonna performs on stage as part of her \u0027Who\u0027s That Girl World Tour\u0027 at Roundhay Park, LeedsMadonna performing on the Blond Ambition Tour in Tokyo, JapanMadonna strikes a pose in her 1990 video for \u0027Vogue\u0027Madonna opening her Blond Ambition World TourThe Launch of the book \u0027Sex\u0027 by MadonnaMadonna performs at the Brit AwardsMadonna is joined by actors Jonathan Pryce and Antonio Banderas in London, as music recording began on the film version of \u0027Evita\u0027Madonna - Ray of Light music videoMadonna and Guy Ritchie leave Dornoch Cathedral after having their baby Rocco ChristenedMadonna with the Best Female award at the MTV Europe Music Awards held at the Globe Arena in StockholmMadonna and British film director Guy Ritchie at the Evening Standard British Film Awards, held at the Savoy Hotel in LondonMadonna with her MTV Award for Best Female Artist, during the MTV Awards ceremony at the Filaforum near MilanMadonna celebrates American Independence Day by kicking off the UK leg of her Drowned World tour with a spectacular show at Earl\u0027s Court in west LondonQueen Elizabeth II meets Madonna at the World premiere of Die another Day, at the Royal Albert HallBritney Spears kissing Madonna at the MTV video music awards in New YorkMadonna at the launch of her first children\u0027s book The English Roses held at the Kensington Roof Gardens, LondonMadonna performs during the London leg of her \u0027re-Invention\u0027 world tourMadonna appears backstage at the MTV Europe Music Awards in LisbonMadonna performing at G.A.Y in London to launch her new album \u0027Confessions On A Dancefloor\u0027Madonna collects her award for Best International Female, on stage at the Brit Awards 2006Madonna performs during her \u0027Sticky and Sweet\u0027 tour at Wembley StadiumMadonna performs during her \u0027Sticky and Sweet\u0027 tour in CardiffMadonna performs at the 2015 Brit Awards in LondonMadonna and fashion designer Riccardo Tisci attend the Manus x Machina: Fashion In An Age Of Technology Costume Institute Gala at politan Museum of Art in New York CityMadonna at the Rei KawakuboComme des Garcons: Art Of The In-Between Met GalaMadonna speaks to the press at a news conference in Blantyre, Malawi.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/02/16/merkel-macron-laugh.jpg  width= 1876  height= 1518  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/02/16/merkel-macron-laugh.jpg","title":"brexit no deal uk leave eu latvia jeremy hunt meeting foreign minister","story":"Created with Sketch.Edgars\u0026nbspRinkevics\u0026nbspwarns of \u0027very considerable risk\u0027 of Britain crashing out of EU without an agreement as he prepares for talks with Jeremy HuntClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: Chances of UK leaving EU with a deal only \u002750:50\u0027, says Latvian foreign ministerThe chances of the UK securing a Brexit deal before it leaves the European Union in\u0026nbspMarch\u0026nbspare only 50:50, Latvia’s foreign minister has said ahead of talks with Jeremy Hunt.Edgars Rinkevics said there was a “very considerable risk” that, with time rapidly running out, Britain could crash out of the bloc without a withdrawal agreement.He will meet Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, in the Latvian capital Riga today, with Brexit high on the agenda.\u0026nbspMr Hunt’s visit is part of a three day trip that will also take in Denmark and the Netherlands. The talks\u0026nbspform part of a concerted effort by UK ministers to convince their European counterparts to support Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which has already been dismissed by the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.The Independent‘s petition to give the public a Final Say on Britain’s future relationship with the EU has now been signed by more than 600,000\u0026nbsppeople.Asked about the prospects of a Brexit deal, Mr\u0026nbspRinkevics\u0026nbsptold BBC\u0026nbspToday:\u0026nbsp“We are at a very critical point.“I believe that both the EU and UK need to have extra effort to reach some kind of deal by October because I believe it is in the best interests of both the EU and UK.”He added: “I think it is only now the British public and British government understand how\u0026nbspcomplex, how difficult\u0026nbspthis kind of Brexit is, and that it\u0026nbspis very difficult to build the future relationship.”Assessing the likelihood of an agreement being reached, he said: “Frankly, at this point I would rate it 50:50 –\u0026nbsp50:50 is a very considerable risk.”He also suggested British attempts to win\u0026nbspEuropean leaders’ support for the Chequers proposals, despite opposition from the European Commission, would not work.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMr Rinkevics said he had “full confidence” that Mr\u0026nbspBarnier “is doing his best”, and that the EU 27 would not “split our position” and begin bilateral talks with the UK.Responding to the comments, Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, said he believed the Chequers plan would form the basis of an agreement with the EU.He said: “None of us want no deal, none of us are working towards that, I think it would be damaging for both this country and the EU.“We’ve got to redouble our efforts to make sure we reach the right agreement this autumn, and that’s why Theresa May has brought forward the Chequers proposals.

It is unclear whether the North Korean leader responded.When Mr Peskov was asked whether the two leaders could meet in Vlaostok, he said the economic forum is\u0026nbsp”open for all the leaders of the region” but said Moscow has “so far” received no confirmation\u0026nbspfrom Pyongyang to indicate Mr Kim\u0026nbspwill attend.Mr Kim also sent a message to Mr Putin, KCNA reported, noting the “valuable tradition” as they “struggled shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy in the arduous anti-Japanese war”, which it said provided the “strong roots” for their diplomatic relations.It was unclear if the message came before or after Mr Putin’s invitation.It comes as North Korea marked its liberation from Japanese rule\u0026nbspwith relatively low-key celebrations.A group of war veterans from the former Soviet Union participated and thousands of people cheered their football team to victory over a South Korean squad in the opening match of an under-15 youth tournament in Pyongyang, which featured players from several countries.People also streamed to statues of the country’s leaders or other monuments to observe the anniversary, as is customary.Escape from North KoreaA hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China. He was a commissioned officer in the Korean People\u0027s Army, and left in his uniform. South Korean intelligence confiscated it, but he persuaded his North Korean military contacts to send him a new one.Jeong Min-woo, 29, poses for a photograph in SeoulKang, 28, who wanted to be identified only by her surname, poses for a photograph in Seoul. The parents of Kang sent out a coat across the Chinese border after she reached the South in 2010. I didn\u0027t ask my mother to send me this coat, said Kang. But she knew I feel the cold easily and sent it to me. She sent some honey too, but it went missing on the way. The coat is made of dog fur. I don\u0027t know what kind of dog. In 2010, it cost about 700,000 North Korean won ($88 at the unofficial rate). It was really expensive. A North Korean friend went to China to pick it up for me. I liked this coat when I got it. I thought my mother must\u0027ve spent quite a lot of money on it.  The dog fur coat belonging to Kang, My father was a party officer. Our family had a car and we lived in a special apartment. Ordinary people couldn\u0027t afford to wear this kind of coat, not even soldiers. Commissioned officers could afford them. Border guards would wear them. It wasn\u0027t easy to buy this kind of coat, but as time went on, fake ones began to appear. The state often clamped down on this item. It\u0027s technically military supplies so the state monitored people who altered the design of the coat. I know just from looking at this coat that it\u0027s a counterfeit one, not the official version. The counterfeit ones look quite different from the original ones. Military officials preferred the fakes to the original because the design looked much better. The children of rich families would wear them. I look too chubby in this, so don\u0027t wear it here. I thought I could probably wear it if I altered it.Lee Oui-ryuk is from Onsong, near the border with China. He defected in 2010, and brought his ID card with him. I brought my ID with me when I left North Korea. Juche 95.11.7 (the date in the North Korean calendar, which equates to Nov. 7, 2006) is the date I was issued with my ID. It says here my blood type is A, but I\u0027m actually an O. For the 23 years I lived in North Korea, I thought my blood type was A. They wrote down my blood type without even doing a test. They just wrote whatever they wanted to. I was caught trying to defect to South Korea around Kim Jong Il\u0027s birthday. They strengthen border security just before and after that date.The bottom of the lamp is dark, as the saying goes, and I thought I\u0027d be able to cross right under their noses. The soldiers shot at me as I tried to run away from the Tumen River. I managed to get away and hid, but someone reported me and I was caught. That\u0027s when I was taken to the bowibu (North Korean secret police) for three months of interrogation. The state ruled that I had tried to defect to South Korea, and I was sent to a camp for political prisoners. I escaped when they were transferring me to the camp. I hid and managed to make it to my big sister\u0027s house - that\u0027s when I grabbed these photos. I couldn\u0027t go home easily, so decided I had to hide in the mountains or somewhere remote. I needed my ID to move around without getting caught. and I took these 12 photos with me in case I wanted to look back and reminisce. I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why. She said that after I had left, she moved in with her father in Pyongyang and had been cooking for him. She said she decided to become a chef so she could fulfill my role at home. I was sad when I heard that.Lee Min-bok, 60, was a researcher at North Korea\u0027s Academy of Agricultural Science. He first tried to defect, unsuccessfully, in 1990. He eventually left North Korea in June 1991 and came to South Korea in 1995. His family sent him these diaries. I have a bit of an academic side. According to Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, people are supposed to keep diaries. Everyone in North Korea should strictly follow Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, so I did as I was supposed to and kept a diary. Even though Kim Il Sung is a villain here, in North Korea he\u0027s above everything. We learned that he studied well and gave our lives purpose. I lived according to those teachings. I wrote these out of loyalty to the Leader. That was our ideology, and I lived my life in strict adherence to it. No one could think differently.I got hold of these diaries 10 years after I arrived in South Korea. I had been sending money to my family in the North and they sent them to me. I didn\u0027t write any complaints in diaries. I would\u0027ve been in big trouble if I did. My diaries are a record of my history in North Korea. I am thinking about turning these diaries into a book. I\u0027d like to publish a book about how to change North Koreans\u0027 thinking when unification happens. These diaries show how North Koreans think and how their minds are constructed. People need to make these into a textbook, because they need proof. Talking is not as effective.Song Byeok was a propaganda artist. His father drowned trying to cross the Tumen river, in 2000. When the artist finally left North Korea in 2001, he brought photos of his family with him. We left that August to find food, Byeok recalled, describing the first attempt. We were from a town further inland, and we weren\u0027t sure where the river was high and where it was low. I didn\u0027t know at the time but the river was swollen because of the rainy season. I thought we had to cross it anyway. All I could think about was getting to China to buy food. I took off my clothes and tied them into a rope to strap us together. I told my father not to let go. As we approached the middle of the river, the strap felt lighter. I looked back and saw my father drifting away. I was devastated.He was going under the water and couldn\u0027t get out. I rushed up to the (North Korean) border guards and asked them to save him but they just said why did I come out, why didn\u0027t I die too. They handcuffed me and took me away. It was Aug. 28. I was tortured by the bowibu (North Korean secret police) in Hoeryong, then jailed for four months in Chongjin prison camp. But after I was released from the camp I felt like I needed to survive and carry on living. Right before I tried to defect again, I went back home and grabbed my family photos. Even if I died trying, I thought, at least I would have this picture with me. I never found my father. After I came to South Korea, I went back to China in 2004 and held a memorial service for him by the river. My heart still aches.Baek Hwa-sung, 33, left Sinuiju, on the border with China, in 2003 and resettled in South Korea in 2008. He kept a diary as he defected. In 2004, I started to write down all my thoughts in a diary. I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get caught. I just wanted to let it be known where I was from, and where I wanted to go. After I left the North, I became very depressed, hiding in the mountains alone for a while. The people who were watching over me told me not to come down to the village and left me by myself in a mountain shelter. Alone, with no one to engage with or talk to, I felt like I would go insane. So I wanted to leave something behind in case I died there or got caught - that\u0027s why I started to write.Alone in the mountains, I desperately sought something to talk to. That was my diary. My diaries are proof of my life\u0027s journey. I read them when I want to remember home. I can\u0027t return home, and I already have no memories of my hometown. But when I go through my diaries, there are notes which detail the vivid memories of that time. Sometimes I might forget my father\u0027s birthday, but when I go back to my diary, his birthday and my mother\u0027s birthday are there. My diaries are a record of my life. They prove I\u0027m alive.A hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China.

I thought my mother must\u0027ve spent quite a lot of money on it.  The dog fur coat belonging to Kang, My father was a party officer. Our family had a car and we lived in a special apartment. Ordinary people couldn\u0027t afford to wear this kind of coat, not even soldiers. Commissioned officers could afford them. Border guards would wear them. It wasn\u0027t easy to buy this kind of coat, but as time went on, fake ones began to appear. The state often clamped down on this item. It\u0027s technically military supplies so the state monitored people who altered the design of the coat. I know just from looking at this coat that it\u0027s a counterfeit one, not the official version. The counterfeit ones look quite different from the original ones. Military officials preferred the fakes to the original because the design looked much better. The children of rich families would wear them. I look too chubby in this, so don\u0027t wear it here. I thought I could probably wear it if I altered it.Lee Oui-ryuk is from Onsong, near the border with China. He defected in 2010, and brought his ID card with him. I brought my ID with me when I left North Korea. Juche 95.11.7 (the date in the North Korean calendar, which equates to Nov. 7, 2006) is the date I was issued with my ID. It says here my blood type is A, but I\u0027m actually an O. For the 23 years I lived in North Korea, I thought my blood type was A. They wrote down my blood type without even doing a test. They just wrote whatever they wanted to. I was caught trying to defect to South Korea around Kim Jong Il\u0027s birthday. They strengthen border security just before and after that date.The bottom of the lamp is dark, as the saying goes, and I thought I\u0027d be able to cross right under their noses. The soldiers shot at me as I tried to run away from the Tumen River. I managed to get away and hid, but someone reported me and I was caught. That\u0027s when I was taken to the bowibu (North Korean secret police) for three months of interrogation. The state ruled that I had tried to defect to South Korea, and I was sent to a camp for political prisoners. I escaped when they were transferring me to the camp. I hid and managed to make it to my big sister\u0027s house - that\u0027s when I grabbed these photos. I couldn\u0027t go home easily, so decided I had to hide in the mountains or somewhere remote. I needed my ID to move around without getting caught. and I took these 12 photos with me in case I wanted to look back and reminisce. I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why. She said that after I had left, she moved in with her father in Pyongyang and had been cooking for him. She said she decided to become a chef so she could fulfill my role at home. I was sad when I heard that.Lee Min-bok, 60, was a researcher at North Korea\u0027s Academy of Agricultural Science. He first tried to defect, unsuccessfully, in 1990. He eventually left North Korea in June 1991 and came to South Korea in 1995. His family sent him these diaries. I have a bit of an academic side. According to Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, people are supposed to keep diaries. Everyone in North Korea should strictly follow Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, so I did as I was supposed to and kept a diary. Even though Kim Il Sung is a villain here, in North Korea he\u0027s above everything. We learned that he studied well and gave our lives purpose. I lived according to those teachings. I wrote these out of loyalty to the Leader. That was our ideology, and I lived my life in strict adherence to it. No one could think differently.I got hold of these diaries 10 years after I arrived in South Korea. I had been sending money to my family in the North and they sent them to me. I didn\u0027t write any complaints in diaries. I would\u0027ve been in big trouble if I did. My diaries are a record of my history in North Korea. I am thinking about turning these diaries into a book. I\u0027d like to publish a book about how to change North Koreans\u0027 thinking when unification happens. These diaries show how North Koreans think and how their minds are constructed. People need to make these into a textbook, because they need proof. Talking is not as effective.Song Byeok was a propaganda artist. His father drowned trying to cross the Tumen river, in 2000. When the artist finally left North Korea in 2001, he brought photos of his family with him. We left that August to find food, Byeok recalled, describing the first attempt. We were from a town further inland, and we weren\u0027t sure where the river was high and where it was low. I didn\u0027t know at the time but the river was swollen because of the rainy season. I thought we had to cross it anyway. All I could think about was getting to China to buy food. I took off my clothes and tied them into a rope to strap us together. I told my father not to let go. As we approached the middle of the river, the strap felt lighter. I looked back and saw my father drifting away. I was devastated.He was going under the water and couldn\u0027t get out. I rushed up to the (North Korean) border guards and asked them to save him but they just said why did I come out, why didn\u0027t I die too. They handcuffed me and took me away. It was Aug. 28. I was tortured by the bowibu (North Korean secret police) in Hoeryong, then jailed for four months in Chongjin prison camp. But after I was released from the camp I felt like I needed to survive and carry on living. Right before I tried to defect again, I went back home and grabbed my family photos. Even if I died trying, I thought, at least I would have this picture with me. I never found my father. After I came to South Korea, I went back to China in 2004 and held a memorial service for him by the river. My heart still aches.Baek Hwa-sung, 33, left Sinuiju, on the border with China, in 2003 and resettled in South Korea in 2008. He kept a diary as he defected. In 2004, I started to write down all my thoughts in a diary. I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get caught. I just wanted to let it be known where I was from, and where I wanted to go. After I left the North, I became very depressed, hiding in the mountains alone for a while. The people who were watching over me told me not to come down to the village and left me by myself in a mountain shelter. Alone, with no one to engage with or talk to, I felt like I would go insane. So I wanted to leave something behind in case I died there or got caught - that\u0027s why I started to write.Alone in the mountains, I desperately sought something to talk to. That was my diary. My diaries are proof of my life\u0027s journey. I read them when I want to remember home. I can\u0027t return home, and I already have no memories of my hometown. But when I go through my diaries, there are notes which detail the vivid memories of that time. Sometimes I might forget my father\u0027s birthday, but when I go back to my diary, his birthday and my mother\u0027s birthday are there. My diaries are a record of my life. They prove I\u0027m alive.North Korea has been preparing for an extravagant celebration for its national foundation day on 9 September.The festivities are intended to be a spectacular homage to Mr Kim’s campaign to bolster his country’s image abroad and ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula through diplomacy with its neighbours and the US.Diplomacy with China and Russia appears to be progressing, with reports Chinese tourism to North Korea is already on the rise.But it remains to be seen whether the initially successful negotiations between the north and Washington will progress, after Pyongyang called on Washington to make a stronger effort to build confidence and assure its security before it gives up its nuclear weapons.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/15/16/auckland.jpg","title":"new zealand foreigners home buyers property market ban","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027We\u0027re here to take another step\u0026nbsptoward the\u0026nbspdream of home ownership,\u0027 says ministerClick to followThe Independent OnlineHouse prices have soared in New Zealand recent years, with average costs rising more than 60 per cent nationwide in the last decade and almost doubling in Auckland, the country’s largest city (file photo)New Zealand has banned foreigners from buying homes as part of new efforts to curb skyrocketing housing prices.The government argued the ban would lower the cost of homes, but critics said the new policy risked stifling the economy and would not fix the problem.House prices have soared in New Zealand in recent years, with average costs rising more than 60 per cent nationwide in the last decade and almost doubling in Auckland, the country’s largest city.The cost of housing in New Zealand is among the highest in the world when compared with people’s incomes.\u0026nbspHome ownership in New Zealand is at its lowest level since 1951, with only a quarter of adults possessing a property, and the last five years has also witnessed a rise in homelessness. In the UK, just over 60 per cent of adults own a home.\u0026nbspAlthough statistics indicate only about 3 per cent of New Zealand homes are being sold to foreigners, the amount rises to 5 per cent in the Queenstown region and 22 per cent in central Auckland.Anecdotes about\u0026nbspwealthy foreigners from Silicon Valley buying ranches in picturesque rural New Zealand to “escape” have rankled locals struggling to afford homes. There have also been reports of wealthy Chinese investors buying large numbers of property in Auckland.The Overseas Investment Amendment Bill passed its final reading in parliament on Wednesday in Wellington and will take effect within two months of receiving formal approval from the\u0026nbspGovernor General, New Zealand’s symbolic head of state.“We’re here today to take another step toward restoring the great New Zealand dream of home ownership,“ said associate finance minister David Parker.He said it was the birthright of New Zealanders to buy homes at a fair price.\u0026nbspJacinda Ardern announces new measures to tackle homelessness in New Zealand“This government believes that New Zealanders should not be outbid by wealthier foreign buyers,” Mr Parker said.“Whether it’s a beautiful lakeside or oceanfront estate, or a modest suburban house, this law ensures that the market for our homes is set in New Zealand, not on the international market.”\u0026nbspThere are some exceptions to the ban. Foreigners with New Zealand residency status\u0026nbspwill still be able to buy houses, as will people from Australia and Singapore, due to existing free-trade agreements.\u0026nbspForeigners who already own homes in New Zealand will also not be affected by the new law, while overseas buyers will still be able to own up to 60 percent of units in large, newly built apartment buildings.Last month, the International Monetary Fund urged New Zealand to reconsider the ban, saying they thought it unlikely to improve the affordability of housing.It also warned the move could discourage foreign investment needed to build new homes, even after the government relaxed the proposals to address such concerns.An earlier draft ban did not allow foreigners to own a percentage of apartments in newly built blocks.World news in picturesIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi greets schoolchildren after his speech as part of India\u0027s 72nd Independence Day celebrations which marks the 71st anniversary of the end of British colonial rule, at the Red Fort in New DelhiA large section of the Morandi viaduct upon which the A10 motorway runs collapsed in Genoa, Italy.

Government forces have set their sights on retaking the south of the country, a strategic area that borders Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan HeightsViktoria Neligan, who signed the petition, commented: “Having suffered a miscarriage it would have been nice to have my husband home to support me, and me him”.At present, New Zealand employees get bereavement leave for a minimum of three days for losing a spouse or partner, parent, child, sibling, grandchild, grandparent and a spouse or partner’s parent.The country’s Ministry of Health says miscarriages are “fairly common” – with one or two out of every 10 pregnant women\u0026nbspmiscarrying a baby.In Britain, a miscarriage before the end of the 24th week of pregnancy does not qualify for bereavement leave, but a stillborn child who is born after this date makes the mother eligible to maternity leave and associated pay.Ruth Bender Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association here in the UK, welcomed the proposed bill. \u0026nbsp“I think some people will be really grateful for it. For many women and their partners, a miscarriage means the loss of a baby and the hopes and the dreams for that child,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“It would give people the time out you need when you have been bereaved. It acknowledges a miscarriage is a significant event and this is even true for people who don’t take the leave.”She said the discussion the proposed bill had provoked\u0026nbspwas helping to reduce the taboo which surrounds miscarriages.\u0026nbspSome other countries have provisions for paid leave if a woman miscarries. Indian law instructs that women are eligible to six weeks’ leave if they miscarry a baby. However, the overwhelming majority of employees in the country carry out informal work so not many are entitled to it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/15/20/yekaterina-milanovskaya.jpg","title":"russia rally anarchists revolution plot putin new greatness","story":"Created with Sketch.Demonstrators carry toys owned by\u0026nbsptheir sons and daughters – highlighting the ages of some of those who have been arrestedClick to followThe Independent OnlineYekaterina Milanovskaya was one of those who attended the rallyHundreds of Russians braved lightning storms and potential arrest to take part in an unsanctioned rally protesting the controversial imprisonment of a group of young anarchists. \u0026nbspThe anarchists, who called themselves “the New Greatness”, are alleged to have plotted to violently overthrow the Russian system. But details of the case are\u0026nbspmurky.From meetings in McDonald’s, the group is alleged to have agreed on a revolution via social media and leafleting. Police arrested 10\u0026nbspmembers of the group in March.The rally in Moscow’s central New Pushkin Square\u0026nbspstyled itself as a “mothers’ march”. Huddled under umbrellas, the mostly female protesters carried toys of their sons and daughters. Some carried unicorns in\u0026nbspreference to the “My Little Pony” that\u0026nbspAnna Pavlikova,\u0026nbspthe youngest of the imprisoned anarchists, loved to collect. But with political messages banned, it also\u0026nbspwas the protesters’ way of identifying each other and avoiding arrest.\u0026nbsp“This is my son’s little tiger,” said Yekaterina Milanovskaya, 40, holding up an orange soft toy. “We bought it for him on his first new year. He’s 14 now,\u0026nbspall brave and happy. But it doesn’t take much to imagine him getting involved in\u0026nbspa little mutiny somewhere, and getting\u0026nbsparrested. That’s what authorities are doing. They want\u0026nbspto scare people like me, to keep the\u0026nbspkids from protesting.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJournalist Anna Narinskaya, one of the organisers of the\u0026nbspprotest, told The Independent that the rally’s aims\u0026nbspwere two-fold: to bring attention to the “injustice” of the case and to demand the release the two youngest members of the group, who are\u0026nbspsuffering from serious ill-health. Anna Pavlikova, now 18,\u0026nbsphas lost part of her hearing, and Maria Dubovik,19, has a tumour. Both also\u0026nbspsuffer from panic attacks.\u0026nbsp“We are against the whole absurd case, but even on the government’s own terms as they present to us, the treatment of these girls goes beyond the humane,” she said. “This protest has been organised by mothers for mothers. We understand that all of our children are at risk. Any of them could be tricked into something like this.”\u0026nbspThe existence of the opposition movement seems to have come as a surprise to everyone except Russia’s law enforcement.\u0026nbspThe group is alleged to have undertaken weapons training ahead of a revolutionary campaign. But the main sources of the evidence are security officers who infiltrated their network. At least one played a significant role in directing the group’s activities.\u0026nbspAccording to supporters and\u0026nbsplawyers acting for the youngsters, the actions of security services amounted to an illegal act of provocation. They say the security agents were instrumental in pushing the group to greater militancy.\u0026nbsp“They invented the revolution themselves and then found people to fill the gaps,” says organiser Ms Narinskaya.\u0026nbspAhead of the rally, police warned that participation\u0026nbsprisked fines and arrests. As per Russia’s controversial protest laws, any political gathering requires permission from local authorities. Opposition actions are rarely granted permission without long delays, or locations away from the city centre. As a result, organisers\u0026nbspdid not even try to get permission. They were issued with official warnings the morning of the rally.\u0026nbspA few hours before the start of the march, authorities raised hopes that they may pull back from their\u0026nbsphardline position. Russia’s State Investigation Committee announced that it had requested Russia’s court authorities change Maria Dubovik and Anna Pavlikova’s detention conditions from prison to home arrest.\u0026nbspThe development was hailed by some as a victory for people power. But activist and prison expert Olga Romanova urged caution, saying that the move was probably designed to wrongfoot activists. \u0026nbspWorld Cup brings village community closer in RussiaChildren play soccer on a pitch next to a school in the village of AlexandrovkaIrina Aleekseva prepares a meal in the kitchen of her home A children\u0027s playground stands in front of a statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir LeninA farmer holding a television remote waves from the front gate of his home during half-time of the World Cup game between France and ArgentinaJaroslav Aleeksev sits on a bed in his grandmother\u0027s home Goal post stands in an overgrown soccer fieldIrina Aleekseva pulls a goat out of her vegetable patch An outdoor toilet stands in a field Children kick soccer balls as they warm-up in front of the statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir LeninIrina Aleekseva checks the honey in the bee hives at the back of her homeChildren play soccer on a pitch next to a school in the village of AlexandrovkaIrina Aleekseva prepares a meal in the kitchen of her home A children\u0027s playground stands in front of a statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir LeninA farmer holding a television remote waves from the front gate of his home during half-time of the World Cup game between France and ArgentinaJaroslav Aleeksev sits on a bed in his grandmother\u0027s home Goal post stands in an overgrown soccer fieldIrina Aleekseva pulls a goat out of her vegetable patch An outdoor toilet stands in a field Children kick soccer balls as they warm-up in front of the statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir LeninIrina Aleekseva checks the honey in the bee hives at the back of her homeWriting in Facebook, she said investigators were able to change terms of the arrest without permission from the courts.\u0026nbsp“You can imagine that other people phoned the judge and recommended what the decision should be,” she wrote. “They are our judges, investigators and prosecutors mixed together in one flask.”\u0026nbspThe decision on the girl’s future will be become clear tomorrow, Thursday, in a\u0026nbspmorning session of\u0026nbspMoscow’s Dorogomilovsky court.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/15/16/Gaza-crossing-Israel.jpg","title":"israel gaza palestine crossing boarder truce talks kerem shalom","story":"Created with Sketch.Fuel, construction material and goods passed through Kerem\u0026nbspShalom crossing, easing pressure on Gaza\u0027s 1.8 million population\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineTrucks full of goods depart from the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom cargo crossing with Israel in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, on WednesdayIsrael has reopened its only goods crossing to Gaza and expanded the enclave’s fishing zones, easing a crippling blockade on the besieged strip as truce talks press ahead.\u0026nbspConsignments of fruit\u0026nbspand vegetables, fuel and construction material moved into Gaza on Wednesday morning through\u0026nbspKerem\u0026nbspShalom crossing, a lifeline for Gaza’s 1.8 million residents.

with the marks needed for top grades lowered to prevent a massive fall in results this summer.Each exam board has its own grade boundary.Ucas is a service that allows students to follow their university application online.The Track became available from 8am on Thursday, August 1, 2018, updating records for each applicant.Students do not see their A-level results through the service, instead they receive them from their school or college.Despite the myth, Track does not update at midnight before the release of the results.More than 40 advisers will be on hand for the expected influx of thousands of learners who receive unexpected results and need support and guidance on what to do next.If you’ve received your exam results (A-levels, GCSEs, Scottish Highers and Standards) and need advice on what to do next, call the Exam Results Helpline for free, independent advice on 0800 100 900.Students are able to use clearing to find out what courses still have places remaining.If students have not been successful with their first preference, they are able to search for a course against the subject they are interested in, or the university they want to head to.All results will be sent to schools or colleges electronically on Wednesday, August 22.The date students will be able to receive their grades is on Thursday, August 23.This year will be the second time the numbers-based grading system will be used, with English and maths students getting a score from 1-9 rather than U-A*.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Low-paid workers, who need their cars and vans for work, will be unfairly hit.So will ordinary, hard-pressed families, who already have to budget to fill up so they can take their kids to school and transport their weekly supermarket shop.In other words, it will unfairly impact the “Just About Managings” who Theresa May once claimed she would strive to protect.Philip Hammond might regard drivers as a convenient cash cow to fill the Treasury’s coffers.But he should resist clobbering them for a quick cash injection.

How many traditional Labour voters today share his worldview?It is Boris, derided by his enemies as an Etonian toff, who has his finger on the nation’s pulse and understands the concerns of ordinary people.No surprise that in one poll the Tories have opened a four-point lead over Corbyn’s Labour.After a short summer break following our fantastic World Cup, it is great to have the beautiful game back.We’ve already witnessed breathtaking goals, crunching tackles and some blinding saves.And there is nowhere better to get the best football coverage than inside Britain’s favourite newspaper.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Don’t they know many thousands of people agree with him? Or do they chose to again ignore the people of this country? Any movement on Boris from the out-of-touch Government will cost them dear.SO Dominic Grieve has threatened to quit Parliament if Boris Johnson became PM. I can think of no better reason for wishing him success.BANG on Boris, about the burka. It being worn in public is scary for children who see it.FREEDOM of speech must not be compromised – and there can be no question of legal action being taken against Boris Johnson, it would be prejudiced by all the attacks on him.THIS week it has been especially hard to be a Muslim woman. Apparently I am not getting the joke, I’m over sensitive, bullied, oppressed, unintegrated, politically motivated, dividing Britain – this list goes on. Perhaps Boris Johnson’s Etonian education did not enable him to understand that in polite society it’s rude to comment with ridicule on the way people dress.ONE thing critics of Boris Johnson’s burka comment overlook is the impact of burka-wearers on those who are deaf and rely on seeing facial expressions, and lip-reading.THE do-gooders complaining about Boris are fanning the flames of hatred by highlighting issues that one wouldn’t really think about. Talk about “integration” appears to be one-sided and discriminatory towards the indigenous people. There is some equilibrium lacking in our “fair, just and equal” land of ours.WHILE I am not sure Boris used a good choice of words likening women in burkas to pillar boxes, he was right that we are frightened by what it represents. We must not destroy Boris, he is good for the people of this country, he cares. He must also be allowed to speak honestly, he has nothing to apologise for.LIGHTEN up, Boris spoke the thoughts of many millions of Brits. If making a gaffe was against the law, Prince Philip could have been banged up in the Tower of London on many occasions during the last 50 years. He wrote the book on it.Boris might have an agenda – what politician doesn’t? – but this mustn’t mean people don’t have a right to voice criticism. Face veils in public, and burkas, are not religious requirements and we must have the right to criticise the wearers.IF I was Boris Johnson, I would agree to attend the diversity training some have suggested . . . and then tear the training session to pieces.I SAW Ranvir Singh berating her guests on morning TV for daring to agree with Boris Johnson? I wonder what her bosses would say if she suggested that she presented her programme wearing a burka. I think we all know the answer to that.PHIL GROWDENNOTHING Theresa May says can be taken at face value. Not so long ago, she promised to stop the witch-hunt of British soldiers, who have seen action and survived in many parts of the world. However, the victimisation of our veterans continues unabated. They are now joined by Boris Johnson, who has frequently ignited the Prime Minister’s wrath and must therefore, be thrown to the wolves.A BUS company has apologised after a driver told a woman to remove her niqab. So would a bank apologise if a security guard asked a man to remove his ski mask?HOW would I stand as a Christian male finding a Muslim lady, dressed in a burka, having a heart attack? Would I be allowed to remove her veil to perform mouth-to-mouth?THE controversy surrounding Boris Johnson’s burka comments has reached ridiculous heights. Police conducting an investigation. Really?IF Theresa May had the guts to ban the burka like a lot of other countries, we might not be having this discussion about what Boris Johnson said.SOMETHING featureless with a rectangular hole in it can resemble a letter box, there’s probably one on your front door, go and have a look. It has also been known for the person inside to be a terrorist, not an innocent woman. Stop being so pathetic, have a sense of humour, act like adultsI READ about a motorcyclist at a filling station having to remove his crash helmet while a woman (who could have been a criminal’s getaway driver) filling up at the pump next to him was wearing a burka. Meanwhile Boris’s remarks are causing hysteria.I HAVE been visiting garden centres and supermarket car parks in my car, which is bedecked with Brexit stickers, asking many people their opinion on the Boris situation. For Boris, I find there is a great deal of love out there. For the Chequers “deal” there is none.IT’S true that Boris Johnson has used strong language but Muslim terrorists are doing far worse things than robbing banks, by committing terrorist atrocities. It would be a sad day when the Muslim community can’t take such a comment, especially when many Muslim women, in my view, do not want this clothing themselves.IT’S confirmed, lunatics are ruining the country. We have the enemy (EU) knocking art the door and all the idiots can find to discuss is Boris Johnson’s perfectly fair comment. If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny. Brexit should be top of the agenda.THERE are easily as many people who agree with BoJo’s comments as those who don’t. So why is it those who don’t will instigate an investigation, leaving those who do without a voice? Even senior Muslims and imams have said that the burka is not a requirement in Islam, so why is it we only tend to listen to those who are offended?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Last Leg is a television safe space, the authentic voice of the PC establishment and as predictable as the sun rising in the morning.So you knew, long before Friday’s transmission, that they’d be targeting Boris, who is a thousand times funnier and edgier than anyone on this show, in his own way.Nearly a whole working week host Adam Hills and his two mates had to prepare some decent material as well, and this was the best three professional comedians could do.Alex Brooker: “The burka is an item of clothing worn by a human being, the other is a postbox, you f***ing idiot.”Adam Hills: “I’d much rather sit next to a person in burka than a p***k in a suit.”Josh Widdicombe: “Theresa May has only just realised Boris is a t**t, so she should apologise as well.”On and on it went, for 12 minutes and 54 seconds, a figure I mention because I’ve had the clock on this lot, and if you want to know exactly how much of a toss they really give about religious sensitivities then it’s best measured by the fact this series of The Last Leg has devoted just 65 hand-wringing seconds to the anti-Semitic poison infecting the Labour Party.It was crammed hurriedly into the previous episode, which was worth watching just to see Adam Hills describe Corbyn’s handling of this crisis as “a faux pas”, (which isn’t French for “shameful cluster-f***”) and the C4 audience react with evident discomfort because he’d drawn attention to the Labour leader’s failings and, therefore, broken one of comedy’s secret and golden rules.If you doubted these rules exist, incidentally, then ever the virtue-signalling fool, Adam Hills was good enough to spell them out for us on Friday.“Every religion should be open to ridicule . . . but you kind of need to be in the club.“Alex and I can make jokes about disabilities as we’re technically disabled.”Boris, he then explained, can’t make jokes about burkas, ’cos he’s “a white Etonian”, nor could comedy giant Rowan Atkinson defend him, as he was “a white man who lives in Oxford and drives an F1 car”.Even if we ignore the fact he’s assumed that all Muslims are black, something pretty staggering is going on here.For Mary Whitehouse, in all her pearl-clutching glory, never imagined anything quite as Draconian and controlling as this form of satirical Apartheid.Adam Hills has a point, though, when he uses the word “club”. That’s exactly what television comedy has become.A closed, left-wing shop where you don’t even bother joining the audience unless you follow the rigid “Tories and Brexit are evil” party line.This is not creating comedy, it’s policing it, and also the reason why applause has replaced laughter on all those Channel 4 and BBC news satires which have failed to realise there is only one simple rule to be observed when creating these shows: Make it funny, dumbo.I would suggest, at this point, Adam Hills gets off his moral high horse, for once, and gives this “funny” idea a go.But then I could also ask Boris to have a crack at anchoring the British women’s 4x100m relay team to gold at the next Olympics, wearing a burka, and I’d know there was only the remotest chance of one ever happening.Run Boris, run.MEANWHILE, back on Channel 4’s Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox was with the Colombian navy this week and desperate for a look inside one of the incredible home-made submarines they’d confiscated from drug-smugglers.“Is it locked?”“Yes.”And there’ll be more Bafta-worthy action from Foxy and his forward-planning department this week, I’m sure.EVER since it discovered that Danny Dyer was the rightful heir to the English throne, Who Do You Think You Are? has been struggling to find a purpose, or indeed a celebrity, who could see the bigger picture.That special someone who would acknowledge history’s great events with more than a few “wows” and shrugs and not think their own career made all of their ancestors’ suffering worthwhile.Finally, last night, they found him.Judge Robert Rinder, who as well as having the best brain at ITV (Luna the Labrador off This Morning has the second best) also turns out to be a natural television journalist, telling the story of his maternal great-grandfather, Israel, and his beloved grandfather, Morris, simply, beautifully and without ever letting the details overwhelm him.The former fled revolutionary Latvia at the turn of the last century.The latter’s entire family was wiped out in Treblinka’s gas chambers.Yet he somehow survived the Buchen-wald, Theresienstadt and Schlieben concentration camps and made it to Britain, which offered him salvation, friendship, justice and, above all, a sense that “life is worth living” that has been passed down through eternally grateful generations.It’s a remarkable story, so if you missed it, try to catch tonight’s repeat (BBC1, 11.25pm).SCENES and characters the viewers are unlikely to forget in a hurry on the final episode of BBC2’s wonderful Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.First stop, the President’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, where Ed spent the most uncomfortable night of his life, since Strictly, at a one-year-in-office party for Trump, with Toni Holt Kramer and a group of fans who were called The Trumpettes, but could well have been the provisional wing of The Golden Girls.If you thought they were a bit sinister, though, he was then off squirrel hunting in the forests of Georgia with two hillbillies who might not have been plucking banjos but they certainly had the mad cackling laughs and slightly unsettling line in hospitality.“Are you ready to be a man today, Ed?” asked one, as you began to wonder if he could escape with his dignity intact, let alone blend in with the local gene pool.Then he suddenly reappeared – and this was a masterstroke – wearing a Norwich City scarf.Scrub everything I ever said about Ed Balls.The man’s a diplomatic genius.Sent in by Rob Milner, East Yorkshire. Picture research: Alfie SnellingTHIS Morning, Wednesday:Gok Wan: “Coming up, Ninja nanas, in a minute, John Torode’s in the Lake District at 11.45, and we’ve got the return of the Hawaiian shirt at midday.“First, would you like to live ten years longer?”Ten years?

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If I dont give him a cigarette, my child goes berserk.”Maryati said Rapi began smoking after collecting cigarette butts scattered on the road which older lads lit for him.After that, he began demanding them from his parents who run a food stall which also sells cigarettes, as well as hounding passersby for his daily fix.Maryati said that it had been difficult to ban her child from smoking because he will “cry all day” if he cant smoke.She added: “If Rapi doesnt get cigarettes he cannot sleep. He will start rampaging and crying.“Its expensive, because we have to buy them for him. He likes to do it all day. He can smoke about 40 every day.”The toddler’s dad Misbahudin, 40, said he also smokes but doesnt know why his child started the habit.He added: I cannot say no to him when he asks for a cigarette. I don’t even smoke that often. I only smoke at work.“When my son smokes he likes to have a cup of mochaccino.”The parents said they will take the toddler to see a doctor to try and kick his smoking habit.Indonesia has one of the highest numbers of smokers per population in the world and a growing problem of child smokers.Around nine per cent of the country’s under-18s smoke regularly.In 2010, a two-year-old boy named Ardi Rizal achieved notoriety after it emerged he also would smoke two packets a day, with footage showing him happily smoking cigarettes.Similar footage has also emerged from China in recent years, with one video showing a three-year-old taking several deep drags on a cigarette as if addicted.That was shortly followed by extraordinary footage of a four-year-old boy, also in China, smoking cigarettes while his grandparents laughed and watched."},{"url":null,"title":"voices schizophrenia","story":"But the truth is that Kyle is no killer, the blood splattered all over his clothes was his own, and the voice telling him he was a murderer was actually in his head.Kyle had reached breaking point and slashed his own skull with a knife in a bid to drown out the voice that had been terrorising him for months.One in ten people regularly hear voices that others dont as a result of illnesses like schizophrenia - a mental health condition which affects 220,000 people in the UK- and Kyle is one of them.After a messy break up and losing his job, Kyle tumbled into a bout of depression and began hearing a voice which told him he was worthless and should kill himself.Kyle first heard the voice ten months ago, and since then it has been constantly telling him to jump off buildings and cliffs.I was very, very lost and I think this is why the voice took hold so easily and took control, Kyle says on BBC3 documentary The Voices in My Head.He didnt tell anyone about the voice at first. Instead, he tried to block it out -  using music as a distraction.But after months of torment, Kyle resorted to trying to cut the sinister presence out of his head once and for all.In pure desperation, he took a blade and hacked into his skull just above his right ear - the point where it sounded like the voice was coming from.He passed out from blood loss. When he came to, the voice told him hed killed someone and Kyle believed it.Scared and confused, Kyle told a stranger that hed committed murder, and she called the police.Kyle then ran - fearing hed be locked up - and called his mum.When she found him, he had blood all over his face and had no choice but to confess everything about the voice.He was sent to a mental health ward, where he stayed for a month.Hes now using a combination of medication and therapy to get rid of the voice which has ruined his life - or at least quiet it down - and has a new job as a valet.In many cases, talking with therapists about the origins of voices can help to ease sufferers worries, and many can use the same coping mechanisms as people with anxiety to remain calm during intense episodes.But hell always bear the knife scar on his head, and for many people with schizophrenia, they must live their lives in the knowledge that the voices will never fully go away.Symptoms of schizophrenia can include having muddled thoughts, undergoing behavioural changes, and experiencing hallucinations and delusions.In some people, schizophrenic behaviours start suddenly, while they develop over time for others.Mental health charity Mind says: Some people think hearing voices means someone is dangerous, when voices are actually more likely to suggest that you harm yourself than someone else.Its also important to remember that people have a choice in whether they do what the voices say.The NHS says you should see your GP as soon as possible if you are experiencing the symptoms of schizophrenia.More information is available on the Mind website. Emmalina is sweeping the floor in her kitchen when shes interrupted by a sinister voice.Im going to kill you when you go outside, it says.Nobody else can hear it, but according to Emmalina, its the voice of the devil - a regular presence who torments her at her lowest moments and leaves her too scared to leave the house.Shes been hearing voices since she was eight and talking back to them for the past three years.As well as the devil, she lives with a voice called Katie - her closest friend - and the voice of her mother.Katie helped me get through really tough times when I was younger, Emmalina says.Emmalina endured sexual abuse and bullying in her childhood, and experts say that early trauma is often associated with hearing voices or developing multiple personalities.I wouldnt have got through childhood without Katie, Emmalina says. My life was unbearable.But Katie isnt always supportive of her.Emmalina says that in the past, Katies voice has told her to cut herself and to smash her own wrists with a hammer.The voice also routinely abuses her, calling her a fat b***h while she eats and even filling her head with racial slurs on the rare occasions when she ventures away from home.These days, Emmalina finds it difficult to leave the house at all, thanks to the increasingly frequent influences of the voice she attributes to the devil.Speaking in a sinister, upper-class accent, it routinely tells her that shell be killed if she steps outside.Im going to burn the skin off your bones, it says. Im going to drag you down to hell. Im going to get you.The voices threats have become so debilitating that Emmalina had to leave her job as a nursery assistant, and now relies on a support worker to try and control her condition.Schizophrenia is often misunderstood, and Australian TV show You Cant Ask That recently aired an episode where sufferers address misconceptions about the condition.Sufferers say that taking medication can suppress the voices, but at the height of their illnesses some reported hearing the voices of dead relatives, unborn children and - like Emmalina - the devil.Sandy can hear two voices, one male and one female.“They used to sound really crass in the way they spoke, but in the last 10 years they’ve done elocution, she says on the show.So now my voices abuse me with a posh accent.“They will tell me how evil I am, how disgusting I am, how disgusting I look, how my face is revolting, how if people touch me they will die because I will contaminate them with my oozing evil.”Other schizophrenic episodes have seen sufferers starve themselves - believing they were being told to by the Grim Reaper - and become convinced that theyre the target of government conspiracies.I have this lingering delusion in the back of my mind that Tony Blair has implanted a micro-chip in my left ear to delete my thoughts, Sandy adds.Fellow sufferer Steve adds: I hear voices all the time. Even just sitting here.“In the early days when I was unwell, if I didn’t do what the voices told me to do they would just get louder and louder and louder.For Chaz, the emergence of a voice which she calls Victor almost proved fatal.Victor has been an unwelcome fixture in Chaz life since 2013, but she was too scared of being sectioned to tell anyone about it.The voice heaps constant abuse on her, telling her that she has no right to be alive and that she can end the torment by killing herself.You should die, the voice says, during one particularly nasty outburst. Just die.After eight months of Victors constant goading, Chaz jumped from a bridge.I didnt want to hear it any more and I wanted everything to disappear, she says. I dont really remember being on the bridge.The police shouted my name. I turned towards them, turned back towards the bridge and just stepped off.Today, the former skateboarder is in a wheelchair as the result of the suicide attempt, which left her with a broken foot, two smashed wrists, a fractured pelvis and a fractured sternum.Chaz still hears Victors voice, and it sometimes even teases her about the day she almost died.I put you in a wheelchair, Victor says, and Chaz hears a foul-spirited laugh inside her head.Now, Chaz refuses to let Victor control her life. She writes and recites poetry about her condition to try and drown the voice out, and hopes to find love soon.I know its hard for anyone to be my friend, she says. But I do actually want to meet people. Id like a girlfriend.But its hard to get someone to stay around.

But they were barely 16 miles out when they were tracked down by English Commodore Charles Wager, in command of four British ships including HMS Expedition.Wager’s plan was to seize the San José, the largest ship in the fleet. But before it could be boarded, something went terribly wrong and the San José blew up.Writing in his log, Wager described an explosion so intense that he could feel the heat from his own ship.He wrote: I believe the ship’s side blew out, for she caused a sea that came in our ports.

I was awake and aware when I hit the water.”Someone had to swim out to rescue her before she was taken to the nearby PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver.Ashley Mahree, the girl who recorded and shared the video online, said: “This looks to be almost criminal.”She wrote in the YouTube description: “This could have easily taken a life, and I think this girl needs to be held accountable in some way.”Sun Online has reached out to Taylor and her grandmother for comment.Jordans auntie Kristie Morgan revealed her niece has been physically and emotionally scarred by the fall but she does not wish revenge on her pusher.She said Jordan, who woke up in hospital crying in pain, finally went home on Friday but is suffering panic attacks since plummeting off Moulton Falls Bridge .Another family member told The Sun Online what Taylor did was horrible, but they dont wish anything bad against her.Photos from a GoFundMe page raising money for Jordans recovery showed her lounging against a giant teddy bear with a hospital tag around her wrist.They were worlds apart from the snaps, taken from her hospital bed, which showed Jordan with a neck brace and unsightly scars on her inner thigh and ribs.The crowd-sourcing page claimed the schoolgirl had damaged the lining in her uterus and is constantly in pain.Kristie added: She is really suffering physically and emotionally. She went home last night and woke up crying in pain this morning.She had previously taken to Facebook to demand the police take action against the woman who shoved her.Kristie added: She doesnt wish to seek revenge on her friend. But in my opinion her friend needs to learn a lesson.She could have killed her and it wouldnt be a question at all if she was in trouble for her actions. She would be in jail right now. But that is how Jordan feels.”Her mum told Thoroughbred Daily News that her daughter is lucky not be paralysed or dead.Jordan and her friends had climbed up to the bridge with the intention of jumping but as she stood on the edge, she had second thoughts.Clearly scared as she looked down at the water below, one of her so-called pals gave her an aggressive and abrupt shove in the back.Rather than falling feet first and streamlined, Jordan plunged with her arms and legs flailing wildly before hitting the water with almighty clap.She later told a local website: In midair I think I mightve blacked out... I was awake and aware when I hit the water.Someone had to swim out to rescue her before she was taken to the nearby PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver.One of Jordans sisters, Kaytlin, said she confronted the girl who pushed her on social media, demanding an apology.She told local site KOIN: Friends dont push someone from that high... I was p****d. She pretty much said that she was sorry for doing it and she wouldnt have done it if she knew the outcome.I think the girl that pushed her should have some sort of consequence because you wont learn your lesson if you think you can could do that again and think it will be fine.Ashley Mahree, the girl who recorded and shared the video online, said: This looks to be almost criminal.She wrote in the YouTube description: This could have easily taken a life, and I think this girl needs to be held accountable in some way.Kristie has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for her Jordan’s medical bills.Clark County Fire Chief Ben Peeler confirmed it is illegal to jump from the bridge."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426795051.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"allergic reactions bee sting swollen lips","story":"That’s because these aren’t beauty treatments that have gone too far – they are in fact horrible allergic reactions to bee stings.Wasp and bee stings are really common especially during the warmer months when people are spending more time outdoors.Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction include extreme swelling of the face, lips or throat, as well as breathing difficulties.The swelling usually subsides after a few days – but sufferers are often left looking like they’ve been at the collagen as they wait for the effects to wear off.While an antihistamine and ice pack often help to calm the reaction, they can sometimes require a visit to the emergency room.And while it can be a terribly painful ordeal to go through, some of these people ended up with rather enviable pouts while others ended up looking like botox gone very wrong."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426470022.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"turkey tariffs us imports alcohol tobacco cars","story":"Alcohol tariffs were raised to 140 per cent, while tobacco rose to 60 per cent, and cars rose to 120 percent.Rice and coal were also hit with new tariffs.The lira made modest gains after the move, increasing in value by three per cent, helped along by other measures aimed at stopping foreign investors speculating on the currency.The US-Turkey dispute revolves around jailed evangelical preacher Andrew Brunson, who was arrested on terrorism charges in Turkey 22 months ago.Trump is believed to be taking a hard line because much of his supporter base are evangelicals.The US is threatening further sanctions if Brunson is not released in the coming weeks.Talks between Turkey and the US on Monday night ended in an impasse.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the US of plotting to destabilise the country and pledged to seek new international trading partners.They may have taken their first step this morning, freeing Lieutenant Angelos Mitretodis and Sergeant Dimitris Kouklatzis, two Greek soldiers held on espionage charges for five months.They returned to Greece this morning, and some believe the move was calculated to win favour with Europe as Turkey faces off against Washington.On Monday the lira dipped to its lowest value ever against the US dollar - trading at only just over seven lira to the dollar.The lira was already in a delicate position before Trump slapped harsh sanctions on the Nato-member state - technically a US ally - due to tension over Erdogan’s increasing authoritarianism.President Erdogan described the currency slide as a storm in a teacup and said there was no economic crisis, and the decline was down to an operation against Turkey.During a speech to supporters in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast, Erdogan proposed counter-measures, including a movement away from reliance on the dollar and US markets.There are fears of mass panic in Turkey, with one major bank reportedly blocking customers from opening new foreign exchange accounts, making it harder for people to trade lira for US dollars, pounds and euros.On Monday Erdogan reportedly referred to America as The bullies of the global system.The bitter tensions are also likely to cause a stir in Nato, of which Turkey is a member, and Erdogan has hinted he may seek new allies as a result of the sanctions.The lira made a modest recovery on Monday after the central bank pledged to provide funds and cut reserve requirements for Turkish banks.Many emerging economics such as Argeninta and South Africa could suffer from the crisis, given their exposure to Turkish debt."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dtGkg6VU.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pressure mounts on tory peer who attended tunisia conference with corbyn as mps demand hes expelled from the party","story":"In a joint letter Robert Halfon and Zac Goldsmith said the Tories would be guilty of “double standards” if they fail to throw him out -

Around 46 per cent of 25 to 34 year-olds now live in private rentals as house prices rocket.Some 80 per cent of the tenancies in England and Wales are set at six or 12 months.Charities warned this leaves tenants at the risk of eviction at short notice- and demanded a change.Shelter chief Polly Neate last night said the Government’s decision was “very good news” that would transform the lives of many struggling to make ends meet.She said: “The current renting system is a complete mess, with families teetering on the edge of blink-and-you-miss-it six-month contracts – barely enough time to set your broadband up, let alone see your kids through school.“This problem will not be fixed by giving landlords a tax break to coax them into doing what everyone should be doing anyway.”Shelter earlier this week said 55 per cent of private renters believe longer tenancies would improve their situation.And they claimed two-thirds of renters would think better of a political party that brought in longer contracts.GOT a story?

That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart. An important story.Good people have left Labour as a consequence. The Jewish community in the UK is in uproar.Frightened of the far Left’s support for vile Islamists and its loathing of Israel and its right to exist.Scared of the morons who now lead Labour and its retinue of lefties who have said the most appalling, racist, stuff about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn, a genuine halfwit, thinks it is all “fake news”.He rolls his eyes when asked about it and gives different answers every time he is questioned.And guess who agrees with him? Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this?

The 24-year-old was on a first date with web designer Jack Shepherd, whom she met online. He was trying to impress her with the champagne-fulled trip past the Houses of Parliament but drove at twice the speed limit, before the boat hit a log and tipped over. Shepherd, 30, went on the run instead of facing trial but was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in his absence and jailed for six years. His refusal to face justice has left Charli’s family grief-stricken, frustrated, and with endless unanswered questions about that night in December 2015. Here Charli’s older sisters Katie, 29, and Vicky, 31, from Dartford, Kent, write an open letter to Shepherd.   Dear Jack Shepherd,  We both want you to know the terrible impact losing Charli has had on our lives. Katie heard the news of her death after a morning teaching science to secondary school children. A colleague gave her the message: “Please call your mum – \u0026shysomething has happened to your sister.” She wondered if Vicky, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, had her baby prematurely. But as soon as Katie heard mum’s sobs and words: “It’s Charli”, she said: “What has he done?” Call it intuition or a premonition, but somehow Katie just knew something had gone terribly wrong the night before. It began during your date when Charli started sending WhatsApp messages telling of the food you ate at the restaurant, and champagne on the speedboat.  That evening, Katie’s second last message to Charli said: “Please let me know you have you survived this \u0026shyescapade?” Charli didn’t answer. That night Katie couldn’t sleep. First thing the next day, she texted her concern: “Charli, are you alive?” That message wasn’t delivered to Charli’s phone, found in her pocket when they pulled her body from the river. Vicky was having a check up at the maternity hospital when she took mum’s call. She had a panic attack. Vicky remembers nothing except the sound of her own wailing. Hearing our baby sister was dead was the worst moment of our lives, until we had to identify her body. We went to the mortuary together with our parents, all hoping it wasn’t our Charli. As soon as we walked into the room and saw her, Mum and Vicky collapsed. Such deep trauma was dangerous for Vicky at such a late stage in pregnancy.  Her due date was December 29. But because of the distress caused by losing Charli, Vicky suffered a series of mini strokes and was admitted to hospital on December 20. She was induced for her and her baby’s safety, and because Charli’s funeral was planned for January 5 2016, and Vicky was terrified she’d go into labour as we said our final goodbyes. Because of you, Charli never met her gorgeous youngest nephew Edward, who was born on Boxing Day. Now Edward is two, the same age as your child who is growing up fatherless. Coming back to serve your time, and seeing your child, is surely better than a lifetime on the run, constantly looking over your shoulder? We urge you directly: give us answers and give yourself up. To any of your friends reading this, please know the net is closing in so you’re just delaying the inevitable. Jack, you’re young so facing justice and serving your time still gives you a chance of having a life, career and family.  Your reckless and cavalier attitude robbed Charli of that chance. But you can never take our memories of our glamorous, bubbly little sister. We remember Charli’s lovely confidence which made her comfortable meeting Vicky’s in-laws for the first time wearing huge rollers in her hair. We can laugh remembering her fearsome competitiveness playing crazy golf. We are both eaten up with anger about the loss of Charli, we both have an empty feeling of grief which feels like it will never end and a sense of living in constant shock. Our pain is indescribable. We were brought up as three very close sisters often mistaken for triplets and are now only two. At family Christmases, weddings and anniversaries we lay a place for Charli at the table. Seeing it empty makes every happy occasion sad. We spend Charli’s birthday at her grave. Time isn’t healing. We hurt just as much as we did in those first few weeks after Charli’s death. Our bereavement left us unable to function. Yet you married a woman you’d got pregnant within a month of the tragedy. We are stuck in an emotional fog because when you fled the court case, you stole our chance of closure and left us with unanswered questions.  You might expect us to lash out with threats or name-calling. But our family has too much dignity and decency. We know you don’t have a shred of either – because if you had a tiny speck of a conscience you’d have turned up at the Old Bailey to finally answer questions about the night you killed our sister. Instead, showing complete lack of respect for us and the legal system, you ran away. Your barrister excused your absence as cowardice. It’s also extreme arrogance and despicable selfishness. We wanted to hear what really happened that night you took Charli out on the Thames in a speedboat bought on Gumtree to “pull women”, as you smirkingly told police. Now we might never know. Why did you pester Charli for a date, tracking her down on Facebook after she blocked you on a dating site? When you knew of the dangerous debris in the Thames, why did you drive the boat at more than twice the speed limit in the dark?  Why take such risks while so drunk you didn’t know Charli’s name, or your own next of kin, when you were in the ambulance? We believe Charli would have survived if she had worn a life jacket. Why on earth didn’t you offer her one when you had two on board? So many questions. But our main one is: do you have any remorse? In the oppressively dark grief we searched for something good to come from Charli’s death. That has to be our petition to clarify and tighten laws covering dangerous driving and drinking while in control of a private boat. We won’t stop until we have at least 10,000 signatures so the Government will consider amending the very loose laws. Hopefully new rules will save lives and will one day be known as ‘Charli’s Law’.

The club\u0027s chief executive has told fans their away game at Albion was blemished for the second away game running after a small number were singing in support of the jailed far-right activist. The club brought 1,175 supporters to the Black Country for their Carabao Cup first round match against West Bromwich Albion on Tuesday. Luton’s fans were heard singing light-hearted songs including “Where’s your boiler gone?” referring to the absent mascot from Albion’s sponsors Ideal Boilers, and “Stacey’s too good for you”, joking about the opposition\u0027s recent interest in their full-back Jack Stacey. Luton CEO Gary Sweet said: “Apart from the result, our experience was blemished, for the second away game running, by hearing the chanting the name of a political figurehead by a small number of Hatters supporters,” said Sweet. “This is hugely disappointing for us, as a board, because the individual in question wasn’t playing or involved in the squad or staff.  Sweet said the club had worked and would continue to work extremely hard to create an environment for supporters to enjoy a football match without political, religious, cultural or racial prejudice. “This allows us to invite anybody into our environment without discomfort, disrespect or fear, and welcome any and every member of our wide community respectfully, he said. “Luton and Luton Town Football Club is intertwined in a rich tapestry of continuous change and diversity and, for me, the success of embracing such difference has always been ideologically characteristic of ‘being Lutonian’. “We absolutely accept and respect the fact that everyone holds their own independent opinions and values, but we politely ask for you to temporarily overlook those views for a couple of hours or so when attending Luton Town matches in future. “Please respect others when supporting our great club, please support the players on the pitch and please refrain from introducing non-football songs into our stadia.” "},{"url":null,"title":"heres pedestrianising parliament square really","story":"NewsopinionHere\u0027s why pedestrianising Parliament Square is a really terrible ideaIt\u0027ll only send the terrorists to TescoShare\u0026nbspByFleet Street FoxColumnist13:44, 15 AUG 2018Updated14:12, 15 AUG 2018NewsopinionGet politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailApart from the individual horror of being mown down by a speeding vehicle, yesterday\u0027s terror attack on Parliament was mostly harmless. No-one died. The terrorist was caught alive. There is no martyr, and if the worst they can do is smack their heads against a reinforced anti-terrorist barrier next to the most heavily-guarded building in Britain then, frankly, there\u0027s not a lot to lose sleep over.  Except there is, because as with every terror attack the hardest questions that must be asked are not, while official knees jerk to protect themselves.  Attacks on Parliament bring home to MPs that they are targets for those who take exception to their views, their politics or their existence. It\u0027s natural that after the second car-based attempt at mass murder on their place of work in 17 months, they would start to think that cars might be the problem. Only we don\u0027t say men are the problem, even though every single terror attack carried out on our shores of late has been conducted by people with testicles. The Islamists who have attacked us may have been Muslims, people of colour, slightly-thick zealots, and one-time petty criminals, but we have not and will not outlaw all such people for the crimes of a few. Boris Johnson would be stuffed, for a start. Yet some say it\u0027s time to pedestrianise Parliament Square. Because terrorists are never on foot, are they?   Terrorists have never been in cars, then got out of them to kill someone, have they?    Terrorists have never targeted places where all their potential victims are walking or sitting down, have they?   Terrorists are always the driver, aren\u0027t they?  Terror attacks often lead to changes, many of them useful. When the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton it led to stringent security measures for party political conferences. After 6 were killed and 50 injured at the Westminster Bridge terror attack, Theresa May promised another \u0026pound50m for counter-terrorism, having earlier been criticised for cuts.  And let\u0027s not be too architecturally-conservative about Parliament Square. It was laid out only in 1868, around the same time as the Victorians rebuilt the Houses of Parliament. It is a space owned by the Greater London Authority, which has the power to make bylaws for it, and has used this power in recent years to repeatedly curb the right to protest.  While there is a right to assembly on any public highway, on the roads around Parliament you must ask for police permission. So, on the face of it, pedestrianising the area - putting even the roads under local authority control, banning cars which happens anyway for approved protests, and keeping weapons-on-wheels away from the seat of our democracy - may seem like a sound idea. But it isn\u0027t.  Manchester Arena is not a public space, is privately-owned, and keeps its concert-goers away from vehicles. Salman Abedi still managed to blow himself and 22 others to pieces, killing and injuring huge numbers of children.   Abedi used a backpack and a suitcase. Parliament Square attracts millions of tourists a year, most of them with backpacks and suitcases.  Perhaps police and politicians would like bollards at the entrance to the square to include x-ray scanners, to catch those carrying bombs or knives in their backpacks?  In which case, we can look forward to everyone with a penknife or nail scissors being stopped, liquids being bagged and belts and shoes removed at the entrance to the square, just as they already are when you attempt to enter Parliament itself. And anyone who wishes to stage a protest or go to the TV studios at Millbank to criticise the government, will not only have to seek formal approval but be questioned as to their purpose on the way in and the way out. At this uncomfortably-authoritarian juncture, it might be wise to remind ourselves of the few times in recent history that Parliamentarians have actually been attacked.  Jo Cox MP was shot and stabbed on the roadside in Birstall, West Yorkshire in 2016 while on her way to meet constituents.  Stephen Timms MP was stabbed twice at a constituency surgery in a library in Beckton, east London in 2010.  More recently, Conservative life peer David Prior was the victim of a pig blood-based graffiti attack in his own home by an angry ex-girlfriend. When a brick was thrown through Angela Eagle\u0027s office, Stella Creasy was threatened with rape and Jess Phillips given death threats, it happened either in their own constituencies or online. And who could forget when deputy Labour leader John Prescott was egged outside a theatre in Rhyl, north Wales, in 2001 when on his way to a political rally.  As yet, no Islamist has yet come within 10 yards of a Parliamentarian at Parliament. Those who have launched attacks outside have not got in, and it has become quite apparent that while cars are good at killing pedestrians, they are rubbish at getting past armed police officers, metal barriers and brick walls.  Of course a Parliamentarian could be outside on his bike, as others were yesterday, or walking over Westminster Bridge, or coming through the gate at the wrong time. So could any one of a thousand other humans, and it is not for the public\u0027s sake anyone has suggested banning vehicles.  It has been suggested purely to look like something is being done - even though that thing would not deter a single terrorist. We have yet to hear of an incident averted because a devoted Islamist saw a \u0027keep off the grass\u0027 sign. They are not known for being law-abiding, and it should be noted that this latest attack involved an illegal turn on the wrong side of the road, in clear contravention of the Highway Code.  You can say this for cars being used as weapons - they tend to at least keep the driver alive. And if you ask any counter-terrorism officer what he\u0027d like most after a terror attack, he\u0027d say someone to interrogate.  He might further point out that, in his ideal world, the terrorists come to him. They choose the most-guarded, secure and bristling-with-police-officers building in the country, and run at it one at a time, almost as though they were idiots.  Parliament is a place that can handle terror. Blocking it off to cars does not stop terrorists - it just moves them down the road, to Tesco or the Tower of London or Top Shop. And there isn\u0027t a person on the planet who can\u0027t see that an attack on soft targets is not only easier for even the most stupid of zealots to manage, but it\u0027ll kill an awful lot more people.   Pedestrianisation is the go-to solution for every politician from the local town hall to Downing Street. Banning cars is the only way they can think of to boost local cafes, cut pollution and, now, protect democracy. Never mind that business rates, car manufacturers and sanity might all have more to do with it.  The ability to drive, in cars, taxis or buses, and to walk or cycle unhindered, through Parliament Square does two important things. First, it means millions of us get to see the place close up. On visits, school trips, holidays, the daily commute and in tiny glimpses on our way to somewhere else, we are reminded it is there, and that it is ours. If it were pedestrianised it would be seen only by those who seek it out. And secondly, it tells the terrorists - these dense meat-sacks who could not in any other situation terrify a wet kitten - that we are unmoved. Our democracy has survived worse, and it will survive them.

Lord Sheikh has faced a barrage of complaints from fellow Tories for attending the 2014 conference.  Conservative MPs Robert Halfon and Zac Goldsmith have complained to party HQ, claiming that attending the 2014 conference was in itself a breach of the party\u0027s code of conduct and does nothing to combat the scourge of anti-Semitism. Quite the reverse.  Lord Sheikh was vocal last week in his criticism of Boris Johnson\u0027s comments comparing burqa-wearers to bank robbers and letterboxes.  And Mr Goldsmith has repeatedly refused to apologise over his 2016 run for Mayor of London, where he was accused of using dog whistle tactics to paint Sadiq Khan as extreme.   Lord Sheikh said the trip, paid for by the Tunisian Government, was properly declared, and he only attended part of it. He said: I was invited by the President of Tunisia to visit Tunis on 29 September – 2 October 2014. My trip was declared under the Parliamentary rules. I did state that the Government of Tunisia did pay for my flights and accommodation. The meeting was held in the context of the Arab Spring which affected the whole of the Middle East and North Africa. I arrived in the early hours and attended the conference which started at about 9:30 am. I only attended the morning session as I left the conference to rest as I was very tired. And he insisted he was not aware of the ceremony attended by Mr Corbyn where wreaths were laid next to memorials to several alleged members of Black September, who were behind the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre.  He said: At the conference, I saw Jeremy Corbyn. I was not aware and did not know that Jeremy Corbyn was going to be there. I did not meet with any members of Hamas. I did not know anything about the wreath laying ceremony. I was not told about this and did not attend the ceremony… Corbyn yesterday said the tribute he personally paid was in memory of a 1985 Israeli air raid on the PLO offices in the city - regardless of where in the cemetery the wreath was placed. Lord Sheikh added: I have a very good connection with the Jewish Peers and in fact I worked with Lord Palmer when the practice of Shechita and Halal meat was raised. We saw the relevant minister together and I spoke on this subject in the House of Lords. I have also looked at issues with the Jewish community relating to post-mortems and circumcision. At school, my best friend was a Jewish boy and I have connections with Jewish families.

Always on time, well organised and, based on all the conversations the Ku Klux Klan’s members had with him, a powerful advocate for their hateful racist politics. What they didn’t know was that Ron was a black police officer. In 1979, Officer Stallworth, then 29, spent a year infiltrating the KKK and exposing their links with the police, military and organised crime. His audacious scheme, which started when he saw an advert in his local paper asking for potential KKK members, has inspired what some critics have called “the most important film of the year”, BlacKkKlansman. But in many ways, the truth is even stranger than Spike Lee’s movie makes it out to be. Working as an intelligence officer for the Colorado Springs Police Department, Ron was the only black officer on the force. So he took the rising tide of racist violence very seriously. And when he answered that advert, picking up the phone to talk to local KKK organiser Ken O’Dell, Ron knew he was risking more than embarrassment if they found out who he was.  America was gripped by far-right terrorism in the 1970s. In 1971, KKK members used dynamite to blow up ten buses which were to be used to desegregate schools in Pontiac, Michigan. In the months when Ron was planning his scheme, five communist protestors demonstrating in a Death To The Klan march were killed by the KKK and the American Nazi Party in the Greensboro massacre in North Carolina. In 1980, four black women were shot in Chattanooga, Tennessee, after a KKK rally. Just six months, later Michael Donald, age 20, was lynched in Alabama, his body found hanging from a tree. With this kind of bigoted violence going on, it’s fair to say that Ron knew the kind of character he was supposed to be playing when trying to ingratiate himself with the KKK’s O’Dell. Ron said: “I eventually spoke with him over the phone responding to that ad, and he explained to me that he was starting a Klan chapter in Colorado Springs and was looking for new people. “So I told him that I was a white man, that I hated blacks, Jews, Mexicans, Asians. That I thought the white man had not gotten a fair deal in this country. “[That] I was really upset because my sister had dated a n***** and it offended me that his black hands had touched her white body. And, as a result, I wanted to join the group and do what I could to put a stop to all of this nonsense.”  That was all it took – Ron, who now lives in El Paso, Texas, with his wife, was in. But very quickly he knew he was going to get caught if he couldn’t solve a major problem. How could he, a black man, walk into the public meetings of a large and violent racist organisation dedicated to seeing him back in chains? He was fine dealing with them over the phone, but he knew that when it came to having face-to-face meet-ups, he couldn’t go himself. So he drafted in his friend, Chuck, who worked in the drug squad, to be Ron Stallworth in person. It was also at this point that Ron realised he had – perhaps shortsightedly – signed his own name on his first letter to the KKK. However, it wasn’t just the practical problems holding up Ron’s investigation. Senior officers took a while to be convinced of its merits. “They felt like they couldn’t lose investigators to a bunch of nonsense like ‘men running around in sheets’,” said Ron. But with no signs of America’s racial violence subsiding, senior officers eventually agreed. Ron arranged to meet O’Dell, who was a serving soldier, at a bar near Fort Carson military base. He sent Chuck in wearing a wire, and guided him through the tricky conversations. “That’s how we conducted this investigation over the next eight or nine months or so,” Ron said. “I did most of the talking on the phone with these individuals, and when it came time for physical contact, the face-to-face meeting, I would send the white officer in posing as me.”  After months of phone calls and secret meetings, the infiltration was going so well that, incredibly, O’Dell recommended that Ron be made the head of the Colorado Springs branch of the KKK. He was put in touch with the hate group’s leader, David Duke. At one point – clearly confident that his plan hadn’t been rumbled – he even asked the KKK’s leader about the threat of infiltration. Ron explained: “I said, aren’t you afraid of an undercover police officer infiltrating your organisation or maybe a black man calling you up and pretending to be white?” “He said no, he wasn’t fearful of that at all, because he could always tell when he was talking to a black person.” Pushing his luck, Ron asked how Duke knew that he wasn’t black. “He said, you don’t talk like a black man. You talk like a very smart, intellectual white man. I can tell by the way you pronounce certain words.” Then, in an incident that seems more like far-fetched movie plot than real life, Ron – in his role as a serving police officer, rather than an undercover agent – met Duke in person. He was tasked with protecting the so-called Grand Wizard while he delivered a racist rant in public. He said: “I went and introduced myself to David Duke without giving him a name and told him I would do everything I could to protect him, even though I didn’t agree with him. We shook hands and I became his bodyguard.” Ron’s investigation in many ways highlighted his worst-possible fears. He found Klansmen in all walks of life, from local shop owners to school teachers and his neighbours.

Nicholas Keith Warner, who arrived in Ireland last week, appeared at Limavady Magistrate’s Court charged with attempting to murder three men, two of them aged in their 30s and one aged in his 60s.  The three men each sustained stabbing injuries in an incident outside a bar at Main Street in the Co Antrim village of Ballycarry last Saturday night.  Warner, an electrical engineer from Morrow Lane in Summerville, South Carolina, denies attempting to murder the three men and he also denies assaulting a fourth man. The defendant further denies causing an affray but he admits possessing a knife.  The defendant, who sustained a broken leg in the incident, was helped by two police officers as he walked on crutches from a cell van on Main Street, Limavady, into the courthouse for his remand appearance. His wife Kaylee, a nurse also from South Carolina, sat behind her husband as he sat in the dock during the hearing. When asked by the court clerk if he understood the charges, the defendant replied “yes mam”. A detective constable told Deputy District Judge Ted Magill that he believed he could connect the defendant to the charges and he said alcohol was an issue in the case. Defence solicitor David Jones told the court that bail conditions proposed by the police and by the Public Prosecution Service were acceptable to the defendant.  “He accepts he was the individual who caused the injuries. From the moment of his arrest prior to his interviews he accepted he possessed the knife to defend himself”, Mr Jones said. “This case will come down to the argument of reasonable force or otherwise and because he is a US citizen I would request that if possible the case could be fast tracked. It is regrettable in that he is here on his honeymoon and his employment as an electrical engineer is now is jeopardy”, Mr Jones added. The defendant was released on his own bail of \u0026pound1,000 to appear at Ballymena Magistrate’s Court on September 6.

The ranking system aims to give parents a better idea of which schools will help their child prosper, no matter what their background may be. The guide shows interesting trends with 80 per cent of the top 20 schools in England based in London and the South East.  What do you think of your school\u0027s performance? Email webnews@mirror   Four our of the top five schools in England are based in London. Just four of the schools are from the north and midlands with two form Lancashire, and one each from Liverpool and Reading. As well as this, girls-only secondaries make up half of the top performing schools in England\u0027s top 20.    In Wales\u0027 top 20, a quarter of the top schools are based in Cardiff while 25 per cent of the worst secondaries are in Flintshire. The top two worst performing schools in Wales, Glyn Derw High School and Michaelston Community College, both in Cardiff, were closed last summer to make way for the new Cardiff West Community High School. Other factors are also included in the data such as whether all pupils are making progress, attendance rates, the ratio of teachers to pupils, school finances, and whether students go on to further education or jobs. Attainment is worth 30 per cent of the total score. This is based on pupils’ Attainment 8, EBacc and GCSE performance in 2017.   Whether a school is getting top marks and if its GCSE results are improving year-on-year is also measured. Progress is worth 40 per cent of the score and is based on how well all as well as different types of pupil do in comparison to expectations and how well the school does at closing the gender gap. It also looks at how big the pupil/teacher ratio is in comparison to the national average, as well as teachers’ average salaries. The attendance score is based on absence rates, looking at both overall levels of sessions missed as well as unauthorised and persistent absence at the school. It is worth 15 per cent of the total score. Outcomes is also worth 15 per cent, and is based on what proportion of pupils continue with education, employment or training after Year 11, and what proportion leave employment, education or training within three months - in comparison to the national average.  Schools that had no Year 11 pupils taking Attainment 8 qualifying subjects in 2017 are not rated.  Speaking about Wembley High Technology College topping the list, Cllr Amer Agha, Brent Council’s Cabinet Member for Schools, Employment and Skills, said:     “Our aim is to ensure that every child in Brent has the best start in life possible, and so having one of our schools recognised as the best in the country, is hugely satisfying and testament to the hard work that’s been put in by everyone at the school.        “Coming a month after the council’s best-ever Ofsted rating and a few months after a Brent teacher won the Global Teacher Prize, this is another great day for Brent’s young people and I offer my sincere thanks and congratulations to all those involved.” The unique rating system uses 50 different measures, put together from the latest publicly-available data and broken into four categories - attainment, progress, attendance, and outcomes. National league tables may only look at overall GCSE results, as well as newer measures. Attainment This is worth 30 per cent of the total score. It is based on pupils\u0027 average grade attainment score, including what the average scores for different groups of pupils were, as well as the proportions gaining the English Baccalaureate and those getting A* to C grades in GCSE subjects. It measures whether a school is getting top marks, and if it is managing to improve year-on-year. Progress This is worth 40 per cent of the score. It is based on how well different types of pupil do in terms of progressing. It also looks at things that may contribute to teaching outcomes, such as how big the pupil/teacher ratio is in comparison to the national average, as well as teachers\u0027 average salaries. Attendance This score is based on absence rates, looking at both overall levels of sessions missed as well as unauthorised and persistent absence at the school. It is worth 15 per cent of the total score. Outcomes This is also worth 15 per cent, and is based on what proportion of pupils continue with education after Year 11 or go on to training and work."},{"url":null,"title":"boy 5 completely traumatised after","story":"NewsBoy, 5, \"completely traumatised\" after being repeatedly bitten by teenage girl in McDonald\u0027sCharlie Vyse was pinned down in the middle of the fast food restaurant, while the stranger, believed to be 13-years-old, slapped and kicked himShare\u0026nbspByYasmin HarishaKelly-Ann Mills17:24, 15 AUG 2018Updated23:11, 15 AUG 2018News (Image: SWNS- Cambridge)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA five-year-old boy has been left completely traumatised after being repeatedly bitten by a teenage girl in McDonald\u0027s. Charlie Vyse was pinned down in the middle of the fast food restaurant, while the stranger, believed to be 13-years-old, slapped and kicked him. The little boy suffered wounds to his legs, hands and arms as a result of the bloodied assault, which his mum Jessica believes could have killed a child. Jessica, 25, said: I was terrified. Hearing your child cry, because he was screaming... it was probably one of the worst things that I’ve ever been through. As a mum, it’s just so horrific. I can’t even imagine how much that hurt because her whole weight was on him pinning him down while she was biting him. It was horrific.  Jessica, Charlie and his little sister Elsie, two, were on their way back from a family day out when they stopped at the McDonald’s in Hampton near Peteborough, Cambs. He had been holding his mother\u0027s hand but she turned round after feeling his hand slip out of hers to see the girl on top of him. A woman, believed to be the girl\u0027s mum, was telling her to stop and allegedly said ‘I’m sorry, she’s autistic,’ according to the mother. Jessica said the girl was “hitting, scratching, biting. Down his back, his bottom, his legs.”  She said: I leaned down and I was saying ‘oh no, jump up’. As I got down to lift him up, I realised the girl was shaking her head and her teeth were in his back. He was obviously hysterical. “Charlie was still crying. I managed to pull him away slightly but it was at least 30 seconds, and she was biting him all the way down his body as I dragged him. “She was biting, hitting, scratching him. Then I fell back myself and had Charlie on top of me because I gave one last tug.”  The mum, who is a student children\u0027s nurse, pulled her children away to the disabled toilets where she found blood running down a tearful Charlie’s back. They then left McDonald’s, despite the girl allegedly trying to attack Charlie again, who was left “completely traumatised”. Jessica claims the police initially failed to investigate the incident which happened in July but have since made inquiries.  Jessica says Charlie is now receiving support and counselling due to the trauma caused. She said: Charlie is getting the support he needs and counselling from the relevant people, so hopefully we can move forward from this. I just think the whole thing has touched upon a subject that is clearly delicate but that needs addressing. Jessica shared a post about the experience on social media, which has since been shared more than 7,000 times.

Freda Jackson, 81, said she cried at the end of her two-week trip and that the hotel she stayed in was full of Spanish holidaymakers. The grandmother, from Blackburn, Lancashire, went on to complain that the Spanish guests at the Poseidon Playa hotel were rude and that the evening entertainment was all focused and catered for the Spanish. Now, locals have hit back at the pensioner, saying she needs to scrub up on her geography skills next time she plans to take a trip abroad.  After the story appeared on Spanish news site Marca , one reader said: We should remind the good lady that Benidorm is in Spain.  Another said: If she hates Spain so much...why is she coming. It seems it would be good to learn some geography.  Freda had booked her Benidorm holiday in April 2017 after claiming travel operator Thomas Cook had recommended the hotel. But despite her request for ground access flat, Freda and her 61-year-old friend were placed on a slope instead. Grandmother-of-six Freda and her friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Freda said: I have never complained about a holiday before - but this one was a disaster from start to finish. She added: My friend and I paid for it from our pensions and it was a struggle trying to fund it over 12 months and the holiday was totally ruined - I cried after. The hotel was full of Spanish holidaymakers and they really got on our nerves because they were just so rude.  One evening a Spanish guy nearly knocked me flying and he just walked off without even apologising. The entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish - why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays? Freda claims her requests for specific flats in the hotel were ignored and the operator failed to inform them of a change to the flights. She added: We wanted to go somewhere on flat ground and not in the hills because we have mobility issues. To top it off once we got to reception they told us we had been put on the 14th floor, thankfully we were moved to the second floor, and that it was 42 steps down to the hotel\u0027s swimming pool. The pair travelled 1,500 miles from Manchester Airport to Alicante on May 10, after not being notified by Thomas Cook that the dates of their flights had changed. Freda, who has previously visited Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Tenerife, claims Thomas Cook \u0027mis-sold\u0027 and \u0027ruined\u0027 her dream holiday.

Scaffolder Jamie Mines, 34, was thrown 13ft from a half-finished metal roof when 33,000 volts of electricity surged through a tin sheet he was holding.  The talented footballer spent ten weeks in intensive care supported by then-girlfriend Harley Ware and their twin daughters Savannah and Isabella. But Jamie has revealed he has now amicably split from 26-year-old Harley and is living alone and regularly looks after the kids. Despite his injuries the loving dad is thriving with his four prosthetic limbs, cleaning his home and cooking for himself and his daughters when they visit.  Jamie of Frome, Somerset, has claw hands on the ends of his prosthetic arms and says he lives for his visits from Savannah and Isabella. He can even clamber up on to the low trampoline in his back garden to bounce with them. Jamie has also learnt to drive thanks to a specially-adapted steering wheel fitted with a tetragrip lever, which accelerates when flicked up and reverses when flicked down. He is using the gym everyday, is eyeing a return to football, and is aiming to be a Paralympic runner. Jamie has been living on his own since February this year, after parting amicably from Harley.  She remained by his bedside while he was placed in an induced coma for three weeks at Southmead Hospital, Bristol following the incident in December 2016. Jamie said: We parted on good terms. I just didn\u0027t want to be a burden - she had to deal with a lot, looking after me. Now, Jamie sees adorable Savannah and Isabella once a week for a day and overnight, and has thrown himself into fatherhood. He said: I\u0027m getting fitter each day. I take the girls to the park when they\u0027re here, or we\u0027ll go to Longleat safari park. They like being outdoors, which can be hard for me, because I get tired very quickly. But I\u0027ve started going to the gym for an hour every morning, trying to get my energy levels back up to how they were before the accident.  Jamie has care staff visit twice a day, at 12pm and 6pm, to help him around the house - but he says he is able to do most things for himself. He said: I can cook for myself if it\u0027s something that just needs to go on a baking tray in the oven, and I can boil veg and so on. I can pretty much do most things for myself - I can hoover the house, but the one thing I struggle with is dusting. He added: I have dressed the girls before, but it takes me about an hour to do. So the carer helps me get them dressed and undressed, and helps with bathtimes and nappy changes and things like that. But, just like any other dad of toddlers, Jamie has no problems scooping Savannah and Isabella up in his arms, or putting them in their high-chairs and preparing an afternoon snack. And outside of caring for his girls once a week, Jamie id determined to get back into sport - and is working towards his ultimate goal of becoming a Paralympic runner.  He is awaiting the arrival of special running blade prosthetic legs to allow him to get back into one of his former favourite pasttimes. Jamie, who had his final limb, his left leg, removed on July 4 last year, said: I was up and about almost as soon as I had my second prosthetic leg fitted on August 20. I took to it straight away. I was a bit wobbly at first, but it only took me an hour so to get used to it. The mind is your only barrier. A lot of people who need amputations in adulthood are quite scared of adapting to losing a limb. But I wasn\u0027t scared or anything. The determined former football striker now spends an hour each morning at the gym - and says he can use almost all the equipment, except the machine weights. I do 20 minutes cycling, and I also work out my shoulders, chest and back, said Jamie.

The massive stack of hay has been piled up on trailers in a field adjacent to the back gardens of several \u0026pound500,000 detached properties. Villagers believe they were put there deliberately after a planning application by farmer Richard Barton to run a waste processing site was rejected. But Mr Barton has defended the move, accusing neighbours of making a straw mountain out of a molehill. Among those affected was resident Peter Shaw, 55, who said the bales were stacked behind his house on Cole Road, Ockbrook, Derbyshire, last Thursday.  Mr Shaw and his wife Helen, 50, moved into the home in 2004, and say this is the first time they have encountered an issue with Mr Barton. Mr Shaw, who works in the motoring trade, says the bales are a potential fire risk and is urging Mr Barton, 44, to remove them. He said: The farmer won\u0027t speak to you, I have tried. He\u0027s just a bully. I truly believe it is just something we are going to have to live with now. I have contacted everyone and anyone that I possibly can and nothing seems to getting done about it.  It feels as though there is one rule for one person and another rule for others. It\u0027s an eye sore - I\u0027m not sure they are even stored correctly. He\u0027s put 30 tons on a trailer. First, the lorries came and they were full of hay bales and he put them in place one by one. So we\u0027ve got three in a row. More and more bales were put on top - there might be a row of seven or eight - I\u0027m not entirely sure now. You can see it from the road, you can see it from the footbridge.  It\u0027s about ten meters from my home - if they were to fall then they would destroy my garden. I thought they were a fire risk but the fire brigade said to me they\u0027re not a fire risk. The farmer has been trying to put a planning application through now for the past eight years. He wants to create a site to process waste. The application has been rejected not just by ourselves but by the whole village. It just seems because my house backs onto his farm - that we have to bear the brunt of this. Another resident on the street said: The view from our back garden used to be open fields but now all you can see is a wall of hay.  I\u0027m convinced this is some kind of protest against the village because the farmer didn\u0027t get the planning permission he wanted. It\u0027s a form of intimidation and is just simply being done out of spite. Speaking from his farm in Ockbrook, Derbys., where he lives with wife Samantha, 50, he said: It\u0027s got nothing to do with the planning application for a waste processing site. Where am I supposed to put my bales? They [the residents] are selfish - all they think about is themselves. All they want to see is green land but I don\u0027t even get that view and its my farm. I\u0027ve got my property here, I can\u0027t put them [hay bales] on my drive because there\u0027s no space - I\u0027ve got sheds in the way too. There\u0027s a dual carriageway on the other side I can\u0027t put them there. He added: They\u0027re making a straw mountain out of a molehill. I put them in the middle of the field and they complained about that and the council told me to move them. Now I\u0027ve moved them they\u0027re complaining again. All they\u0027ve done for the past few years is try and portray me as some horrible neighbour and horrible person. It\u0027s not their fields - I live literally next to the bales too. The fire brigade have come out and said it\u0027s not a fire risk. I don\u0027t know why they called me a bully - I\u0027m not a bully. I\u0027ve lived here my whole life - my mum and dad have lived here too - we\u0027ve always farmed. I\u0027ve never not farmed and they\u0027re telling the council I don\u0027t farm.

Terminally-ill Fiona Strong suffered a barbaric death as she repeatedly came out of a drug-induced sleep from which she had never expected to awake. Confused and scared, the 31-year-old spent her last days in agonising pain - with her heartbroken loved ones forced to say goodbye again and again. She had wanted to die with dignity - a wish she didn\u0027t get. But now, her close pals Sally Johnstone and Abbie Haggan are making sure another of her wishes is fulfilled - to help homeless and disadvantaged people. The grieving friends will be cycling nearly 1,000 miles from Land\u0027s End, Cornwall, to John O\u0027Groats, Scotland, to raise money for a fund in Fiona\u0027s name. They start their challenge this weekend - and they can\u0027t wait.   We’re really looking forward to it and hope we achieve something that would have made Fi very proud, Sally and Abbie told . We have known Fi since we were 11. Everyone brings their own individual element to a friendship and Fiona\u0027s was energy, humour and charm to what some would say is our slightly more prudish and reserved selves. We used to talk about how lucky we were as a group that nothing bad had ever happened to us – we are privileged, especially with having wonderfully loving family and friends. When Fi got sick she would often reflect on this. It felt like our amazing good fortune might have run out. The pair had last seen Fiona at The Margaret Centre at Whipps Cross Hospital, east London, on Thursday, April 26, just days before she took her final breaths. They had initially planned to start their bike ride that Sunday, but when their friend\u0027s condition deteriorated, they secretly postponed it to be close to her. They decided not to tell her, knowing she would be upset with the postponement because of the amount of time and planning they had put into the challenge. Abbie and Sally will start their LEJOG challenge on Sunday. Fiona\u0027s mum Susan said: They have been and continue to be wonderful to Fiona. It would have been so easy to just cancel the challenge after Fiona died but they are determined to carry on. They have certainly gone above and beyond the realms of friendship for Fiona. Here is the pair\u0027s itinerary for their bike ride: August 19 - Land\u0027s End to Camelford August 20 - Camelford to Tiverton August 21 - Tiverton - Clevedon August 22 - Clevedon - Tewkesbury August 23 - Tewkesbury - Stafford August 24 - Stafford - Hindley August 25 - Hindley - Kendal August 26 - Kendal - Lockerbie August 27 - Lockerbie to Newbridge (Edinburgh) August 28 - Newbridge to Pitlochry August 29 - Pitlochry - Craggie August 30 - Craggie - Golspie August 31 - Golspie to Inverness To donate to Abbie and Sally\u0027s cause, click here. Every time a nurse walked into the room, she [Fiona] said, \u0027This is Sally and Abbie who are cycling 1000 miles!\u0027,  the friends recalled. There was no way we could tell her we might not be leaving for the ride, especially if she thought it had anything to do with her, so we decided to give her a cuddle before we set off and give her a chance to wish us luck. They added: We both held her hands - Fi liked to hold your hand - and chatted about the ridiculous challenge ahead. We gave her a kiss and said \u0027love you\u0027 - which we always say now as friends - and left her be. The following day, Abbie and Sally received the heartwrenching news that Fiona wouldn\u0027t be able to take part in an immunotherapy trial she had hoped for. They were told she would soon die, with her cancer quickly growing. We took the decision not to go and see Fiona again as she was very content in the knowledge that we had set off on the cycle and we wanted it to stay that way, said the friends, who were taking unpaid leave from work for the ride. She would have been furious if she thought we’d postponed because of her.  They added: She asked her friend Mel who was at the hospice throughout to send us a message from Fi’s phone on the Saturday, which read ‘Hey gang. Wishing you an awesome start on this exciting adventure. \u0027I’m behind you every pedal of the way. Love loads xxxx’. We believe she is. Fiona, who first met Abbie and Sally at secondary school, had been diagnosed with the rare and aggressive childhood cancer rhabdomyosarcoma in 2015. As the disease progressed, it snatched away her ability to move, eat or drink. But the stoic young woman was determined to not be a vegetable, telling her mum Susan Strong earlier this year: I really want to die with dignity. In her last days, she courageously opted for medication to relieve her overwhelming pain that she knew, as a side effect, would result in sedation. She then shared a final, emotional goodbye with Susan in her hospice room. But as we reported in June, instead \u0027sleeping\u0027 peacefully until she passed away, as hoped, Fiona woke up in terrible pain just 20 minutes later.  And for the next four days, she continued to wake. Terrified, she would scream out in pain as her loved ones and doting nurses tried to comfort her. Each time, Susan would say another \u0027last goodbye\u0027 to her daughter, who had told medics she did not want to be fed or watered while receiving end-of-life care. But it was only after seven farewells that Fiona eventually died on May 1. Her mum has since been campaigning for assisted dying - and has insisted she would have helped her daughter to end her own life, if possible. We must have said our goodbyes six or seven times until she finally passed away, said Susan, who described Fiona\u0027s treatment as \u0027terminal sedation\u0027. She underwent five days of continual waking and pain. Every time she fell asleep, we thought that would be it. It would be very upsetting - then she\u0027d wake up again. At one point, she woke up and was thirsty. I gave her a drink and she said. \u0027Mum, stop trying to keep me alive.\u0027 It was scary for her as well. It\u0027s not what she wanted. It was torturous. Fiona\u0027s mum Susan said her daughter loved animals, scuba diving and conservation. She also used to work with children with disabilities, which she adored.  The Fiona Strong Memorial Fund has been set up in her name.  With this foundation she will be able to help an eclectic group of people, individuals and organisations who champion the plight of the homeless for example, Susan said. The Foundation is being set up through the Community Foundation for Surrey. Fiona worked at the Safeguarding Children department at Surrey Council and she was very keen to also help children who were either abused or disadvantaged.  This charity receive requests for grants and distribute the funds to those in need with the authority of Fiona\u0027s brother, Iain who is overseeing the foundation. Speaking to  earlier this summer, she added: It was more difficult [for Fiona] because she was having to say goodbyes to everybody again and again and again. There was no peace of mind. Even the nurses and doctors at the hospice were in distress as there was nothing further they could do to ease her suffering. Continuous deep sedation, often labelled \u0027terminal sedation\u0027 or \u0027palliative sedation\u0027 by relatives, has been used for decades to relieve the suffering of the terminally ill. The hospice says while it increased Fiona\u0027s sedation to relieve her agitation as safely as it could, she did experience some consciousness in her final days. Although the young woman was not given food or liquid at this time, in accordance with her wishes, her mouth and lips were kept moist by hospice nurses. She was also given medication to relieve her unbearable pain. But despite medics\u0027 best efforts to care for her at the facility in Leytonstone, they could not stop her excruciating suffering - because of the law, her mum said.  [The doctors] didn\u0027t use the words \u0027terminal sedation\u0027 said Susan, who was joined at the hospice by Fiona\u0027s dad, Clive Strong, and devoted boyfriend, Alex Paxton. She claimed: They said to Fi, \u0027We could sedate you and you wouldn\u0027t wake up after about four hours and eventually just stay asleep.\u0027 The mum-of-two, 61, is fighting for compassionate euthanasia in a bid to prevent hundreds of others from going through the same ordeal Fiona did. If she was well enough I\u0027d have taken her to Dignitas in Switzerland, she said. She was screaming out all the time, even with all that pain relief. It was just awful. All she wanted to do was keep her dignity in tact and be pain-free. We would not allow an animal to suffer like this. She added: Fiona was so stoic and brave but how she died was so unnecessary. Abbie and Sally agreed, telling : We passionately support the call for compassionate euthanasia. What Fiona went through in her final days was barbaric and her family and friends will have to live with that forever.  Seeing our brave friend sobbing because she wasn’t able to stay still long enough for a scan because she was in agony but couldn’t have more pain relief will forever haunt us. They added: One of the main arguments against it is the belief that palliative care should be improved - we cannot speak more highly of the palliative care team that looked after Fiona. They were wonderful and did everything they could possibly do to make her more comfortable within the constraints of the law – their job is to make the unbearable a bit more bearable for everyone affected and they did that. They too were distressed at the point that they could not do any more. Assisted dying is illegal in the UK, but a Mirror poll in June found that three out of four Brits would support a law change to allow it. They want people with a terminal illness who have six months or less to live to be given the right to decide when they die.  Abbie and Sally continued: No family or friend should ever be in the position where they are having to choose between denying their terminally-ill loved one their wish to die, when nothing more can be done to help them, and breaking the law or forcing them to take their own life. The law has to change. Fiona was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma - a type of soft tissue sarcoma - in October 2015 after complaining of headaches, a numb face and nausea. But despite her worrying symptoms, it was only after her eye began protruding that a tumour was discovered in her paranasal sinuses. They told her it was a tumour and to prepare for cancer, Susan added. They had to do a biopsy to test whether it was the disease. After undergoing a biopsy at St George\u0027s Hospital in Tooting, south London, Fiona, then 28, returned to her Leytonstone home, where she was constantly sick. It was the tumour pressing on her brain causing her to be sick, her mum explained. We didn\u0027t sleep all night. As the sickness grew worse, Fiona ended up being admitted to hospital, where she was later told the news she and her family had feared.  The consultant came in and said, \u0027Unfortunately, it\u0027s a very rare type of cancer. It usually affects children but is very unusual in adults\u0027, Susan said. I was in bits, I was devastated. Fiona, who worked for a market research company, was told the tumour was in an awkward position, located in the bone and sinus behind her right eye. For the next 14 months, she underwent treatment at The Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, including gruelling rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She suffered facial paralysis and spent her 29th birthday in intensive care battling sepsis - but faced it all with humour, dignity and incredible courage. Fiona gave the disease the respect it deserved but she didnt let it define her. She didn\u0027t want to be the person who was talking about her illness, Susan said. Despite her own struggles, Fiona also went out of her way to help others, raising more than \u0026pound10,000 for cancer charities and donating her brunette hair to the Little Princess Trust. And in January 2017, she was given something she had dreamed of - the all-clear.  But tragically, after only four months of remission, her eye started playing up again and doctors told her that a new cancerous tumour had been found. Despite undergoing further chemotherapy, radiotherapy, a clinical trial and even surgery to remove her eye at Moorfields Eye Hospital, the disease spread. Before long, Fiona\u0027s tumour had invaded both her brain and her nose, making it difficult for her to breathe - with the cancer also in her neck, shoulder and spine. A nurse was coming to the house to give her pain relief, Susan said. They said, \u0027I think we should get her to a hospice\u0027. In constant pain, Fiona was admitted to The Margaret Centre on April 9, where she was joined by mostly elderly patients and a team of compassionate nurses. She was on so many drugs, but they still couldn\u0027t control the pain, Susan said. She said to me, \u0027I\u0027m going to give it till April 27. If I don\u0027t feel any better, I want you to help me end my life. Take me to Switzerland or something\u0027. Before her admission, Fiona\u0027s loved ones had begun raising more than \u0026pound100,000 for immunotherapy treatment which would have started later that month.  They raised a whopping \u0026pound43,000 of their target, and despite her rapidly deteriorating condition, the young woman vowed to give it one last shot. Fiona said, \u0027even if immunotherapy gives me a few weeks extra\u0027, Susan said. She had a network of friends who were absolutely incredible. But unfortunately, Fiona, who loved scuba diving, travelling and socialising with pals, never got the chance to undergo immunotherapy. To her and her family\u0027s horror, her cancer was growing too fast. She had lost all mobility in her legs, couldn\u0027t walk, could partially move her neck... the tumour was growing so much it had grown into her neck, her mum said. Her tongue was swollen so she was finding it difficult to speak and eat. In late April, doctors asked Fiona what she wanted to happen. She said, \u0027I really want to die with dignity\u0027, I don\u0027t want to be a vegetable where I can\u0027t speak. I can\u0027t move and I\u0027ve got no quality of life,\u0027 Susan said.  Fiona was told she could undergo end-of-life treatment to relieve her distress which, as a side effect, would cause her to fall into a \u0027deep sleep\u0027, according to her mum. She said that\u0027s what she wanted, she said. The young woman agreed to the treatment - involving syringe drivers and no food or water - which she hoped would leave her sedated until her eventual death. We all sat around her bed and said our goodbyes. We thought that that was going to be it. But it never happened... she kept waking up, Susan said. In some ways it was alarming because we were pleased she\u0027d woken up selfishlessly. It was like a rollercoaster. She claimed that even the doctors and nurses were left stunned. Fiona would say something poignant about us all, it was quite distressing, said Susan, who is divorced from her daughter\u0027s dad and now with partner Steve, 62. We\u0027d think \u0027well that\u0027s it\u0027. And then she\u0027d wake up. The nurses were in tears. In her final hours, Fiona\u0027s breathing became laboured and she started suffering from blood clots in her mouth, which caused her to gurgle.  The nurses had to use a suction pump to take them out, her mum said. She added: She then started making a noise as if she was calling me but couldn\u0027t speak. I got up and held her hand. She couldn\u0027t talk but she was aware I was there. The nurse said her breathing was getting shallower. Soon after, the young woman took her last breaths. She finally passed away on the Tuesday morning, said Susan, who moved down South from her home in Fife, Scotland, to care for Fiona. At the end of the day I didn\u0027t want to lose Fiona,but I didn\u0027t want her to be in pain. She definitely should\u0027ve been allowed to end her own life. It wasn\u0027t what we imagined at all. Addressing concerns about relaxing euthanasia rules, the mum said she believes patients should have to sign a detailed document about their treatment.  We shouldn\u0027t be a passive patient, said Susan, who is staying at a friend\u0027s house, as she sorts out Fiona\u0027s belongings and flat. You\u0027d have to be aware of what you were getting, it would need to be open. There could even be a medical card, like there has been with organ donation. She added:Fiona\u0027s quality of life had diminished drastically by the end. There does have to be a degree of dignity. We can keep people alive but it\u0027s wrong to keep them alive if they are suffering things so great. I wouldn\u0027t want my worst enemy to go through what Fiona went through. Critics have said relaxing assisted dying laws would put pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives out of fear of being a financial, emotional and care burden. However, campaign organisation Dignity in Dying says terminally ill adults such as Fiona should have the right to die on their own terms. A spokesman told the Mirror: “Nobody deserves to die in pain, suffering and without dignity. For most people, palliative care is excellent and will be able to give the vast majority of us a good death.  But for some people, like Fiona, even the very best care cannot prevent them having a bad death. We believe that dying people should be given the option of having an assisted death if they want to take control in their final days and have the good ending they deserve. The Margaret Centre is a specialist palliative care unit that provides care and support for people affected by life-limiting illnesses like cancer. Barts Health NHS Trust offered its deepest condolences to Fiona\u0027s family. A spokeswoman told  in June: This was a very sad case and we offer our deepest condolences to Ms Strong’s family. Ms Strong attended The Margaret Centre to relieve agitation she was experiencing as a result of her serious illness. Although we increased Ms Strong’s sedation to relieve agitation as safely as we could she did experience some consciousness in her final days.  Our priority is always to relieve any distress to patients throughout their illness and at the end of their life, and we will always strive to involve patients and their families in deciding the appropriate medication to meet their needs. Fiona was laid to rest in a scuba diving-themed coffin in May. Her guests celebrated her inspirational life with champagne and laughter. She wanted to be cremated, said Susan.  She said wherever we travel in the world, to sprinkle a bit of her. She said she felt she still had one long holiday left in her. She just enjoyed life. Abbie and Sally had initially aimed to raise awareness and funds for research into sarcoma , which has devastated too many lives, with their bike ride. They also wanted to give Fiona something to focus on and laugh at. But since her death, the challenge, dubbed \u0027LEJOG\u0027, has become something much more special and symbolic to us personally and those that knew her. It is a time to raise money, awareness and also to reflect on having had such a great friend in our life and a reminder to embrace the time we have in this world, the pals said. They are raising money for the Fiona Strong Memorial Fund, which was recently set up to provide vital support to those in need in Surrey. The fund aims to award grants to local non-profit organisations who provide support to the homeless, disadvantaged people and their relatives. And it will do so in Fiona\u0027s loving memory.

She was recently snapped sipping on champagne with hubby Prince Harry so it\u0027s unlikely she\u0027s expecting yet. However, etiquette experts say there is one crucial sign we should be looking out for that could reveal that she\u0027s pregnant. They reckon the big giveaway sign is all to do with her hair.  Naturally, Meghan has beautiful tightly-curled locks that she has styled into a sleek, glossy mane. In the past, she has said she chooses to have Brazilian blow dries, which smoothen and straighten out the hair. In 2011, she said: My mum is black and my dad is Dutch and Irish, so the texture of my hair is densely curly. I’ve been getting Brazilian blowouts for a couple of years. Speaking to the Sun , Myka Meier, who runs Plaza Hotel\u0027s Duchess Effect etiquette courses, said that although we don\u0027t know exactly what products and process she uses on her hair, it\u0027s likely keratin or a Brazilian treatment.  She added: “As soon as she gets pregnant she will no longer be able to use those same products, which could be very interesting. “I use the same products because I am quarter African and have very curly, frizzy hair and when I got pregnant I had to stop using all of those.” Apparently once we see Meghan opting to tie her hair up in ponytails and buns - this is a key sign she may be expecting. The reason is, straightening treatments contain chemicals that she may not be able to use once she is pregnant. For example, some Brazilian blow dries use formaldehyde to penetrate cuticles and make strands super glossy.  Anything containing this chemical should be approached with caution - but particularly for mums-to-be. Hair treatments like the Brazilian blow dry tend to last around three months - so keep an eye out on whether the Duchess starts to change her look. Different variations of the treatment are available in most hair salons these days - your average keratin smoothing treatment costs between \u0026pound100 and \u0026pound200 in the UK. There\u0027s also another sign that little ones are on the cards for Harry and Meghan.  As a wedding gift, the Queen gave the newlyweds Adelaide Cottage, which is located on the property of Windsor Castle. Although there is no baby bump blossoming just yet - renovations there raised eyebrows, as the plans supposedly included not one but TWO nurseries.

The ex-Hollywood lighting director, 74, has told pals he expected Meghan , Samantha and Thomas Jr to help pay for his retirement but complained he had not received a “f***ing dime”. It comes after his ex-wife Doria Ragland was reportedly preparing to move to London to be close to her daughter, 37, and son-in-law Harry, 33. One source told the Daily Mirror: “While he was working, Tom supported all his children. He was generous.  “But he made no secret that he expected in his dotage the money he spent on them would be repaid. “He says they have not given him a f***ing dime back. He is growing increasingly bitter about it, and it has not been helped by how his ex-wife, Meghan’s mum, has been so welcomed into the royal fold. The fact she could be moving to England has not helped the situation while he is in a pokey home in Mexico.” Mr Markle has already revealed he had expected Meghan to look after him. He said: “I took care of my mother for the last five years of her life. “My daughter said she’d take care of me in my declining years. I’m not talking money, I’m talking about taking care of me. That’s important to me.”  However, the Duchess of Sussex and her dad have been estranged for three months. Matters came to a head when Mr Markle slammed the phone down on Harry during a heated phone call. The row came after Mr Markle was found to have lied to his soon-to-be \u0026shyson-in-law by denying colluding with a paparazzi to cash in on staged pictures days before the May 19 wedding. This was the latest in a stream of “dad disappointments” Meghan is said to have endured since she left home to go to university. However, we can reveal Mr Markle’s resentment over money is what initially drove a wedge between him and his children after he retired seven years ago. The Emmy winner, who worked on smash hit sitcom Married With Children, is said to have earned more than six figures each year during his career.  He also reportedly won $750,000 on the California State Lottery in 1990. Mr Markle gifted cash from the windfall to all his children while funding Meghan’s private education. After retiring, he moved from LA to Mexico, in part because of the cheaper lifestyle. Today he rents a $695-a-month – \u0026pound500 – home in Rosarito close to the US border. Despite cutting his costs, he declared himself bankrupt in California in 2016, with \u0026pound24,181 in credit card debts and savings of just \u0026pound160. Meanwhile, friends say Mr Markle is angry that Meghan’s mother has apparently been treated more favourably by the Royal Family than he has. Although the Prince has yet to meet his father-in-law, Doria has seen Harry on several occasions.  The 61-year-old yoga teacher has maintained a dignified silence since news of Meghan’s relationship with Harry emerged two years ago. Yet Mr Markle has publicly attacked his daughter and Doria is said to be furious his other children – Samantha, 53, and Thomas Jr, 51 – have “trashed” their half-sister. Sources say Meghan was also deeply hurt when she discovered her father had been cashing in on her \u0026shyrelationship by staging photos with paparazzi. That revelation was followed by Mr Markle pulling out of attending his daughter’s wedding, due to a heart attack.

A top judge ordered Seventy Thirty Ltd return the fee to Tereza Burki, 47, after it was unable to find her \u0027the man of her dreams and possibly the father of her child\u0027, she told the High Court. She said the agency assured her it only dealt in creme de la creme matches and could introduce her to bachelors you dream of meeting. When she signed up with the agency in 2014, Ms Burki\u0027s requirements for the men she wanted to meet were not modest, Judge Richard Parkes QC said. She wanted a wealthy man with a lifestyle similar or more affluent than her own and, ideally, multiple residences. But the most important factor for Ms Burki, who lives in Lennox Gardens, Chelsea, where homes sell for millions, was that her soulmate would be prepared to have more children, as she wanted four.  But today Mr Parkes ordered the agency to repay her fee, ruling that she had been deceived by Seventy Thirty\u0027s then managing director. He told the court: Gertrude Stein quipped that whoever said money can\u0027t buy happiness didn\u0027t know where to shop. This case is about a woman looking for romantic happiness who says she was tricked into shopping in the wrong place, paying a large sum to a dating which, she says, made promises but failed to produce the goods. Upholding Ms Burki\u0027s claim , he ruled the agency\u0027s then managing director, Lemarc Thomas, guilty of deceit in misleading her. Although the agency boasted of more than 7,000 members, the truth was that only about 100 of them were men actively looking for love, he said. And the management consultant would never have paid her money and joined up had Mr Thomas not knowingly given her a wholly false impression.  Agency founder, Susie Ambrose, said Seventy Thirty had successfully matched over 6,000 lonely hearts and 63 babies had been born since she set it up in 2011. But the judge said Mr Thomas had told Ms Burki that there were a substantial number of wealthy men on the agency\u0027s books, actively looking for matches. She had no means of checking the truth of what he told her, and no reason to doubt it, he added. And she relied on Mr Thomas\u0027s word before spending a large amount of money on a dating agency in the hope of finding a partner who would give her a fourth child. The Knightsbridge-based agency claimed to have about 1,500 active members and that Ms Burki had been sent five potential matches that fit her requirements soon after joining. But the judge said: My conclusion from the evidence is that there are at the very most perhaps 200 active members of Seventy Thirty, and probably fewer. That points to a maximum of around 100 active male members.

The current change in the jet stream’s direction will allow low pressure to become dominant for a few days before higher pressure returns and the weather system alters course again. The mercury will drop as low as 13C in Scotland and the north east over the next few days - coming only weeks after scorching temperatures of 35C were seen across large parts of the country. The Met Office warned that Britain could see a sweeping of heavy showers and strong winds from tonight until at least the weekend. Today the east of England and Scotland have been battered by thunderstorms and some torrential downpours - but they are set to move south wards as the week goes on.  We\u0027ve got some unsettled weather continuing for the next few days, the Met Office\u0027s Luke Miall said. Quite a contrast really to what much of this summer has seen across the UK. The Met Office said rain that has been battering Scotland, northern England and northwest Wales will continue to push southeastwards tonight bringing heavy outbreaks for most of the country. Tomorrow there will be rain across parts of England and Wales, with sunny spells.  There will be some scattered, possibly thundery, showers in the north and west. Over the weekend it will be cloudy and windy with patches of heavy rain for the north and west of the country. It will be drier and brighter in the south and east but there is also potential for scattered showers. Waves or ripples along the jet stream can force Atlantic depressions to deepen violently as they are driven towards the UK, so they play a very important part in forecasting.

Christopher Paetkau, from Winnipeg, was heading from Yellowknife in Canada to Inuvik on Sunday where he boarded a flight to Iqaluit.  Taking to Twitter , the filmmaker said: Somehow I managed to go on the exact wrong airplane going in the wrong direction. I ended up thousands of kilometres east of Inuvik - that\u0027s pretty far in the wrong direction.  But rather than be angry about the 14 hour journey, he said that he had become \u0027buds\u0027 with the flight attendants. Christopher, who also works as a wildlife photographer, said that he arrived at the airport in Yellowknife and the computers at the check-in desk were down, resorting in staff entering information manually.  He said: I\u0027m standing at Gate 4 and I see there was three airplanes that are sitting out there on the tarmac, and also three boarding calls happening simultaneously pretty much at Gate 4, and they\u0027re all final calls After being told to wait 15 minutes, he went to the ticket booth where they checked his ID and flight manifest and sent him onto the runway. So now I\u0027m following like a lemming, I\u0027m following the rest of the people who are going on this flight. Still a little confused by the situation, Christopher asked a flight attendant if he was on the flight plane as he boarded and was told that he was. Sending a few last minute messages before the plane took off, he was not paying attention to the announcements made by the pilot over the tannoy. After several hours, the plane landed in Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, making Christopher think that it was a stop along the way.  It wasn\u0027t until he asked another flight attendant on the First Air flight how long it would be before they arrived in Inuvik that he realised there was a mistake. He said: Her face just dropped, like completely dropped, she\u0027s like, \u0027What are you talking about? We\u0027re not going to Inuvik, we\u0027re going to Iqaluit\u0027.

We\u0027ve let a friend or family member borrow our phone for a seemingly innocent task and ended up regretting that decision. Typically it ends up with something embarrassing being posted on our social media or a whole load of weird and wonderful photos being added to your camera roll. But for one woman in Arizona, handing over her phone resulted in a rather large sum of her money being spent, without her knowledge. And it turns out the person who scammed her, was none other than her six-year-old daughter Kaitlin.   The day before the incident, Kaitlin\u0027s mum had let the child order a Barbie doll off of her Amazon account as a special treat.  Later on, the young girl had asked to borrow the phone to check on the delivery status of the doll. Her mum, being a trusting person, was happy to oblige her daughter\u0027s request.  But it turns out Kaitlin had an ulterior motive for wanting to go on Amazon .   The six-year-old decided to treat herself to $300 (\u0026pound236) worth of toys, video games and board games on the account, and it wasn\u0027t until the next day her family discovered what she had done. An Amazon delivery driver turned up at their home the next day and started unloading box after box from his van. The girl\u0027s mum was confused, and checked her account, seeing, much to her horror, pages and pages of orders.  Kaitlin\u0027s cousin, Ria Diyalou, shared a post about the incident on Twitter , which has now gone viral.     She said: My badass little cousin ordered $300 worth of toys w/o my aunt \u0026amp uncle knowing. This is a picture of how everyone found out. The picture showed Kaitlin stood by the Amazon van as the parcels were dropped off, a look of pure smugness on her tiny face. Clearly she had no regrets about what she had done.  Ria told Buzzfeed News : She knew exactly what she was doing when she did it. I was so surprised that a six-year-old knew how to do one-click, next-day shipping.

Harriet Nassali, 38, is alleged to have beheaded Siraje Kavuma, 53, with a machete after she had found a new man and wanted their relationship to blossom. She fled from the gruesome scene after digging a 3ft hole in the garden to bury her headless husband\u0027s corpse. Her daughter, horrified from what she had witnessed, alerted the neighbours on the outskirt of Uganda capital Kampala. This is reportedly not the first time Mrs Nassali has tried to kill her husband, as she had previously made alleged attempts to poison him.   Man charged with murder after ‘loving son, dad and brother’ found dead at Manchester home  The mum-of-four, 38 was later arrested after her suspected lover led cops to her hideout. The pair admitted to police that they had plotted to get rid of Siraje. The pair had been fighting over a disagreement on money to be used to by a plot of land. Police said: “Close family friends revealed the bitter history of how the deceased had given his wife Nassali 27 million Ugandan Shillings (\u0026pound5,700). One of his children had told officers about a male friend who had got close to their mum just days before their dad was murdered in the village of Lwesuubo.

Moussa got absolutely battered at times but his hold up play was great. Mendy worked his socks off up there.“But you have to work the keeper and they know that. It’s not that I’m having a go at them, they understand that.“I do think we need help in that department. There’s no guarantees I bring a striker in and he’s going to do better but we need to bring players in for those areas.“That being said we do work. The guys just need to slow down, the most important thing they need to do is make the keeper make a save.”As for the goal that won the game, Neil conceded after initial doubts he agreed Bobby Madden’s call to award a penalty against Genseric Kusunga for handling a Niall McGinn corner was correct.“Just to address the penalty, I’ve seen it, it’s a penalty,” he added.“At the time I wasn’t sure. I went to Bobby to get his opinion on it at the end of the game and regardless of how close Gensi is, he felt it was a penalty.

It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me. He is a good player, and we can build on it.“Everyone fought and we have to continue with that because if just one person loses a battle, we will have problems.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/Sam-Jones-in-the-crowd-for-Dundee-v-Aberdeen.jpg.jpg ","title":"rejected sam jones turns down dundee after talks with neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann has been hit with a blow in his bid to sign a goalscorer after he was turned down by Sam Jones.Dundee and Shrewsbury Town had agreed a five-figure fee and the 26-year-old saw was a Dens Park spectator in the directors\u0026#8217 box on Saturday as McCann\u0026#8217s men went down 1-0 to Aberdeen.But after considering a switch to the SPFL, he has now returned to the Shrews and trained with John Askey’s squad today.Although born in Barnsley, he has represented Wales youth at youth level.Jones only joined the Shrews in January after spells at National League outfit Gateshead and League Two Grimsby Town that saw him among the goals on a regular basis.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b62ca6beab62.jpg ","title":"roads to close and all xplore dundee bus services diverted for scottish independence rally","story":"\t\t\t\t\tXplore Dundee says that all of its buses will be diverted for the Scottish independence rally in the city.Dundee council has also announced a temporary traffic order affecting several roads with thousands expected in the city for Saturday\u0026#8217s march, which leaves Baxter Park at 12.45pm and finishes at Magdalen Green in the West End.The march, organised by the All Under One Banner, could bring the city centre to a halt with 2,300 folk declaring on Facebook that they will attend and another 4,200 interested.The procession route is Baxter Park (via the South West gates), Arbroath Road A929, Princes Street A929, King Street, Panmure Street, Meadowside, Albert Square, Reform Street, High Street, Nethergate, Marketgate A991, Nethergate, Perth Road, Roseangle and Magdalen Green.Xplore Dundee released a statement warning that severe disruption is expected.It said: \u0026#8220On Saturday 18 August, the \u0026#8216All Under One Banner\u0026#8217 march will proceed through Dundee (from Baxter Park to Magdalen Green via the City Centre).

After everything Zeke has been through, he died from such a tragic accident.”Zeke was born and raised in Douglas and went to St Saviour’s RC High School.A lover of motorbikes from a young age, he opened Balfour’s Bike Breakers in Perrie Street, Lochee, when he was 19.He first met Pamela in 1981, but his plans to impress her didn’t exactly go to plan.She said: “We just got talking and he offered to take me out on his motorbike, much to my mother and father’s disgust.“We actually had a smash and I ended up in hospital so that was quite a way to meet someone.”Zeke gained a stellar reputation in the city and beyond for his knowledge of and passion for motorbikes. But in 2000, he shut his shop to take his family on an adventure of a lifetime after being inspired by a documentary.The family sold their home and bought a campervan, spending more than a year travelling through France and Portugal before settling for a period in Murcia, Spain, where Zeke founded an international removals company.Zeke restarted his bike breakers when they returned to Douglas.But, in April 2016, he began to suffer a decline in his health.Pamela said: “He started to get a lump on his face and he thought it was toothache at first.“We found out it was non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cancer of the saliva gland.“He needed an operation and was in theatre for eight and a half hours. He had to undergo three surgeries.“He became very ill and we just thought that was going to be it. Then in March last year he went into remission.“Five week later, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I was operated on really quickly and they managed to remove it all. I had radiotherapy every day for four weeks and thankfully I was given the all clear.“I started to notice some changes in Zeke earlier this year – he was needing to drink more.“He had a full body scan and the doctor said the cancer had returned. That whole time was just absolutely heartbreaking for all of us.”As well as his family, Zeke’s biggest passion was motorbikes.

Olivia was really chuffed about it.“It did feel a little weird coming home, just because we know that everything is going to be different.”Olivia was reunited with her two sisters, Taylor and Billie, after five weeks apart.Senga said: “My other two girls were at home for five weeks, and we’re just trying to get back into the routine of spending time together as a family.“She’s really loved it, I can’t get peace and quiet now. But it’s been great for her to spend time with her little sister, and she’s happy to have them back.”The youngster was given the prognosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 14 months – the neurological condition causes constant stiffness and tightness of leg and arm muscles, making mobility difficult.The family had previously thought treatment in the US was the only option and had set about raising £70,000 when they received the good news that Olivia had been deemed an ideal candidate for the operation in Bristol.Olivia is currently gearing up to go back to school next Tuesday.Senga hopes that she’ll be ready to go back with her classmates, and says they’ll “play it by ear” for the first few weeks.She said: “We’ll just need to see how she gets on, and if she needs to reduce her time at school then that’s what we’ll do.”Senga hopes that the surgery will now make Olivia able to do things that her friends and classmates can.She said: “So much has changed for her, she can sit on a bench now, she can sit crossed legged, it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but it is for her.“It’s little steps, and it’s good for her that she can be part of that.“I know that sitting on a bench isn’t a big thing, but her sitting with her classmates is a big thing for her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen gym undergoing 21000 revamp","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen sports centre is currently undergoing a modernisation project.The Beacon Centre in Bucksburn is the latest facility operated by Sport Aberdeen to benefit from improvements.The £21,000 works to the centre started on Monday and are anticipated to take a week to finish.The facility, which is located within the Bucksburn Community Campus, currently includes space for gym and fitness class venues, a large multi-activity sports hall, dance studio and squash courts.As well as fitness areas, it also has meeting rooms, a youth drop-in centre and a creche.Upgrades being carried out include the existing gym being refitted, with new Pulse Fitness cardio and resistance equipment installed.

Right at the very start, it was a blank canvas.“Beechgrove was going to be out there, in the back garden. The rest is history, as they say.”In the special anniversary programme, Beechgrove’s humble beginnings in Aberdeen is shown, when the garden was a small, difficult-to-manage patch of land.The scenario mirrored what many first-time gardeners in the 70s experienced when they moved out of tenements and flats. Mr Macpherson said: “The dream team that started was Jim McColl and George Barron. It’s a bit like you don’t get one without the other. They were a perfectly balanced pair.“They didn’t always come to the same conclusions. They came from very different backgrounds.“Jim had done a bit of telly before, understood the medium a bit. In contrast to George who was just an ordinary gardener.”George joined Beechgrove at the age of 64, after retiring as head gardener at Pitmedden House, where he spent 30 years creating a formal French garden in the midst of rural Aberdeenshire.Jim said: “In the early days one of the funny things was, people would say to you: ‘What makes you think that you know all of this and you can present it out there and you’re doing the right thing?’“My answer to that was, Mr George Barron standing next to me. He’s got 60 years’ experience, I’ve got 40 years’ experience in horticulture.“That’s 100 years between us. If we cannae talk for three minutes about how to grow tatties – it’s a poor do.”The programme also addresses how Carole Baxter became the first woman to co-present a TV gardening show in the UK.She said: “I was asked to present and there were a couple of things that I said.“One of them was: ‘Oh you’ve got to be joking. You know I’m a female’. Because it was two men, it was Jim and George. And then it was Jim and Dick for two years – and I’m also English.”The show also revisits the antics and expert makeovers of the Hit Squad – which was responsible for the garden built back in 1996 when the Beechgrove first moved from the garden in Aberdeen city centre to the current site.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cash boost for lifeboats","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen lifeboat station has

Sharks in home and away friendlies before getting their Scottish National League East Conference campaign under way at home to Dundee Tigers on September 1.Produced by Dunamis Sports, the home kit is white, while the away offering is black.A third kit, to be worn in four Stuart Robertson Cup matches, takes on charity Charlie House’s orange colour.After those games, the player-only shirts will be auctioned off – this will be the only way for fans to get hold of one.Lynx chairman Martin Hill said: “To say that I am pleased with the shirts would be a massive understatement. Dunamis Sportswear have really helped us come up with a striking set of tops that have fantastic impact and will look great both on the ice and off it.“A lot of thought went into the design process, with the subtle curves on the striping at the base of the shirt chosen to represent the beach-side location of the Linx Ice Arena, as well as a nod to the importance of the ocean to Aberdeen over the centuries.“It also showcases our fantastic set of local and national sponsors who have got behind the club for the coming season – and more are still to come on the new short covers, which are arriving soon “Hill added: “Of course, the orange-dominated design will get our fans talking, as it is a major departure from the traditional club colours of white, black and red.“This has been created in the colours of our chosen charity, Charlie House, for the players only, and is to be worn for the four home matches in the Stuart Robertson Cup competition, which begins the season.“After the fourth game in that competition, against Murrayfield Racers, each and every one of the shirts will be auctioned to raise money for Charlie House – and that is the only way our supporters or sponsors, will be able to get their hands on one of these limited edition shirts, by raising what I hope will be a lot of money for a fantastic local charity.”Hampshire-based Dunamis Sports made last year’s Lynx junior kits.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tech savvy feis an tairbeirt gives musicians a professional edge","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/08/18, 7:29 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Fèis an Tairbeirt workshop in music production, funded by Argyll and Bute Council\u0026#8217s Supporting Communities Fund, has been voted a success.Students recorded and produced their own tracks, created soundscapes with pre-recorded sounds, composed soundtracks and provided voiceovers for pieces of film and media during the three-day event.The chance to develop these skills is not usually offered outside of higher education but thanks to the knowledge and experience of tutor Luke Schofield, Fèis an Tairbeirt was able to offer this unique opportunity to local young adults.Another course has been arranged for September 15 and 16 and is limited to six places.The course is free but anyone interested should email feisantairbeirt@gmail to book a place.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

We look forward to VisitScotland accepting our proposals and working with us to ensure a smooth transfer of the facility over the coming weeks.\u0026#8216A lot of work will need to be carried out before the transfer and anyone wishing to volunteer should get in touch through our website.\u0026#8217A VisitScotland spokesman said: \u0026#8216We are currently in discussions with Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust about proposals for future use of the property and have the support of the local community.\u0026#8217Tarbert businessman Ian Macintyre believes the transfer of the premises should be a formality. He told the Advertiser: \u0026#8216In the original constitution for the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist board, the last paragraph is that in the event of this situation, any assets should transferred to an appropriate local body. I think that should still hold.\u0026#8217The trust\u0026#8217s asset transfer plan is backed by Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, who said: \u0026#8216I made it clear when this plan was first announced that there would have to be alternatives in place before any closure. That remains my position and I am concerned that, for example, there is still no fast mobile phone speeds and broadband in some parts of the area which are necessary to get information from the developing providers.\u0026#8216I have been supporting the proposal from the community trust for the Tarbert premises and I am hopeful that there can be an asset transfer, not least because it seems that the building was only given to VisitScotland on the understanding that if it stopped using it, it would revert to another body doing the same sort of work.\u0026#8217Councillor Alastair Redman added: \u0026#8216I would support the Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust in their talks to ask for an asset handover and take over the tourist centre building.\u0026#8217VisitScotland states that tourist information provision will continue across Argyll and Bute through a network of more than 130 VisitScotland Information Partners (VIPs) primarily based in hotels and guest houses, with three of these in Tarbert, four in Campbeltown and two in Inveraray, alongside \u0026#8216outreach\u0026#8217 staff attending events around the country.\u0026#8216It’s going to be a big miss in the village. I don’t know what they’re trying to do to small places.\u0026#8217 Flora Shaw, Earra Gael gift shop.\u0026#8216It’s terrible, because we get people coming in here asking us for information.

It\u0026#8217s mad even if it was just simply for the limited hours in October but we definitely need something in the summer months.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m not happy about it. They are a mine of information and when it closes I don’t know what we\u0026#8217ll do because our internet signal is so sketchy around here.\u0026#8217 Christine Entwistle, Harbour Gallery.\u0026#8216I think it’s a great pity.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united reject 150000 bid","story":"NewsAyr United reject £150,000 bid for striker Lawrence ShanklandUnited directors are holding firm in their bid to keep hold of the highly rated striker.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:09, 7 AUG 2018NewsShankland is a man in demand (Image: SNS Group)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have today rejected an offer of \u0026pound150,000 for star striker Lawrence Shankland.

The big bird was scoffing the chips close to the Gaiety Theatre in Ayr. A grainy image of the pointless attack has only now emerged. The man is wearing what looks like a white short sleeved shirt, black trousers and white training shoes. He is seen lifting his right leg back and then battering the chip-loving gull. Any kick to a creature like this would have left it in a very painful condition or at worst cause it to die from internal injuries. The chips had already been dropped on the ground close to the junction of Carrick Street and Boswell Park and it is not been regarded as a case where the gull actually stole the grub. Ironically the bird’s attacker was also eating his own portion of takeway food. The grainy image looks to have been taken from mobile phone footage. It appears to be right outside a late night food takeaway. The bird-brained incident took place on Saturday July 28 and only yesterday (Tuesday) was it able to be made public. An undercover inspector from the charity’s special investigations unit has been working on the case. He said: “We are being assisted by Police Scotland in our investigation and we would like to trace the individual involved. “I would urge anyone who recognises him to get in touch. “ Any information given to our animal helpline is treated confidentially and can be given nonymously. “Recently we have been made aware of a number of incidents involving attacks on seagulls and would like to remind the public that gulls, like all other birds, are protected by law. “We’d encourage the public to clear up any rubbish as gulls are attracted to it as they look for food.” Anyone who thinks they know the lout or remember him from that Saturday should call the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999. Ayr is in the middle of a seagull crisis at the moment with some of them attacking people including a prominent lawyer who had to fight off the attack using a rolled up copy of the Ayrshire Post. He was pecked on the top of his head in Burns Statue Square and the attack drew blood.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsPolice Scotland"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13080662.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_090818LABOUR_07JPG.jpg","title":"scottish labour leader richard leonard","story":"NewsScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard stops off in Doon ValleyHe made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet13:53, 14 AUG 2018NewsLabour leader Richard Leonard visited Dalmellington (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRichard Leonard went on a charm offensive in an area that was once a Labour heartland. And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre. Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived.

Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work. Miss Jane Fergusson executed some remarkable wood carvings in St Andrew\u0026rsquos church and was instrumental in forming a local branch of the Band of Mercy.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-actor-lands-starring-role-in-theatre-royal-programme","story":"ACTORS from across the UK applied in their hundreds for the highly-regarded Theatre Royal education programme.\nAnd following a demanding audition process, one budding thespian from Melrose landed one of the 18 starring roles.\nAlexander Cowan will now embark on a year-long course of mentoring by top industry professionals, which in the past has included Royal Shakespeare Company voice coach Michael Corbridge and Ros Steen, the former head of vocal training at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.\nSome of the acting world\u0026rsquos most famous names have trodden the boards at Newcastle\u0027s Theatre Royal including Dame Judy Dench and Sirs Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart.\nAlexander is delighted to be joining them.

Four examples of these keeps survive in a ruinous state around Innerleithen and Traquair.\nThe walls themselves cannot speak so I have turned to Innerleithen \u0026amp Traquair, Past and Present, with an Angler\u0026rsquos Guide to the Tweed and its Tributaries (Second Edition \u0026ndash 1867), commonly called Smail\u0026rsquos Guide as it was published by Innerleithen printer Robert Smail.\nElibank Castle: \u0026ldquoAbout a mile east of Bold is Juniper Bank, near which \u0026ndash a considerable way up the hill \u0026ndash is the ruin of Elibank Tower, the ancient seat of the Murrays of Elibank, and famous for the story of Muckle-mouthed Meg, in which young Scott of Harden figured so conspicuously. (Smail\u0026rsquos Guide, pp. 96)\nCardrona Tower: \u0026ldquo...Cardrona was for many ages...the property of a family of the name of Govan, chiefs of the name, one of whom, Laurence of Govan, was Sheriff of Traquair in 1358. They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh. (Smail\u0026rsquos Guide, pp. 104-105)\nHorsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquoAccordingly, as it was then uninhabited [1775], and, from its condition, not likely to become again a family residence, he [an unnamed neighbour who wished to buy the castle] requested permission to improve it according to his taste. This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

reforms, with around one in four entries expected to be awarded the highest grades.\nYoungsters who are still seeking university places are likely to face a wealth of choice as institutions scramble to attract good candidates on to their degree courses.\nUniversity leaders suggested that there could be more people who are using Clearing this year to apply to university for the first time.\nThe head of the new higher education watchdog has urged institutions to award Clearing places \u0026ldquowith the student\u0026rsquos interests at heart, rather than simply to fill courses.\nA Press Association snapshot survey suggests that the day before results were due to be released, more than 26,000 courses were available in clearing for students in England only.\nMore than half a million students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving A-level results today.\nLast year, 26.3% of A-levels scored an A or A*, national figures showed.\nThe results are likely to be broadly similar again this year.\nThere have been major changes to A-levels in England, with a move away from coursework and modular exams throughout the course.\nLast year the first grades were awarded in the first 13 subjects to be reformed in England and, among these subjects alone, the proportion of entries scoring at least an A grade fell by 0.7 percentage points to 24.3%.\nA further 11 subjects have been reformed with the first grades awarded today.\nAmanda Brown, deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, argued that A-level changes means that students are unable to fully demonstrate what they can do.\n\u0026ldquoChanging the assessment of A-levels so they focus on high-stakes exams taken at the end of two years of study does not allow students to properly demonstrate their ability and puts them under huge pressure, she said.\n\u0026ldquoCoursework and other non-exam assessments are a better way for students to demonstrate their skills, are less of a memory test, and help lower attaining students and those with special educational needs and disabilities show their achievements.\nOne expert has suggested that the proportion of top grades\u0026nbsp could drop slightly, by less than a percentage point, due to changes to the exam system, and a major hike in the number of unconditional offers handed out by universities.\nMitigating this are a number of factors, including processes put in place by England\u0026rsquos exams regulator Ofqual to ensure that results are comparable and the first cohorts of students to take new courses are not disadvantaged, Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Buckingham said.\nFor those looking for degree places through Clearing this summer, there are suggestions that they are likely to find it is a buyers\u0026rsquo market.\nThe Press Association\u0026rsquos survey shows that, as of Wednesday, 26,350 undergraduate courses were showing up on the Ucas clearing website for students in England.\nNine in 10 UK institutions have at least one course listed in Clearing, the survey found.\nIt also shows that three quarters of Russell Group universities, often considered among the best in the country, have at least one course in Clearing, with almost 4,500 courses listed in total.\nThe numbers of courses listed change frequently as different courses are filled, or become available.\nAt the same point last year, the day before results day, there were around 27,715 undergraduate courses in total listed on Clearing with potential availability for students in England.\nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the new Office for Students, said it was important students have both the ability and the support they need to access and succeed on a degree course.\n\u0026ldquoWhile universities often allow students in with lower grades than advertised, it is important they do so with the student\u0026rsquos interests at heart, she told The Times.\nProfessor Alex Neill, vice-president for education at the University of Southampton said that, nationally, there may be fewer people in Clearing this year for a variety of reasons, including a decline in the population of school leavers.\nBut he added that there could be more people in Clearing who have not applied to university through the main application scheme.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of a further trend that\u0026rsquos developed over the last few years, we do expect to see more students in Clearing who haven\u0026rsquot previously applied to university so an increase in the number of people who are, in fact, using Clearing as their entry to university, he said.\n\u0026ldquoWe have evidence that prospective students are receiving advice not to make a decision or application \u0026lsquoearly\u0026rsquo, in the Ucas cycle, but use Clearing as a time when they will still be able to get entry to a high quality university and a high quality course, keeping their options open rather than pinning themselves down early.\nLindsay Neil, director of admissions at the University of Westminster, said: \u0026ldquoTraditionally, prospective students apply to universities, receive offers and choose their first and second choice.\n\u0026ldquoThey then have a long wait for their results to see if they have been successful or not.\n\u0026ldquoIf unsuccessful students would then use Clearing as a back-up option to find universities who have courses with vacancies.\n\u0026ldquoNow however, the demographics are changing.\n\u0026ldquoThe number of 18-year-olds applying for university is at a low point creating a \u0026lsquobuyers\u0026rsquo market\u0026rsquo.\n\u0026ldquoThe majority of universities now open at least some courses in Clearing and this gives students a big advantage.\n\u0026ldquoThey can now wait to see their results before applying to university, using Clearing as a first and faster application route.\n\u0026ldquoOften courses will reduce their entry requirements for Clearing, making it an attractive option.\n\u0026ldquoIt is not \u0026lsquorisk free\u0026rsquo however, as popular courses can still be full, but Clearing is becoming a method of choice, not necessity.\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe reformed A-levels after universities told us they were failing to prepare students for higher education.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the number of exams students have to sit will give them more time for study and to gain a deeper understanding of the courses they are studying, an essential skill for undergraduate study.\n\u0026ldquoWe know exam season can be a

across the Great Barrier Reef has been happening for around 400 years, a study has revealed.\nResearchers from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh have dated the phenomenon back four centuries by examining cores extracted from old corals.\nLarge-scale coral bleaching has raised concern about the future of the ecosystems and the impact their loss could have on biodiversity.\nThe teams found the frequency of bleaching has increased since the 1800s and, despite corals\u0026rsquo ability to recover,\u0026nbspthere are fears they could now be approaching a \u0026ldquocritical threshold.\nDr Nick Kamenos from Glasgow\u0026rsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear in the core data we examined that bleaching has been occurring on the Great Barrier Reef for at least 400 years, but the frequency of bleaching events has increased markedly since the early 1800s and those events have affected 10% more corals since the late 1700s.\n\u0026ldquoWe can see that corals have been able to acclimate and recover from past bleaching events.\n\u0026ldquoHowever, the increase in bleaching frequency and the numbers of corals affected since temperatures started consistently increasing in the modern era raises serious concerns about whether corals are approaching a critical threshold beyond which their long-term survival is uncertain.\nResearchers gained insights from x-rays of corals hundreds of years old (University of Glasgow/PA)\nBleaching occurs when water temperatures rise too high and disrupt the relationship between the coral and the tiny algae living inside it.\nWhen the algae are expelled, it leaves the coral a stark white. They\u0026nbspcan be reabsorbed when the water temperature drops again, but corals die if this separation is too long.\nDr Sebastian Hennige from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos School of Geosciences said: \u0026ldquoFor this study we used the most conservative methods we could in some of the toughest corals out there today.\n\u0026ldquoThe fact that we are seeing an increase in bleaching even in these tough corals highlights just how serious the threat of coral bleaching is, and how important it is that we take action now to reduce this threat.\nThe paper, titled Reconstructing four centuries of temperature-induced coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, is published in the journal Frontiers.\nThe study was supported by funding from the Natural Environment Research Council, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Scottish Government.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

world fuel costs this year through increases to home heating oil of almost 50% and the cost of diesel at the pumps which has risen by 15%.\nThe regulator added: \u0026ldquoIt is a fact that global energy markets are volatile.\n\u0026ldquoLooking back at the last five years there have been two Power NI tariff increases, two decreases and one year where prices were frozen.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst the

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-and-crusaders-chase","story":"  Lots of events are still to come, including tomorrow\u0027s fancy dress parade and the Rideout on Saturday.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.

It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.

Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial. Its \u0026lsquolife expectancy\u0026rsquo is approximately 50 years."},{"url":null,"title":"famous-old-east-lothian-football-club-revived","story":"  The newly revived Wallyford Bluebell football team has already won the John Whyte Memorial Trophy, awarded to the champions of the five-a-side tournament hosted by Musselburgh Athletic Football Club at Olive Bank during the Musselburgh Festival.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.

Many teenagers will have their plans already fixed, with university and college places secured, or jobs lined up.  But for others, be your grades good or bad, there are still decisions to be made.  If you are disappointed, results day is likely to bring concern and worry.  At this stage, the widely accepted advice is to stay calm, not panic, and think through your options \u0026ndash of which there are many.  Are your grades below what you needed to confirm your university or college place?  Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says students should speak to their teachers if they are concerned about their results, and stay in touch to ensure they get advice and support.  \u0026ldquoWhere it\u0026rsquos problematic is where youngsters shoot off, he says. \u0026ldquoThey come in, they\u0026rsquore disappointed with their results and they disappear.  \u0026ldquoThe advice always is that they ensure they are in communication with someone in their school or college so that we know exactly what is happening.          Good luck to everyone getting #ALevelResults on Thursday. Remember, #UCAS Track will update from 08:00 Thursday morning. Please RT!          \u0026mdash UCAS Online (@ucas_online) August 12, 2018  Staff will be on hand to give appropriate advice to students, Mr Trobe says, adding \u0026ldquosome of it is simply to ring the university if they have gone under the grades required.  \u0026ldquoIt will be to ring the university and to follow up just to find out if they have got in or not. Because often youngsters can get it in if they miss by two or three grades.  \u0026ldquoIt depends on the attitude of the university, he adds.  Students who do not get into their first, or insurance choice of degree can use the Ucas Clearing system to search for available courses.  There have been suggestions that Clearing will be a buyers\u0026rsquo market for students this year, with almost all universities expected to advertise places.  It is likely that there will be courses available in subjects ranging from languages and the humanities to the sciences and engineering, each asking for different grade requirements.  Clare Marchant, Ucas chief executive, says: \u0026ldquoIf your grades end up being different from what you expected, it\u0026rsquos important not to jump into making a decision.  \u0026ldquoMake the right choice for you. It can help to talk your thoughts through with family, friends, a teacher, or careers adviser.  \u0026ldquoIf you decide to look for courses in Clearing, there are fewer 18-year-olds in the UK\u0026rsquos population, so there\u0026rsquos never been a better time to search for opportunities.  While some will experience disappointment come results day, others may find they have surpassed their own expectations.  Many will go ahead with the plans they have already made, but there are other options open if you find yourself thinking about the opportunities available to you.  The Ucas adjustment service is for students who meet and exceed the grade requirements for their original degree choice and are considering swapping to another course.  It allows students to look at other options without losing their original university offer \u0026ndash you\u0026rsquoll need to talk to the university you\u0026rsquore interested in about any possible vacancies on the course you want.  University is not for everyone, and there are plenty of alternatives for those who don\u0026rsquot see themselves studying for a degree.  Many firms have their own apprenticeship programmes, or you could look at a degree apprenticeship \u0026ndash a new education route that combines working with university study.  There are also many technical and vocational qualifications that you could consider.  Kirstie Donnelly, managing director of City \u0026amp Guilds and ILM, says: \u0026ldquoNow more than ever, young people have access to an array of different routes into education and employment.  While academic qualifications are the right route for many, they should not be seen as the only way to get a job or have a successful career, she says.  \u0026ldquoOur recent research has highlighted that the UK faces a significant shortfall of skilled and talented people, with ongoing uncertainty around Brexit set to exacerbate this.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos essential that young people understand the full range of options ahead of them, which can pave a way into industries including engineering, construction, hospitality, media or the built environment sector.  Whether your results are good or bad, you may also be considering a gap year \u0026ndash a chance to gain new skills, experience the workplace, or travel.

University leaders suggested that there could be more people who are using Clearing this year to apply to university for the first time.  The head of the new higher education watchdog has urged institutions to award Clearing places \u0026ldquowith the student\u0026rsquos interests at heart, rather than simply to fill courses.  A Press Association snapshot survey suggests that the day before results were due to be released, more than 26,000 courses were available in clearing for students in England only.  More than half a million students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving A-level results today.  Last year, 26.3% of A-levels scored an A or A*, national figures showed.  The results are likely to be broadly similar again this year.  There have been major changes to A-levels in England, with a move away from coursework and modular exams throughout the course.  Last year the first grades were awarded in the first 13 subjects to be reformed in England and, among these subjects alone, the proportion of entries scoring at least an A grade fell by 0.7 percentage points to 24.3%.  A further 11 subjects have been reformed with the first grades awarded today.  Amanda Brown, deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, argued that A-level changes means that students are unable to fully demonstrate what they can do.  \u0026ldquoChanging the assessment of A-levels so they focus on high-stakes exams taken at the end of two years of study does not allow students to properly demonstrate their ability and puts them under huge pressure, she said.  \u0026ldquoCoursework and other non-exam assessments are a better way for students to demonstrate their skills, are less of a memory test, and help lower attaining students and those with special educational needs and disabilities show their achievements.  One expert has suggested that the proportion of top grades\u0026nbsp could drop slightly, by less than a percentage point, due to changes to the exam system, and a major hike in the number of unconditional offers handed out by universities.  Mitigating this are a number of factors, including processes put in place by England\u0026rsquos exams regulator Ofqual to ensure that results are comparable and the first cohorts of students to take new courses are not disadvantaged, Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Buckingham said.  For those looking for degree places through Clearing this summer, there are suggestions that they are likely to find it is a buyers\u0026rsquo market.  The Press Association\u0026rsquos survey shows that, as of Wednesday, 26,350 undergraduate courses were showing up on the Ucas clearing website for students in England.  Nine in 10 UK institutions have at least one course listed in Clearing, the survey found.  It also shows that three quarters of Russell Group universities, often considered among the best in the country, have at least one course in Clearing, with almost 4,500 courses listed in total.  The numbers of courses listed change frequently as different courses are filled, or become available.  At the same point last year, the day before results day, there were around 27,715 undergraduate courses in total listed on Clearing with potential availability for students in England.  Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the new Office for Students, said it was important students have both the ability and the support they need to access and succeed on a degree course.  \u0026ldquoWhile universities often allow students in with lower grades than advertised, it is important they do so with the student\u0026rsquos interests at heart, she told The Times.  Professor Alex Neill, vice-president for education at the University of Southampton said that, nationally, there may be fewer people in Clearing this year for a variety of reasons, including a decline in the population of school leavers.  But he added that there could be more people in Clearing who have not applied to university through the main application scheme.  \u0026ldquoAs part of a further trend that\u0026rsquos developed over the last few years, we do expect to see more students in Clearing who haven\u0026rsquot previously applied to university so an increase in the number of people who are, in fact, using Clearing as their entry to university, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe have evidence that prospective students are receiving advice not to make a decision or application \u0026lsquoearly\u0026rsquo, in the Ucas cycle, but use Clearing as a time when they will still be able to get entry to a high quality university and a high quality course, keeping their options open rather than pinning themselves down early.  Lindsay Neil, director of admissions at the University of Westminster, said: \u0026ldquoTraditionally, prospective students apply to universities, receive offers and choose their first and second choice.  \u0026ldquoThey then have a long wait for their results to see if they have been successful or not.  \u0026ldquoIf unsuccessful students would then use Clearing as a back-up option to find universities who have courses with vacancies.  \u0026ldquoNow however, the demographics are changing.  \u0026ldquoThe number of 18-year-olds applying for university is at a low point creating a \u0026lsquobuyers\u0026rsquo market\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThe majority of universities now open at least some courses in Clearing and this gives students a big advantage.  \u0026ldquoThey can now wait to see their results before applying to university, using Clearing as a first and faster application route.  \u0026ldquoOften courses will reduce their entry requirements for Clearing, making it an attractive option.  \u0026ldquoIt is not \u0026lsquorisk free\u0026rsquo however, as popular courses can still be full, but Clearing is becoming a method of choice, not necessity.  A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe reformed A-levels after universities told us they were failing to prepare students for higher education.  \u0026ldquoReducing the number of exams students have to sit will give them more time for study and to gain a deeper understanding of the courses they are studying, an essential skill for undergraduate study.  \u0026ldquoWe know exam season can be a time of heightened emotions for pupils wanting to do their best but while testing has always been an important part of education, it should never be at the expense of a young person\u0026rsquos wellbeing.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why the Government is investing \u0026pound1.7 billion to promote, protect and improve young people\u0026rsquos mental health."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8221721.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coral-bleaching-dates-back-400-years-study","story":"  Researchers from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh have dated the phenomenon back four centuries by examining cores extracted from old corals.  Large-scale coral bleaching has raised concern about the future of the ecosystems and the impact their loss could have on biodiversity.  The teams found the frequency of bleaching has increased since the 1800s and, despite corals\u0026rsquo ability to recover,\u0026nbspthere are fears they could now be approaching a \u0026ldquocritical threshold.  Dr Nick Kamenos from Glasgow\u0026rsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear in the core data we examined that bleaching has been occurring on the Great Barrier Reef for at least 400 years, but the frequency of bleaching events has increased markedly since the early 1800s and those events have affected 10% more corals since the late 1700s.  \u0026ldquoWe can see that corals have been able to acclimate and recover from past bleaching events.  \u0026ldquoHowever, the increase in bleaching frequency and the numbers of corals affected since temperatures started consistently increasing in the modern era raises serious concerns about whether corals are approaching a critical threshold beyond which their long-term survival is uncertain.  Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise too high and disrupt the relationship between the coral and the tiny algae living inside it.  When the algae are expelled, it leaves the coral a stark white. They\u0026nbspcan be reabsorbed when the water temperature drops again, but corals die if this separation is too long.  Dr Sebastian Hennige from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos School of Geosciences said: \u0026ldquoFor this study we used the most conservative methods we could in some of the toughest corals out there today.  \u0026ldquoThe fact that we are seeing an increase in bleaching even in these tough corals highlights just how serious the threat of coral bleaching is, and how important it is that we take action now to reduce this threat.  The paper, titled Reconstructing four centuries of temperature-induced coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, is published in the journal Frontiers.  The study was supported by funding from the Natural Environment Research Council, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Scottish Government."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8057528.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"ni-electricity-prices-to-rise-by-14-from-october","story":"  The company blamed increases in the cost of wholesale electricity and said it was driven by rising fuel costs used in electricity generation, like gas.  A typical household using Power NI will see their annual bill rise from \u0026pound497 per year to \u0026pound565 per year, the Consumer Council said.  Stephen McCully, managing director of Power NI, said: \u0026ldquoPutting our prices up is the last thing we want to do, but unfortunately we are at the mercy of fluctuating world fuel prices.  \u0026ldquoGas, the main fuel used to generate electricity here, has increased significantly by 30% since we last set our prices.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove worked through a rigorous process with the Utility Regulator and our customers can be sure that although unwelcome, this increase is as low as possible and our prices are still cheaper than they were five years ago.

Consumers will have already seen this rise in world fuel costs this year through increases to home heating oil of almost 50% and the cost of diesel at the pumps which has risen by 15%.  The regulator added: \u0026ldquoIt is a fact that global energy markets are volatile.  \u0026ldquoLooking back at the last five years there have been two Power NI tariff increases, two decreases and one year where prices were frozen.  \u0026ldquoWhilst the Utility Regulator can provide relative stability in terms of the other regulated costs that make up a customer\u0026rsquos bill, fluctuations in wholesale energy costs are simply outside of our control."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8195899.jpg?htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-homebase-stores-to-shut-as-high-street-misery-continues","story":"  The Robroyston, Pollokshaws and East Kilbride branches will close, the company confirmed.

Mr Ross, who suffers from eye condition Stargardt disease, was working in the company\u0026rsquos Aberdeenshire brewery when he told bosses his eyesight had deteriorated and he was awaiting tests.  Despite reports from the RNIB and a specialist in visual impairment saying the 47-year-old could continue to work if some adjustments were made, Brewdog took the decision to dismiss him.  Mr Ross, from Fraserburgh, has now won his case for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination at an employment tribunal.  Speaking to the Herald, he said: \u0026ldquoThe way they dealt with my condition was really poor for a company of their size. The management just didn\u0026rsquot seem to have a clue how to deal with it, they just wanted to end it.  \u0026ldquoThey weren\u0026rsquot interested in making any changes, they just wanted me out.  \u0026ldquoBrewdog try to claim they\u0026rsquore this top company to work for, but I took this tribunal to show what they really are.  The tribunal heard that Mr Ross told the firm about his sight problems when he first started working for them in July 2016.  However, in January 2017 he told his manager that his vision was deteriorating.  He later provided Brewdog with a copy of a medical report stating that further tests were needed which would likely result in him being declared blind.  The company\u0026rsquos Health and Safety manager, John Fairclough, was asked to complete a risk assessment on Mr Ross and he was given a high risk rating.  An occupational health report was also ordered, which found that Mr Ross was not fit for work, but the tribunal found that this was not carried out by a medic with any expertise in visual impairment.  RNIB employment adviser Ruth Morrell then visited the brewery and recommended a number of changes that could allow him to keep working.  Mobility Officer Jeff Bligdon also visited the site and found that Mr Ross was still able to carry out his work without any difficulty.  In his report, Mr Bligdon stated: \u0026ldquoI felt that if [Brewdog] could end James\u0026rsquo employment with them, they would have done it there and then.  \u0026ldquoThe health and safety person was particularly negative towards James and came across as not wanting to adapt or try anything that would assist James.  Mr Ross was later sacked at a meeting in May after he rejected a computing role because it was harder for him to do with his eyesight problems.  The tribunal heard that managers involved in his case had no knowledge of the need to make adjustments for disabled people under the Equality Act.  Employment Judge Nick Hosie described this as \u0026ldquoastonishing.  The judge said that only \u0026ldquolip-service was paid to the law, while bosses also made \u0026ldquoblanket assumptions.  Judge Hosie added that Brewdog \u0026ldquoshould feel more than discomfort at the lack of awareness evidenced of their legal obligations to consider reasonable adjustments for an employee they recognised as disabled.  He urged the firm to ensure staff are now made aware of their legal requirements.

The Irishman\u0026rsquos lucrative hoodies, shorts and sweaters, which bear his signature in huge letters, must be withdrawn from sale or he will have to pay compensation to the McGregor fashion label.  It was founded by Scottish businessman David Doniger almost 100 years ago and is now owned by a Dutch company.  A hat maker by trade, Doniger was a member of Clan Gregor and started producing clothing using its official tartan.  He established the company when he emigrated to New York in 1921.  The District Court in The Hague ordered Adidas and its subsidiary Reebok, which sells the 30-year-old\u0026rsquos exclusive sports clothing line, to withdraw garments sold in Europe.  Following a high profile deal with the UFC, Reebok launched Conor McGregor\u0026rsquos popular clothing emblazoned with his name.  But the McGregor fashion label sought a court injunction against Adidas to force them to withdraw their garments.  Their legal team claimed the public could be confused into believing some of the products made by Reebok for the Dublin-born star was part of their McGregor label.  Lawyer Remco van Leeuwen said: \u0026ldquoThe public would be confused into believing that the clothing made by Reebok for the Irish mixed martial artist and boxer comes from the McGregor fashion house.  \u0026ldquoWe asked Reebok to stop selling the clothing that would confused the public but they refused.  Judges heard the clothing sold by Reebok \u0026ldquowas bound to be confusing to the public because it has McGregor in huge letters while \u0026lsquoConor\u0026rsquo is so minuscule you hardly see it.  In a written judgement, the court found in favour of the Scottish-inspired McGregor, ruling the signature name in big letters of the fighter on the hoodie, shorts and jersey were a contravention of trademark regulations because it was similar to that of the plaintiffs.  Part of the McGregor clan, Doniger could trace his roots back to the first kings of Scotland and, possessing both a keen eye for business and strong sense of style, he had made enough money for the voyage to America by making caps out of the McGregor tartan.  Once in the US, Doniger set up a business and introduced his Scottish plaids to New York and beyond.  In February 2013, senior figures at the UFC announced that they had signed McGregor as part of a multi-fight contract.  McGregor, who was born in the Crumlin area of Dublin, became only the second fighter from Ireland to compete for the company after Tom Egan."},{"url":null,"title":"no-second-independence-referendum-before-early-2020s-says-alex-neil","story":"  Alex Neil issued the \u0026ldquorealistic assessment despite being a speaker at next month\u0026rsquos Hope over Fear rally, which is backing a referendum as soon as possible.  Titled \u0026ldquothis time it\u0026rsquos yes, the organisers of the annual gathering in Glasgow\u0026rsquos George Square say they \u0026ldquosincerely believe it will be the last rally before Indyref2.  Illustrating splits in the Yes movement over the timing of a vote, Mr Neil said there was no serious prospect of Indyref2 before the 2021 election.  He said he had told one organiser, the former Socialist MSP and convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan, how he felt and that was the basis for him speaking on September 15.  Mr Neil, who held cabinet posts under both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, said Theresa May would not grant a Section 30 order giving Holyrood the necessary powers to hold a referendum, and the SNP also needed to do more to prepare the ground for independence.  The strategy should therefore be to seek a clear-cut mandate for a referendum in 2021.  He told the Herald: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think you can seriously call for a second referendum.  \u0026ldquoNicola has made it clear - in my view, correctly - that she would not call for a second referendum without a Section 30 order from London and quite frankly, as things stand, there\u0026rsquos no prospect of getting that before 2021.  \u0026ldquoWe should focus on preparing the ground, so that we can have a successful Indyref2 in the early 2020s.  The Airdrie \u0026amp Shotts MSP went on: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove made it clear what my position is to Tommy, and I\u0026rsquove accepted the invitation on the basis that that\u0026rsquos my position. We want to be independent as quickly as possible, but you\u0026rsquove also got to deal with the realities of life.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom absolutely convinced we can win one [a referendum], but I think the way things are, to get a Section 30 order, we will need to be very explicit in our 2021 manifesto that a vote for the SNP is a vote for Indyref2, and this time probably hold it earlier in the parliament rather than later.  He said that made the SNP government\u0026rsquos performance over the next three years \u0026ldquocritical in persuading people to get behind independence.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf the government adopts a successful strategy of delivering on health and education and jobs, that is a prerequisite of a successful outcome of Indyref2. There\u0026rsquos a lot of water to flow under the bridge between now and 2021.  Ms Sturgeon has said she has a \u0026ldquotriple-lock mandate to call a referendum in the current parliament, and is due to update MSPs on a timetable plans in October.  However she has also said a date requires far greater clarity over Brexit and future UK-EU trade relations, and acknowledged she does not know what she will say in the autumn.  After demanding a fresh referendum in March 2017, she was blindsided by a snap election in which the SNP lost a third of its MPs and had to \u0026ldquoreset her plans.  Mr Neil said the First Minister\u0026rsquos strategy must be flexible enough to cope with a \u0026ldquovery fluid political situation, including the possibility of another Westminster election this year or next.  But with wider Yes movement marches attracting tens of thousands, Ms Sturgeon also faces growing pressure to use her \u0026lsquotriple lock\u0026rsquo mandate before it expires.  Mr Neil said many of those agitating for a rapid referendum were doing so for the wrong reason - fear of Unionists winning a majority at Holyrood in 2021, rather than the conditions being right to win a Yes vote.  \u0026ldquoThey are concerned that we might not get a pro-independence majority in the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections. If you do it for that reason, it\u0026rsquos the wrong reason to do it.  \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquore not doing it because you think you can win the referendum, you\u0026rsquore doing it because you\u0026rsquore feart we\u0026rsquore not going to win the 2021 election.  \u0026ldquoThe answer to that is, do what you need to do to win the 2021 election to get the mandate to get Indyref2.  Also due to speak at the Hope Over Fear rally are SNP MSP Sandra White and Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny, who ran unsuccessfully for the SNP deputy leadership earlier this year.  Mr McEleny has repeatedly called for a referendum by the end of 2019.  Mrs May has rejected one call for a Section 30 order, and would doubtless do so again.  However a second rejection could be used by Ms Sturgeon as evidence of a democratic deficit and Westminster high-handedness in the run up to the 2021 election."},{"url":null,"title":"president-of-ireland-calls-for-culture-of-peace-on-anniversary-of-omagh-bomb","story":"  Twenty nine innocents, including a woman pregnant with twins, died when a massive car bomb ripped through the Co Tyrone town just months after the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement was supposed to have largely ended violence.  A splinter dissident republican group opposed to the peace process, the Real IRA, was blamed for the carnage after inaccurate warnings meant police evacuated shoppers towards the bomb site.  Twenty years later, nobody has been convicted of murder and relatives of the dead will gather on the spot this afternoon for a short ceremony\u0026nbspled by Omagh Churches Forum.  It will be followed by the ringing of a bell 32 times to reflect the 31 lives lost and an additional peal to remember all who have lost their lives through similar atrocities.  President Michael D Higgins said: \u0026ldquoAs we recall with deep sadness the deaths and the injuries at Omagh, we should use this moment to recognise the many ways in which we are all connected and the many ways in which we have sought to make peaceful progress over the last two decades.  \u0026ldquoMay we use this anniversary as we honour the victims, to re-emphasise the importance of building a culture of peace and tolerance on our island.  The victims included Protestants and Catholics, tourists from Spain and others on a day trip from the nearby Republic of Ireland.  One of the biggest police manhunts in history unfolded, but criticism of the police investigation led to unfulfilled calls for a public inquiry.  Two faced prosecution for murder but were not convicted.  Catholic Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown held a special Mass in the town on Tuesday evening.  He told parishioners at the Sacred Heart Church: \u0026ldquoYour memorial here is a monument to all the innocent who were torn from us by violence in our community.  \u0026ldquoCombatants do fighting but it is mostly civilians who do the dying.  Twenty years on, the Stormont power-sharing administration which was a centrepiece of the Belfast Agreement is suspended with little sign of its restoration.  Dissident republicans continue to pose a serious threat to life, primarily to members of the security forces.  Nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said: \u0026ldquoThe pain of Omagh families and victims should serve us with an important reminder that the road to peace is worth protecting at all costs.  He said the resilience of all affected provided the \u0026ldquoultimate example that reconciliation and agreement in the face of adversity was always possible.

Experts said the decreases are concerning and that the UK needs to \u0026ldquonurture a new generation of fluent speakers.  The Press Association\u0026rsquos analysis shows there were 17,505 applications to study European languages, literature and related courses last year, down 30% from 24,895 in 2007.  And applications for non-European languages, literature and related degrees have dropped by 38% to 5,515 last year \u0026ndash compared with 8,945 a decade ago.  The analysis looked at all applications made through Ucas\u0026rsquos main application scheme between 2007 and 2017.  The figures come just days before teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland learn their A-level results.  A gender breakdown shows that applications from boys to study European language courses have dropped by 27%, while for non-European languages the numbers are down 50%.  Among girls, applications have fallen by 31% for both European and non-European languages.  Mark Herbert, director of schools and skills at the British Council, said: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the UK is looking to forge new relationships around the world, it\u0026rsquos concerning that the number of young people applying for language degrees is actually declining.  \u0026ldquoWe need to nurture a new generation of fluent speakers, particularly in important languages such as Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, French and German, which our analysis shows will be crucial for the UK\u0026rsquos success post-Brexit.  \u0026ldquoHaving language skills and an understanding of other cultures gives graduates an advantage in the labour market, particularly when they are competing against people from other parts of the world who often speak excellent English \u0026ndash and have several other languages too.

The poll, commissioned by the Left Foot Forward website, found 41 per cent of those with a view said Mrs May and her negotiators would \u0026ldquobear the greatest responsibility, compared to 23 per cent who would blame the European Union.  Brexiter Tory MPs would be blamed by 15 per cent, and Remain Tory MPs by 8 per cent.  Labour, the LibDems, SNP and other opposition parties were seen as largely irrelevant, with just 6 per cent saying they would hold them responsible.  Voters tended to divide down Leave-Remain and party lines.  Leavers were equally split, with 36 per cent ready to put the blame for a no deal on Mrs May\u0026rsquos government, and 36 per cent blaming the EU.  While 41 per cent of Remainers would blame Mrs May and 17 per cent the EU.  Among Labour supporters, 51 per cent would blame Mrs May and 13 per cent the EU.  Meanwhile 41 per cent of Tories blamed the EU, and 26 per cent their party leader.  UK negotiators are currently trying to sell Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan for a soft Brexit on goods and agri-foods to EU leaders, but there has been little sign of movement from Brussels.

International Trade Secretary Liam Fox put the odds of a no deal as high as 60 per cent because of European \u0026ldquointransigence.  Left Foot Forward editor Josiah Mortimer said that instead of telling voters to prepare for a no deal, they should prepare \u0026ldquofor the hit they\u0026rsquoll take if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.

And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 2:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 2:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 2:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 2:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick.

That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday.

Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow.

This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 16 Aug 2018 2:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/KYLEAKIN-V-SLEAT-8.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

Historywas clearly being made.\nSomeyears later in 2004 as Sinn Féin\u0027s Northern Chairperson Iproposed we invite an ANC representative to Ireland as part of the Cúige’s Céad (centenary) celebrations.\nThe Cúigeleadership agreed.\nBy thenRonnie Kasrils was the South African Minister of Intelligence.\nSo Ichanced my arm and sent off a letter more in vain hope than any realexpectation.\nRemarkablyRonnie wrote back accepting our invitation to visit Ireland, and, would do soas a representative of Thabo Mbeki’s government.\nNeedlessto say we were delighted (and, the Cúige had just been saved a fortune of moneyin plane fares!)\nAtremendously successful programme of events was organised and Ronnie Kasrilshad a big impact everywhere he visited and spoke.\nHe andother South African comrades returned the following year to share the ANC’sexperience of transition in government as we launched the big debate within therepublican base on policing.\nVerymany comrades have vivid memories of Ronnie’s contribution to our internalpolitical discussions during this period.\nHe alsoattended and addressed Ard Fheiseanna with his then wife Eleanor and thenafter her untimely death in 2009 he wrote a brilliant book about her own rolein the liberation struggle entitled the ‘Unlikley Secret Agent’.\nHislatest book ‘A Simple Man’ is a compelling critique of current day SouthAfrica.\nRonniewas a senior figure in the collective leadership of the ANC MK, or Unkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) and the South African Communist Party, as well asa Deputy Minister of Defence, and later Minister of Intelligence in SouthAfrica.\nThe newbook provides an analysis of the ANC’s transition from resistance to powerwhich is essential reading for all political activists.\nJoeSlovo, the former MK Chief of Staff, said to Ronnie Kasrils towards the end of1994 that very few people had enjoyed the unique privilege of serving in aliberation struggle and then in government as they had.\nAs acommitted internationalist he has consistently stood in support of the peopleof Palestine, Cuba and freedom loving people across the world.\nHe hasmade an important contribution to the Basque peace process.\nAlongwith others in South Africa he has strongly supported the Irish peace process,and Sinn Féin’s work to achieve an agreed, united Ireland.\nDuringtwo speaking engagements in Belfast and Derry he kept the audiences enthralledwith his political analysis. They reciprocated with standing ovations.\nIn theGasyard centre in Derry’s Bogside he raised the roof with a funny story ofmeeting Ché Guevara in Dar-es-Salaam where he said therevolutionary icon gave a speech on armed struggle in Africa which was “bollocks”!!!\nWe helda very dignified wreath laying ceremony at Martin McGuinness’ grave, duringwhich Ronnie spoke very emotionally of Martin’s legacy, before giving amilitary salute as one freedom fighter to another.\n\nIn aseparate moment towards the end of his stay he said to me warmly: “You’ve gotthe right strategy you’ve got the right politics. The humanity of your peopleand their commitment is so tremendous.\nWe allneed to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadershipand determination.\nHeroworship is something altogether different. That’s the stuff of sycophancy andthe notion that the celebration of personality is the end itself.\nThephrase that “we stand on the shoulders of giants” refers to those who have gonebefore us, but left a legacy of inspiration and leadership by example.\nThisSunday the National Hunger Strike commemoration will take place inCastlewellan, County Down.\n\nTheIrish Hunger strikers are now among a pantheon of iconic Irish andinternational figures who symbolise the struggle for a better world alongsidethe leaders of 1916 Mary Ann McCracken Nelson Mandela Ché Guevaraand Ho Chi Minh.\nBertoltBrecht the socialist poet wrote:\n      “There are those who struggle for a day and that is good\n                There are those whostruggle for a year and that is better\n                And there are those who struggle for twenty tears and that is better still\n  Then there are thosewho struggle all their lives, and they are the ones we cannot do without”\nRonnieKasrils continues to politically campaign enthusiastically for a better worldeven while approaching the autumn of his life.\nThestruggle for Irish unity, independence, and an Ireland of equals has beenenriched by his friendship and solidarity.\nSinn Féin and other progressives inIreland are proud to call him our comrade and our friend.    \n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27434  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“The vibrant, colourful and loud message from today’s Belfast Pride parade is that the ‘north is next’ and Sinn Féin will continue to campaign to ensure that this becomes a reality.” - Megan Fearon MLA\nSinn Féin joined thousands of people on the streets of Belfast today for the annual Belfast Pride finale in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. \nThe parade – led by the Belfast Pride Festival and Mayor of Belfast Deirdre Hargey – started at Custom House Square, made its way past City Hall and through Belfast City Centre. \n\nColourful banners and floats from businesses, community organisations, political parties, emergency services and campaign groups such as Love Equality joined the procession. \nThere was a clear message from today’s parade, there is a demand for equality for the LGBTQ+ community twinned with mass opposition to the DUP’s denial of marriage equality. \n, Sinn Féin Equality spokesperson, Megan Fearon MLA said pride is a display of ‘unity and determination’ to achieve equality. \n“It’s really important that we are all together here today to fight for equality of opportunity under the law. \n“Equality for all our citizens, but especially for our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters.

And this has been going on at this address for over 60 years. It’s the boys at the minute but previous to that it was their daddy and before that their grandfather Ernie.

inspires local woman to take on berlin marathon","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman is taking on 26.2 miles at one of the world’s most famous marathons on September 16 to help raise money for the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects.

I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay. I have a sizeable investment in this street and I feel as a business owner I should have a say,” she concluded.\n  \nA Mid and East Antrim Council spokesperson said: “Plans are being considered to extend the public realm scheme on this street, however, these are at a very early stage. \n  \n“We will be liaising with traders over the coming weeks in relation to initial consultation on concept designs.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost.

This is the biggest thing I’ve ever had to look forward to and hopefully something that will genuinely change my life, for the better, forever. I’m particularly excited to become a DWU Tiger and play for the school soccer team - I think that’ll be cool and something so different to teams at home.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I decided to apply for Study USA because I’d heard that it was an amazing experience and I know without a doubt the programme will have a positive impact on my future -  It’ll make me look more attractive to employers showing I took the chance to go and grow as person both independently and communicatively.\n\n“Hopefully it will also broaden my own personal network which in itself is an intangible asset to any business employing me as they gain potential connections in America, should they be necessary.”\n\nThe British Council, which is the UK’s international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations, manages Study USA on behalf of the Department for the Economy. Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy.

In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic symbolism on papal vestments revealed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I was completely taken by it.\n\n“It’s a penal cross from the year 1763 and is carved from little bits of wood but it’s a much loved thing and has been held in so many hands.\n\n“It’s designed to tell the story of the passion and resurrection of Jesus.”\n\nHe also said that the liturgy team wanted to create vestments that would stand the test of time and be a gift of the Irish church for major celebrations in the future.\n\nThe papal mass will be celebrated in Phoenix Park at the edge of Dublin city centre on Sunday August 26 with half-a-million people expected to attend.\n\nCommunion will be distributed from some 4,000 Eucharist ciboria and around 200 chalices – with Celtic logos – during the mass.\n\nFr McNiece said they would be sold on to parishes around Ireland in the hope of “recouping some of the costs”.\n\nMeanwhile, Skoda Ireland has revealed it will be the official car partner to the World Meeting Of Families.\n\nWhen Pope Francis lands in Dublin on Saturday August 25, he will be transported to President Michael D Higgins’ residence, Aras an Uachtarain, in a Skoda Rapid.\n\nSkoda Ireland’s head of marketing and product, Raymond Leddy, said: “As part of the papal fleet, we are commemorating Pope John Paul II’s visit to Ireland, with vehicle registration 182-C-1979 and, of course, marking this year’s event with vehicle registration 182-C-2018.\n\n“182-D-9093 is the primary vehicle, which, when the digits 9093 are inverted, spells out the word Pope.\n\n“Each Skoda Rapid provided has been customised to requirements. Modified glass has been installed and each vehicle has been provided in a unique navy-blue colour as requested.\n\n“Small chrome flag poles have also been installed to the passenger-side fenders, which will display the Vatican flag.\n\n“Following the departure of His Holiness, Pope Francis’s Skoda Rapid, together with an additional car, will be provided to a charity to be nominated by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, in accordance with the wishes of Pope Francis.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"plan to rent student housing during pope visit to be investigated","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

building is not to be used for anything other than students.\n\n“This is in breach of its planning permission, which states that it cannot be used for any purpose other than as student accommodation.\n\n“Aparto have not applied for permission to change the use of the structure.\n\n“After repeated lectures about the urgent need for student housing in Dublin, now these private, unaffordable blocks are not even being used for that purpose.\n\n“The rooms are being rented for about 80 euro per night, but the weekend of the Pope’s visit this rises to an astounding 170 euro per night.\n\n“The majority of Dorset Point’s rooms are available to students for only 41 weeks a year.\n\n“This means Aparto – and their multi-billion euro backers Hines – are making over 2 million euro in just 11 weeks.\n\n“Private student housing does not benefit students – just mega rich developers.\n\n“Purpose-built student accommodation in Dublin is an excuse for developers and investors to make money off building with no obligations whatsoever to those in need of affordable, secure housing.”\n\n92 new families become homeless in June 2018 according to charity Focus Ireland, campaigners and charities blame the current homelessness crisis on lack of affordable social housing.\n\nThere were 9,874 people homeless in the week of June 18-24 2018 across Ireland.\n\nThe number of families becoming homeless has increased by 28% since June 2017.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"popes in ireland papal altar has ring of irish tradition about it","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n

Being from Galway we connected that to the Claddagh Ring. It\u0027s all about putting your arms around somebody. We started thinking about these different elements then we very quickly realised that the altar will be circular. \n\n\"Normally a lot of stages you see around the world are rectangle shapes.

For us the visual of this is really important.\"\n\nOlder people are being urged to consult their GPs before embarking on a lengthy trek to see Pope Francis in the Phoenix Park. \n\nHealth chiefs have warned that people will have to walk up to 14km by the time they attend Mass and work their way back to a public transport hub. \n\nChief emergency management officer Brendan Lawlor said people \"need to engage with their healthcare provider\". \"For people who feel they may not be able to do this, we\u0027ve moved on in 40 years. The television coverage of event is going to be absolutely massive and close-up,\" he said. \n\n\"You\u0027ll see every aspect of the event so people shouldn\u0027t lose out.\"\n\nMore than 1,000 medical providers will be working within the confines of the Phoenix Park on Sunday, August 26. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards.
