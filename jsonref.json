A total of 22 per cent were regular massgoers, while about 20 per cent had belief with practice and 46 per cent has belief with minimal practice. Some 13 per cent had no belief or practice.The research found that 72 per cent of parents had sent their child to their school of their choice, while 24 per cent their child to the only school available in the area. A total of 4 per cent said they did not get their first preference for the school of their choice.Mass-goersThose who sent their child to their school of choice were more likely to be mass-goers.For example, while 82 per cent of those who go to mass once a month secured their first-choice school, this fell to 59 per cent among parents who never to to mass.When it came to factors that influence school choice, factors such as location (83 per cent said it was important) , academic reputation (81 per cent) and discipline (75 per cent) are the most important.The next most important factor was being able to make the sacraments at school (57 per cent), following by being a co-education school (54 per cent) and extra-curricular sport (57 per cent). A smaller number proportion rated having a Catholic ethos as important (44 per cent) or having some element of religious practice (42 per cent).The poll also indicated there was majority support among parents (78 per cent) for the Catholic Church to have some role in continuing to shape and influence the ethos of schools. A total of 9 per cent of parents reported that the Church should have a “much more active role” and 33 per cent thought the Church should have “some role” in the ethos of their local school “equal to that of other community members, such as parents, principals and teachers”. The research was commissioned by the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, the Catholic Education Partnership, and the Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools.The Government has pledged to improve parental choice by meeting a target of delivering 400 multi-denominational primary schools by 2030.However, new figures show there are 164 multi-denominational schools compared with 2,750 Catholic primary schools.The Irish Human Rights Commission’s (IHREC) has asked the United Nations to directly ask the State to account for its “slow progress on the estment of patronage from Catholic schools”.It said there is a need for equity of access, parental choice and human rights principles to be respected in education policy."},{"url":null,"title":"not for the first time i wonder if this is how he speaks to his parents","story":"The Secret Teacher: ‘As a teacher my word has never been gospel, but students came closer to hanging on every one three decades ago than they do today.’ Illustration: iStock‘I wasn’t here,” Séamus barked back when I asked him for the homework due that day.Not for the first time I wondered if this is how he speaks to his parents. And if he expects to be able to speak to a future boss in this tone when asked for work due by a specific deadline.Even if we strive to empower today’s adolescents, even perhaps to treat them as equals, there is a hierarchical difference between a student and a teacher and it needs to be reflected in interactions between them.Artificial intelligence and technological advances threaten lots of aspects of the human labour force. Covid may have dramatically changed education and accelerated progress in many respects, but it has not given rise to anything which suggests that the human teacher is now an endangered species.What we facilitate has less and less to do with learning to learn or to work, and more and more to do with learning to live and interact with others.Human contact facilitates the growth and learning of young people in ways that simply cannot be replicated digitally or robotically. When young people use their devices to look something up, the very fact that this resource is so readily available conditions them away from memorising.The whole concept of the search button at one’s fingertips negates the need to remember. We teachers play an invaluable role as daily reminders of the need to maintain brain elasticity as well as digital agility.As a teacher my word has never been gospel, but students came a lot closer to hanging on every one three decades ago than they do today. From a knowledge perspective, students simply don’t need us as much as they used to. And so we human teachers must work at maintaining our indispensability. The less essential our store of knowledge becomes to the pupils, the more crucial it is to drive the human connection.Relationships with young people may have changed and evolved dramatically but everyone in Irish classrooms still remain fundamentally human.E-learning and self-directed learning are already fully viable options, but they are far from the norm in compulsory education. Schools remained closed for months during 2020 and learning content was both captured and delivered digitally in whole new ways. Youngsters are comfortable in the tech and digital worlds. Too comfortable, if the speed at which they reach for their phones is any indication.Where they are less comfortable is in the area of social behaviour. Some young people challenge me in ways that I know they see as empowered, the way Séamus did when I asked for his work. They forget (or perhaps they have never known!) that there is a level of politeness from which nobody gets an exemption.For me personally this is not about how young people “speak to adults”, even if for many grown-ups this is still very much a thing. If young people want and expect us to treat them as equals, this involves them ensuring that their brand of empowerment is more that of a fully fledged adult than of an embarrassing wannabe adult.Many of the most recent examples of this that I have encountered have been in the tone of voice used to address me. Defensive responses delivered in the absence of any trace of attack from me.Schools are making particular efforts to upload work now to accommodate those forcibly absent due to Covid. Given that we generally upload work for classes rather than iniduals there is a reasonable expectation on our part that absence from school (for any reason) does not amount to missing out on work or offer an opportunity to avoid submitting a task.Nonetheless, “I wasn’t here” remains the mantra, almost without exception delivered in a wary so “why are you even asking me” tone. Exchanges such as these are among the most exhausting things about teaching. What everyone outside the profession fails to realise is that Séamus is only one of the 250 students I teach each week. And that because I teach 11 different class groups across 32 periods weekly I cannot actually hope to remember off the top of my head who exactly was absent when. (And could the robot? I find myself wondering.)And so the real lesson on offer here for Séamus is how to conduct himself in such interactions. It is an invitation to look at the broader context and recognise that perhaps I’m asking in error and need to have that pointed out to me, politely. He may learn to avoid being defensive where there is no need to be, and in this case to recognise that the work has been made available and that my request for it is, in fact, perfectly reasonable.These lessons will serve him well when he has a paid role and a human boss – an inidual with reasonable expectations that their employees have the appropriate social and soft skills to function effectively in a human workplace community.We too easily reserve the opportunity to learn such things for CSPE, SPHE and, more recently, the overall umbrella of the Wellbeing hours in schools. To compartmentalise in that way is to dangerously underestimate our value as real-life, human teachers. We play a fundamental role in young people’s formative years at a time when the technological takeover advances rapidly. What we teachers do when we are at our best demonstrates the very limits of technology.And long may that last.Without us in their lives, what would Séamus and his mates be like when they join the workforce?"},{"url":null,"title":"corruption index state improved marginally in 2021","story":"The State‘s level of corruption improved marginally last year, placing it in joint 13th position in 2021 on the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). Photograph: David SleatorThe State’s level of corruption improved marginally last year, placing it in joint 13th position in 2021 on the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).The Republic’s score on the CPI improved from 72 to 74, in a ranking of 180 countries based on levels of corruption. Ireland’s score is based on the findings of eight separate surveys and studies, conducted by international think-tanks and political risk agencies.The more a country receives out of 100, the less it is perceived to be affected by public-sector corruption.Ireland was on the same level as countries including Canada, Iceland, Estonia and Austria in 2021.The best performing countries according to the index were Denmark, followed by Finland and New Zealand, all with a joint score of 88, while the worst performing countries were South Sudan (11), followed by Syria (13) and Somalia (13).Chief executive of Transparency International, John Devitt, said that while Ireland performed relatively well in comparison to most countries on the CPI, that was “no indicator of actual levels of corruption here”.“The risk of corruption is still underestimated in local government, companies and state bodies and our last public survey, the Global Corruption Barometer, showed that a large proportion of the public think corruption is a problem,” he said.If the Government is to restore public confidence in its ability to stop abuse or misuse of power, Mr Devitt said, “it needs to accelerate efforts to promote transparency and accountability in public office”.IndexSpeaking at a webinar to promote the annual index, Mr Devitt said the State needed to be “far more proactive in sharing information about public contracts” and proposed the creation of an independent Anti-Corruption Bureau that would be dedicated to investigating political corruption.Transparency International Ireland called for the restoration of the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015, which lapsed at the last election.“The Bill would have implemented reforms proposed by the Mahon Tribunal in 2012 and required TDs and officer holders to disclose additional financial interests including large loans and liabilities. It would also have reformed the Standards in Public Office Commission,” Mr Devitt said.In addition, Transparency International Ireland has recently called for the implementation of a long-term open government strategy and to reform the Electoral Act to remove restrictions on funding for human rights groups and campaigning charities as part of its forthcoming open government partnership national action plan.The Government “can’t afford to delay long-overdue reforms any further”, said Mr Devitt.‘Reform’“There needs to be more ambition from Ireland to push reform forward if we would like to be among our counterparts in Europe, ” Catherine Lawlor, advocacy and research coordinator at Transparency International Ireland said.Corruption at a global level was “the single biggest barrier to addressing the world’s most intractable problems, including climate breakdown”, he said.Professor Robert Gillanders of the DCU Anti-Corruption Research Centre (ARC) said that “if people are seen to be acting with impunity, there is no surer way to undermine your democracy. We see that all around the world. Where you have higher perceptions of corruption, people trust the state less,” he said.This led to people “not taking the covid vaccine, not paying their taxes… Impunity is poison to a countr”, Mr Gillanders said.Countries at the top of the index must not let their institutions decay, corruption measurement expert Dr Roberto Kukutschka said.“If you’re at the top of the index, stay on top of this and continue to strengthen your institutions and work on anti-corruption. Even if you believe it is not happening anymore. It is very important to avoid institutional decay and democratic backslide,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"employers to have at least 13 grounds to refuse remote working requests","story":"Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar launches details of new law giving workers the right to request remote working at Dublin Castle on Tuesday afternoon. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Photos Employers will be able to refuse to grant an employee’s right to work remotely on at least 13 different grounds under draft legislation published on Tuesday. However, they will have to be able to justify the decision if it is appealed by the worker. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar unveiled plans to give workers the right to request remote working after draft legislation was approved by Cabinet. He said that up until now remote and home working had been imposed on people due to public health restrictions imposed during the pandemic. “Now that they have been lifted, I want it to be a choice. I want workers to be able to work from home or remotely or hybrid if they want to.” Employers will have to respond to a worker’s request for remote working within three months. If they decline the request they will have to offer “reasonable business grounds for doing so” which under the legislation may include, but are not limited to, 13 different reasons. They include that the nature of the work does not allow for the work to be done remotely that the work cannot be reorganised among existing staff and it would have a potential negative impact on either work quality or performance. Planned structural changes, the burden of additional costs and concern for the protection of business confidentiality or intellectual property are other grounds listed. Concerns over the suitability of the proposed workspace on health and safety grounds or on data protection grounds are also cited as grounds. Employers can also refuse to grant remote working if there are concerns about internet connectivity of the proposed remote working location or there is and inordinate distance between the proposed remote location and on-site location. They can also refuse if the proposed remote working arrangement conflicts with the provisions of an applicable collective agreement. And the request can be refused if there is an ongoing or recently concluded formal disciplinary processes. Under the legislation appeals can be brought internally or to the Workplace Relations Commission or both. Opposition politicians have claimed that the Government proposals do not go far enough and have called for people to be given the right to remote working. Mr Varadkar said an “absolute right” to remote working is “not practical” saying there are a lot of jobs that can’t be done remotely. “Construction, hospitality, care, most of retail, the transport sector, it just wouldn’t be possible to do those jobs from home. “I think most people will understand that.” He said: “In other cases, it might be possible to do job from home or remotely but that would result either in very high costs being burdened on the employer or potentially a diminution in services.” He gave the example of college lecturers or teachers who could provide lectures or lessons online, but added: “that would result in a diminution of service for students.” Mr Varadkar said that what is planned is a “qualified right, but one that I think makes sense and is practical and achievable”. Workers become eligible to apply for remote working once they have been in a job for six months. Employers will have to respond to a worker’s request working within 12 weeks. The employer can say yes make a counter offer with the worker getting a month to consider this or refuse, though if they do this the employer must offer a good reason. Mr Varadkar said that reason will “have to stack up and be solid” and this will be made clear in the final legislation when it is published. Mr Varadkar also said: “We’d intend to have this legislated before the summer recess and certainly in place this year.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside number 10 defectors club","story":"There are two words to describe what it feels like to cross the floor of the House of Commons according to defector Shaun Woodward: “Relief – and that it’s ghastly.”A little over two decades before Bury South MP Christian Wakeford jumped ship from the Conservative Party to Labour last week, Mr Woodward made the same journey, a process he found both more painful than he could have imagined and, in hindsight, always inevitable. Woodward quit after the Tory leadership under William (now Lord) Hague opposed plans to repeal Section 28, the rule prohibiting the “promotion” of homosexuality in public arenas including schools. Wakeford, a 37-year-old former insurance broker, who was elected as Conservative MP for Derby South in 2019, made his dramatic departure declaring Boris Johnson and his party incapable of providing leadership in the wake of the furore over parties at No 10.Whatever the motivation, nearly all those in the small defectors’ club of MPs say they have no regrets about breaking the ultimate political taboo.Westminster might love the drama of an MP crossing the floor, but what is the human impact on the “traitors” who abandon their tribe – and on the morale of those left behind? Can they ever find a home among politicians and activists who once saw them as the enemy, or are they always viewed with suspicion? Wakeford himself has said the decision to abandon Johnson’s party for that of Sir Keir Starmer was the most difficult of his life. Clearly shaken by the experience, he admitted to sleepless nights and stumbled over his new leader’s name in his first public event as a Labour MP, momentarily giving the impression he was now serving “Keir Llama”. For Woodward too, the decision was a traumatic one – “seismic,” he says - with his departure accelerated, as, allegedly, with Wakeford, by the Whips’ Office attempting to blackmail him into toeing the line.  “I just thought – this is horrible this is not why I came into politics. So I reached out to friends in the Labour Party and said: ‘I don’t think I am going to stay in the Conservative Party.’”“I am very conscious of the people I hurt. But I didn’t go because I would be well received, I went because I couldn’t possibly stay.”Baroness Nicholson, who as Emma Nicholson crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats in 1995, agrees: “I suddenly flipped,” she told Radio 4’s Today programme this week. “I was getting sick and tired of John Major’s vacillation on the European issue. I could suddenly take it no longer.“The worst thing about changing political parties is that you hurt people, and you hurt people who you love dearly, admire, respected, even fought with, but you hurt them very much indeed, and to live with that hurt is really, really difficult.”Like Woodward, who was dismayed by what he saw as the abandonment by Hague of One Nation Toryism, former Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger considers that her party left her, rather than the other way round. In 2019 she co-founded The Independent Group in response to what she viewed as a failure to act against anti-Semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership this later became a new political party, Change UK, before Berger eventually joined the Liberal Democrats.“It was horrific to leave my political home of 20 years,” she reflects, “but in my mind it didn’t in any way represent the values that led me to it in the first place, so I could no longer be a part of it.“I absolutely made the right decision and I don’t have any regrets and I would do it again.” Jumping ship used to be a far more common affair – Winston Churchill decamped from the Conservatives to the Liberal Party in 1904, not returning to the fold for two decades. But even then “ratting” was a high stakes game. When a group of Labour MPs resigned the whip to join Oswald Mosley’s fascist New Party in 1931, two quit after a day to become independents.In recent years, defecting has proven something of a kamikaze mission of the 23 MPs who crossed the floor in the last 30 years, all but four lost their seats at the next election, Berger among them. Of the four who survived, two – including Woodward – had been offered safer seats than those they had won under a different party’s banner.The only two to have triumphed again at the ballot box are Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who quit the Conservatives for the UK Independent Party in 2014 crucially, both took the decision to resign as MPs and stand again in a by-election (Reckless, however, lost at the next general election).Carswell says the decision to fight a by-election was partly tactical, to put maximum pressure on then-prime minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on the question of Britain’s membership of the European Union, but also a matter of principle. Carswell’s defection was greeted relatively positively by both the voters and his party activists in his constituency of Clacton, with many in his local association following him to Ukip. To his surprise, most of his former Conservative colleagues in Parliament also remained on friendly terms.“I think they had respect for the fact that I had submitted myself to a by-election,” he says. “Had I not done that, they would have seen it as a case of getting elected under their colours then abandoning them.”That’s not to say that Carswell didn’t find the process emotional.“Anyone who is leaving one party for another is going to find difficulties. The only way to neutralise that is to resign and call a by-election.”Woodward, however, disagrees. “If you think that every time somebody crosses the floor there should be a by-election then Parliament should change the law. It shouldn’t be a reaction to one inidual’s actions. At the moment we still put the name of the candidate on the ballot paper – not the party.”Saying that, Woodward admits he felt far more comfortable in the Labour Party once he fought a general election in his new seat of St Helens. This, he says, helped him to get away from the disapproval of his former activists in his former constituency of true blue Whitney.Of Wakeford he says: “Actually, I think if he stood for a by-election, he’d probably win.” Additional reporting by Eleanor Steafel Rosa Prince is editor of The House magazineMore from NewsUkraine crisis latest: Britain will send troops to protect allies in Eastern Europe if Russia invades, Boris Johnson warnsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson welcomes Met investigation into No 10 parties as opportunity to \u0026#39draw line\u0026#39 under debacleBoris may have been given a temporary reprieve.

Twenty-one of these were found to have a causal link, where a BMI of at least 30 is a direct trigger of the disease.Twelve of the 21 - including coronary artery disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes - were more specifically linked to these lucky genes which determine how and where the fat is stored.The other nine conditions were linked to obesity, but not the lucky genes. Instead, they are simply caused by a person weighing too much and putting added strain on their body. Deep vein thrombosis and arthritic knees are examples of this.But the researchers warn that even if a person is, by pure chance, in possession of these fortuitous genes, they would be in better health and less at risk of chronic disease if they were not obese.Dr Yaghootkar said: “To better prevent and measure risk of disease, it is important to understand if obesity is a causal risk factor and, if it is causal, which consequences of it – be they metabolic, mechanical or psychological – are deriving the risk.“Our results also provide evidence that everyone will benefit from losing their extra fat even if they are metabolically healthy.”More from NewsUkraine crisis latest: Britain will send troops to protect allies in Eastern Europe if Russia invades, Boris Johnson warnsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson welcomes Met investigation into No 10 parties as opportunity to \u0026#39draw line\u0026#39 under debacleBoris may have been given a temporary reprieve.

Dominic Raab, the Deputy Prime Minister, said: “I would much rather we didn’t have to do it but given the pandemic and the walloping of the public finances, we do.” The Prime Minister had “grasped the nettle”.Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, had a similar message. The £12 billion in revenues were essential to fund the NHS and then an overhaul of social care. It was a “big decision” that the Prime Minister had got right, he said.Except that Boris Johnson does not appear to share the commitment of his Cabinet colleagues to this policy. Asked yesterday to guarantee that the tax rise would proceed, he declined to do so. It is emblematic of the incoherence at the top of the Government that senior ministers are being sent out to argue for a policy that seems to be in a state of flux. One reason why Mr Johnson is losing support among his colleagues is because so many have been dispatched by No 10 to defend an approach that has later been jettisoned, occasionally on the same day.If the tax rise is being reconsidered then that is welcome. The revenues are to be spent on an unreformed NHS and it is fanciful to believe they will seamlessly be switched to social care in three years’ time. Opposition to the increase is growing on the backbenches, though it should be noted that only five Tories voted against it when it was put to the Commons in September.

Luck, of course, is a vital element in any politician’s career, but given events since Starmer took over the reins of his party from his predecessor in April 2020, you would be hard pressed to argue that he enjoyed anything other than the bad sort.After a positive start, when voters were simply relieved they no longer had to live with the incessant soap opera of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Labour’s poll ratings started to slide again, as voters got to know Starmer and decided, on the whole, that they weren’t particularly impressed with him. Last year’s local elections, which coincided with the Hartlepool by-election, was a nadir for him and his party. Starmer’s subsequent performance during the pandemic didn’t help much: the public seemed content to stick with the devil they knew rather than take a chance with the new boy on the block.In the last couple of months everything has changed, mostly for reasons that are nothing to do with Starmer or his front bench’s valiant efforts. Labour’s poll lead, however long it lasts, is wholly down to unforced errors by Johnson and his team. But who cares about that? Certainly not the shadow cabinet, who will accept the fruits of victory however they were won.It may be significant that Johnson’s troubles have largely been caused by his apparent disrespect for anti-Covid rules, including his irresistible urge to attend parties (or work events, depending on the terms of Sue Gray’s final report), and Johnson’s ill-fated attempt to rewrite the rules on House of Commons standards to protect former parliamentary colleague Owen Paterson from censure.Because even before this winter of discontent for the Conservatives, there were siren voices warning that the Johnson government was already straying too far from any known understanding of the word “conservative”. The pandemic changed the political and economic discourse measures such as furlough and a range of business support initiatives, including unexpected billions in public support for the railway and bus companies to see them through a period of historically low passenger numbers, transformed the traditional economic arguments that usually define our politics.It\u0027s certainly true that Labour has been unable, even in these times of staggering levels of public spending, to resist its instinct to demand even more cash from the Treasury. But by the time of the next election, the reliable tactic of pointing the finger at their spendthrift opponents will simply no longer seem a credible tactic for the Conservative Party. Covid has changed much in society but its impact on the political arena goes far beyond arguments over the length of lockdowns or the effectiveness of mask mandates.How does a “small state” party (in name and reputation, at least, if not in practice) resurrect the successful tactic employed in past elections of putting their opponents on the defensive over their spending plans when they themselves have just presided over the largest short-term increase in public spending since World War II?It’s when such questions are asked that you begin to see the tactical wisdom of Labour’s enthusiastic support for multiple lockdowns. Their primary concern, as with the government, was public safety. But for Labour, watching from the side lines as the government borrowed on the never-never and wielded the power of the state to control and direct everyone’s lives, the last two years was as much a confirmation of their political philosophy as it was a repudiation of the Conservatives’. Supporting restrictions was, in essence, a win-win.Unexpectedly, at least for the Right-wing of the Conservative Party, it was not Rishi Sunak’s over-stretched credit card that started to push his party’s fortunes lower in the polls but the personal foibles and judgment of the prime minister. The public seem quite content with a high-spending, high-tax party of government, so long as its leader isn’t seen to be flouting rules on personal behaviour that he himself set.It\u0027s difficult to see how that can be good news for the Conservative Party, or at least for a Conservative Party that claims it wants to recapture the low tax, small government agenda. Labour, on the other hand, would be only too happy to continue what Johnson and Sunak have begun, and they would at least do it enthusiastically and deliberately, rather than with an apologetic wince every time a few billion was committed or a few per cent added to our tax bills.It may be hard to believe, but one day the daily revelations about parties at Number 10 during lockdown will cease and the media caravan will move on. At some point, the forces on both sides of the political ide will have to reassemble on the battlefield and decide what they’re actually fighting about. On public spending, the game has already been partly won by Labour. If there is no counter-attack, a new post-Thatcherite consensus will emerge that will be difficult to challenge. And the only casualty will be the Conservative Party.More from NewsUkraine crisis latest: Britain will send troops to protect allies in Eastern Europe if Russia invades, Boris Johnson warnsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson welcomes Met investigation into No 10 parties as opportunity to \u0026#39draw line\u0026#39 under debacleBoris may have been given a temporary reprieve.

The police have been under mounting pressure to launch an investigation into the claims - with the Mirror first reporting allegations of rule-breaking gatherings back in November. Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray had been expected to publish the results of her inquiry into the apospartygateapos saga this week - with Boris Johnsonaposs future hanging in the balance. But the Mirror understands that the report will not be published in full until the Met Police finish their investigation. Downing Street said Ms Gray will halt her work on any party allegations being looked at by the police. But she is free to publish findings on other parts of her inquiry that police are not considering, No  suggested  The PMaposs official spokesman said: As the terms of reference make clear, they wonapost publish anything that relates to the work of the police, there are a number of events and allegations that they have looked into that the police said donapost reach their threshold, which they are able to continue looking into. And it is my understanding that they will be able to publish detail about those events rather than ones which the police might be taking forward. He added: Itaposs up to the investigation team when they publish, itaposs my understanding they are able to publish the aspects that arenapost a matter for the police. The spokesman was unsure whether the Gray inquiry wouldto other events once the police investigation concludes. It is unclear how long it will take the police to carry out their investigation. Dame Cressida declined to say how many events were being looked at, only that the police had several in their sights. The fact that we are now investigating does not, of course, mean that fixed penalty notices will necessarily be issued in every instance and to every person involved, she said. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: The investigation being carried out by Sue Gray is continuing. There is ongoing contact with the politan Police Service. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner questioned how Mr Johnson can remain Prime Minister while No  is subject to a police investigation. Boris Johnson is a national distraction, she said.Conservative MPs should stop propping him up and he should finally do the decent thing and resign. Families who lost loved ones during the pandemic said the report was a shameless attempt to save face - and called on the PM to resign. Matt Fowler, co-founder of Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: Every day Boris Johnson remains in office is a disaster for the country’s pandemic response, that unnecessarily puts more lives at risk.Nobody outside of Westminster thinks we need to wait for Sue Grayaposs report. The Prime Minister has already lost all credibility and the fact that the leader of the country is now under police investigation is deeply reprehensible . He needs to resign.The Sue Gray “inquiry” is clearly a shameless attempt to save face. The only inquiry with any credibility is the independent one led by Baroness Hallet, which is about learning lessons that will save lives, and give those of us that have lost loved ones the answers we deserve.

The terrible tales we tell today of people struggling to make ends meet are before April’s rocketing fuel bills start accelerate beyond recent rises, tightening the financial screw on people already struggling to stretch incomes to cover higher living costs. The year of the squeeze, , will force more folk to choose between eating and heating as poverty kills men and women in one of the earth’s richest countries. It doesn’t have to be this way. It’s a choice by the Conservative Government. And it’s a scandal that must be challenged, forcing the Tories into another U-turn – this time suspending VAT on energy bills, giving extra help to low earners and cancelling a hefty National Insurance tax rise.  Dignied, heroic Jack Mortimer and the others deserve our support. Out the bigots The sickening bigotry, prejudice and racism within the Conservative Party exposed by MP and sacked Minister Nusrat Ghani’s explosive claim her Muslim religion was why she was sacked from Boris Johnson’s Government is utterly repellent. Deep nauseating schisms exposed in the Tories by the unacceptable discrimination, Health and Education Secretaries Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi speaking in support of Ghani while Downing Street and loyal backbencher Michael Fabricant add insults to injury, mustn’t be ignored.  This ugly scandal cannot be dealt with by the Conservative Party or Parliament. The Equality and Human Rights Commission must launch a formal inquiry into evidence that bigotry against Muslims is unlawfully polluting the governing party.

Ex-health minister Steve Brine made £-an-hour giving aposstrategic adviceapos to drug firm Sigma without first checking with the Advisory Body on Business Appointments .And last February, Mr Brine arranged a meeting between Sigma and then-Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Two months later, the firm was awarded a £, government contract to supply Covid- tests to pharmacies.Mr Brine claimed to have consulted revolving door watchdog about all of his outside jobs.  But an investigation by the Sunday Mirror discovered he had not consulted them over a £, role giving strategic advice to Sigma pharmaceuticals until after he took the job - an apparent breach of the ministerial code. But both the firm and Mr Brine deny he acted as a lobbyist, and insist he played no role in the deal. But ACOBA chair Lord Pickles, said there was a reasonable concern that his contact with Mr Zahawi was only made available to Sigma as a direct result of Mr Brineaposs time as a minister at the Department for Health and Social Care  He added: I do not consider it was in-keeping with the letter or the spirit of the governmentaposs rules for former ministers for a former minister at DHSC to contact a minister with responsibilities for health on behalf of a pharmaceutical company which pays him.Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: From the revolving door to crony contracts, the scandals just keep mounting for a Conservative Party mired in sleaze from the Prime Minister down. Even the governmentaposs in house committee is increasingly concerned about the behaviour of former Tory ministers and has called on them to act.Labour will ban ministers for at least five years after they leave office and create a genuinely independent watchdog to enforce the rules, ending the days that Tory politicians could profit from privileged access, information and taxpayersapos money. Enough is enough.In a letter to Cabinet Office minister Steve Brine about the case, Lord Pickles added: I am growing increasingly concerned that not all former Ministers of the Crown are sufficiently clear on the ious standards of behaviour, rules and legislation that are incumbent on them. He added: It is now a matter for you to decide what appropriate action to take. Acoba has no power to impose punishments on ministers or former ministers who break the rules. Former Ministers have to consult ACOBA before taking any job within two years of leaving government. The Sunday Mirror revealed last month that Mr Brine had only contacted the body after he had started working for Sigma. The Ministerial Code states: “Former Ministers must ensure that no new appointments are announced, or taken up, before the Committee has been able to provide its advice.” And ACOBA’s guidance for former ministers states: “A retrospective application is one where an appointment or employment has been taken up or announced before the Committee has provided its full and final advice. “This is a breach of the government’s Rules.” There’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of Sigma. Lord Pickles handed Mr Brineaposs case to the Cabinet Office to decide what -any - punishment he should receive. In a letter to Lord Pickles, Mr Brine said his failure to consult ACOBA before starting the job was an error and apologised for poor admin on my part. He admitted personally arranging for Mr Zahawi to attend the meeting with Sigma, but denied he was using his contacts to influence Government policy or secure business for the firm. Mr Brine quietly quit the job with Sigma in November, after the Prime Minister vowed to ban MPs from exploiting their positions with consultancy jobs. He has since resigned from two further consultancy jobs - each worth £, a year.

But after being assured it was probably nothing to worry about, the -year-old mum thought nothing further of it.She headed back home with her husband Bill, , and kids Phoebe, , Florence, eight and Albert, five and waited for her next scan. But at  weeks, she started to worry. “It was a % size dference, which is when it becomes a concern,” Kelly told The Mirror. Knowing one of her babies was signicantly smaller than the other, Kelly said she did everything she could to get her smaller baby to grow - including eating protein and drinking as much water as possible.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters hereBut as her pregnancy progressed, little Chester still wasn’t growing as much as his twin brother Otis.“Week in, week out, we were told that Chester wouldn’t survive. We were told to be prepared,” Kelly recalled. “I just tried to stay positive. I kept thinking to myself, ‘he’s going to be fine as long as we keep tracking him’. But he was only ever growing g a week.” Then at  weeks, Kelly’s waters broke and, after going to Southend Hospital, she was rushed to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge. She recalled: “I’d planned to deliver at  weeks because it was safer, but once I got to Addenbrooke, we realised Chester’s heart rate was declining.  “They gave me the talk about whether or not I wanted to have the C section then, which could potentially put Otis at risk. “My maternal instinct kicked in. I had to give Chester a chance.” After a dicey delivery, the boys were born on  July  - but arriving  weeks early, they were tiny. While Otis weighed lb oz, Chester was a minuscule lb oz, and his le was hanging in the balance. “Otis was as fine as you can be for being delivered that early,” Kelly said, explaining he was incubated and put on a CPAP machine to help with his breathing.  Chester, however, needed much more help getting oxygen into his body and was put on a ventilator. “We were told ventilation was successful and it was a case of wait and see. The first week is a bit of a ‘honeymoon period’ for premature babies and they can often seem like they’re doing amazing,” Kelly said. Kelly and Bill had a nail-biting wait in hospital for the first weeks of their sons’ lives - but after Otis improved and was transferred to Southend Hospital, they had to juggle visiting both boys. “If I’m honest, that first month of their lives I was on autopilot,” Kelly recalled. “We were staying in a charity hotel and just going through the motions. “I don’t know how we coped with that drive from Addenbrooke back home. We had to see Chester, then see Otis for an hour, and then go back home to see the other kids.  “All this was happening while Chester wasn’t very stable. My sisters and our parents were filling in with childcare where they could.” Kelly added Bill had to do all the driving while she was recovering from her c-section, putting even more strain on the family. Finally,  days after the twins were born, the family received some good news when Otis was allowed to come home from the hospital. “It was so nice to bring him home to meet the children as they weren’t allowed to visit him in the hospital due to Covid,” Kelly said, adding she thought Chester “wouldn’t be far behind.” She said: “I thought it might just be another month, at most up until their due date in October.” But as the days passed, Chester was still fighting for his le in NICU - battling necrotising enterocolitis , which can kill premature babies, and sepsis.To make matters worse for the parents, little Otis began to show signs of being unwell too. “I thought he had just colic, but then he started to get a nappy rash and it just wouldn’t clear up. “We took him to hospital and he was in for  days with what looked like an ear infection,” Kelly said. The parents had another agonising wait to find out what was wrong with Otis, before learning he had a rare zinc deficiency. Luckily, after being given zinc supplements, Otis recovered well. But all the while, Chester was still in the hospital.  “We never thought it would go on this long,” Kelly said, adding she was sure Chester would be home with the family for Christmas. I just wanted the day to be over with. We made it special for the kids but while we were decorating the tree, it felt like something was missing, she added. While Kelly and Bill have to juggle being at the hospital with Chester and looking after the other kids, they’ve both been out of work - putting enormous financial and emotional strain on the family.A friend of the family has set up a GoFundMe page to help them through this dficult time.“Up until this point we’ve been ok and making it work with savings. Bill can’tto work because Otis isn’t allowed in the hospital when we’re visiting Chester,” she explained. As for Chester, who now weighs lbs, his rollercoaster start to le has thrown the family in all dferent directions - and he’s recently been put back on ventilation due to unstable oxygen levels in his blood. “His heart has had to be working extra hard to pump blood, so now his heart is enlarged,” Kelly said.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc“It came as a shock. He was doing really well and his oxygen had gone up, but he became really poorly on New Year’s Eve.” Currently living at Addenbrooke Hospital with Chester, Kelly is hopeful her family will be reunited soon. “Chester has done amazingly well with his growth, and there are positives to take from this.

David Thompson and Jessica Morris, who both suffer from mental health conditions, are unable to work - and have no money to rent a property, YorkshireLive report.The pair have now been forced to spend the freezing winter months in a dirty tent in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, with no access to warm water. They spend their days with dogs, Blaze and Marcel, in the cramped tent in the Valley View campsite. The couple say Kirklees Council have left them living in terrible conditions after going back on their promise. We told the council we would be moving up and they told us they would help us find suitable accommodation, said David, , who lives with ADHD and depression. They have since told us there is nowhere suitable for us because we have got the dogs. It makes so many things harder - we donapost have a fridge, so we canapost keep our food or things like milk for longer than two days. We are dealing with rain coming into the tent because itaposs all ripped and we also have mould. Itaposs not good for us but we canapost do anything  really.

The -year-old added the couple are hoping to attend a house viewing set up by the council on February . A Kirklees Council spokesperson told : “Tackling rough sleeping is one of the Council’s key priorities. We have a rough sleeping team dedicated to working with those in urgent need of help, including offering temporary accommodation where appropriate, but this offer is not always taken-up for ious reasons.“It is not always possible to house dogs in temporary accommodation, but we always work to find temporary foster care for pets whilst their owners await permanent re-housing.“In this case, both services were offered whilst the couple were being matched to a suitable property.“A long-term home has now been found and, once the property has undergone repairs, will be ready for them to view.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON David ThompsonCare homesMental healthNursing homesAnimalsADHDTown Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"delivery driver sacked after berating","story":"Delivery driver sacked after berating mum who ordered pizza then fell asleepThe driver left the woman an angry voicemail and called her a b*****d after she ordered the takeaway but then failed to answer the door and pay in Sunderlandthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video sunderland-delivery-driver-leaves-angry-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:LWzEhi,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Emily Ross ordered a -inch barbecue chicken pizza and a kebab from Pasha Pizza in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, while walking home from a night out on Saturday. The -year-old said she intended to pay by cash but instead fell asleep at the top of the stairs before the pizza arrived at around .am and did not hear the driver knocking. The following morning, Emily claims she picked up her phone to call the takeaway and offer to pay but instead found the angry -second voicemail berating her for not answering the door. Pasha Pizza confirmed one of their drivers had left the potty-mouthed voicemail and has since been sacked. Emily said: I was passed out at the top of the stairs and I didnapost hear him knock or my phone ring. I donapost even remember calling and making the order. I donapost know how I even got a sentence out. I was devastated when I realised Iaposd missed him. I was starving. Emily, from Sunderland, said she found the incident funny and admitted she opted not to pay once she discovered the expletive-laden rant. She added: When I got up and listened to the voicemail, I just thought aposwhat on earth apos I was laughing. Luckily I found it funny and it didnapost bother me. Iaposve never heard anything like it before. I was going to ring up and pay because I would never normally do that, it must be awful when people donapost pay. If I ran a takeaway, Iaposd be frustratedthat happened because I bet they lose a lot of money. But I thought that surely I couldnapost then ring up and say Iaposve called to pay but Iaposve received that voicemail. The potty-mouthed driver left a voicemail saying this is Pasha Pizza. Youaposre not answering your f*g motherf*g phone. Do not call my shop any more b*d stupid f****r. Luckily, the stay-at-home mum of one saw the funny side of the shocking rant and posted the recording on social media where itaposs racked up , shares. Emily said: Iaposve never ordered from there before and Iaposd been looking forward to it. I normally pay by bank card but I was going to pay in cash which is probably why he was raging. It must be awful when people order and donapost answer the phone. Pasha Pizza confirmed the business is aware of the presence of the voicemail online.A spokesperson said: Unfortunately this was our driver and he has since been fired. This is not how we would operate no matter the circumstances. The lady in question called the shop at .am on January , ,  minutes after closing hours and begged us to take her order. We kindly agreed and kept five of our staff members working after they were ready to go home, we switched the equipment back on and made her order. However, when our driver arrived at her home there were people inside the home and he could hear them clearly laughing. He kept knocking but no one answered the door. He then came back to the store and was instructed to call the customer again just in case they had given the wrong address, again there was no answer. This went on with the shop trying to contact her until :am. The driver then lost his temper and unfortunately left an angry voicemail. The restaurant also explained that since the foul-mouthed rant went viral, it has been inundated with abuse from people who saw the clip online. The spokesperson said: Since this incident we have been subjected to over  harassment calls to the shop. We have also had people voicing that they know where the owner lives and even had one person send messages and make threats that he was going to come to the owneraposs home and even stated the name of the owneraposs next-door neighbour. Due to all of this we have had to contact the police who are now dealing with this situation due to the harassment and threats being made.

It was during the Nineties and he was a governor at a nearby school. We arranged to meet to discuss a story. My paper didn’t have picture bylines at the time but I knew who he was. We arranged to meet at a town hall but as I approached him a look of horror swept over his face. I stuck out a hand to introduce myself.“Hi, I’m Darren, good to meet you.” I said. “Oh,” he replied. “You don’t sound black on the phone ”The meeting didn’t last long.  I remembered it while listening to the preposterous Tory MP Michael Fabricant over the weekend. He was speaking after ex-minister Nusrat Ghani claimed she was told by party Whips that she was sacked in  because her ‘Muslimness’ made colleagues uncomfortable. Chief Whip Mark Spencer has rejected the claim as “completely ” and “defamatory”. Fabricant took to radio station LBC, saying: “I think the whole thing actually stinks. She’s hardly someone who is obviously a Muslim.”  Where to start  To dismiss blond wig-on-a-stick Fabricant as a ludicrous character Harry Enfield or Ricky Gervais would have been proud of actually allows the Lichfield MP off the hook. You can make up your own mind as to the legitimacy of Ms Ghani’s claim. It wouldn’t surprise anyone, however, that it has erupted within a party whose leader compared Muslim women to letterboxes and bank robbers. Or that Downing Street has confirmed Ms Ghani complained to Prime Minister Boris Johnson directly – two years ago.  Johnson, she claimed, urged the former junior minister to use the formal complaint process which, with this regime, is probably a bit like going to the policeyou have an issue with a colleague within the mafia. Don’t be fooled into thinking the inquiry called by Johnson on Monday morning is anything other than a welcome opportunity to keep the upcoming Partygate report from Sue Grayoff the front pages. If Johnson really does take the issue seriously, why didn’t he bang his fist on his desk and order the inquiry back then, when Ms Ghani told him  In any case the inquiry won’t be independent - even though civil servants are supposed to be. It will be conducted by the Cabinet Office – the people who work for the PM. Don’t be surprised when it turns up a nothing-to-see-here whitewash. The stag do that has been Johnson’s premiershiphas shown us a party stuck in the past. A nationalistic, flag-waving regime, replete with Benny Hill-type chancers pining for the days of the Empire and a time when you could say anything you wanted, regardless of any offence caused.

Bray, from Sevenoaks, Kent, went on to lose a whopping £, betting mostly online on horse races, dogs, tennis, darts and basketball. The football fan says the day his le totally turned around was when he fronted up and asked for help. When I went to university, I had more money and time on my hands, he recalled. I would miss lectures, and I wasnapost even socialising that much. I was sporty as a child too but at university, gambling took over my le. His lowest point was when he lost his entire student loan in just a single day. In the January term I got my student loan of £, and within  hours I had bet it all away, said Bray.  I didnapost come out my room for two days, I couldnapost talk, it was just awful. That was the one where I knew was something seriously wrong. After a night out with friends instead of going home, Bray would hit the casino in search of a winning thrill.

One of the biggest things that Iaposm passionate about is there needs to be more money donated for treating gambling addicts and their family. The companies are making profits but theyaposre not giving back enough to the problem they cause. Bray says bookmaker firms only want losers and will restrict accounts owned by those lucky enough to win money. That really highlights theyaposre not interested in playing fairly, the business model is based on people who continually lose, he said. Some of the advertising needs to be reined in also.

Hereaposs everything you need to know on Burns Night , including the story of Burnsapos le, his most famous poems, and how Burns Night is traditionally celebrated around the UK. Who was Robert Burns A poet and lyricist, Robert Burns was born in Ayrshire, Scotland in . He was the eldest of seven children, and grew up in poverty on his familyaposs farm.While much of his childhood was spent doing manual labour, Burnsapos parents made sure that he received an education. He grew up reading the works of great writers, and was known for carrying a book wherever he went.His first attempt at poetry came when he was -years-old, and in love with a farm labourer called Nelly Kilpatrick. Burns wrote her O, Once I Lovaposd A Bonnie Lass . He grew up to be quite the womaniser, fathering his first child in  after an affair with Elizabeth Paton, who was one of his motheraposs servants. While Paton was pregnant Burns began a relationship with another woman, Jean Armour, who he met when she chased his dog away from her washing. She fell pregnant with twins in March , but her father forbade her to marry Burns.Burns then fell in love with a third woman, Mary Campbell, who he spotted in church. He wrote her ious poems, including Highland Mary , and there is some speculation that the pair planned to marry.It wasnapost to be. While nursing her brother, who had contracted typhus, Mary fell ill with the disease herself and died in October . Robert Burns poems Robert Burnsapos poetry career began to take off around the time of his relationships with Jean and Mary. He had been offered a job in Jamaica, and planned to emigrate.Burns didnapost have the money to pay for the journey, and so he began to sell his poems. He produced a collection, Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect , that was ultimately so successful that he decided against emigrating.  He stayed in Scotland and reconciled with Jean Armour. The pair married in , and went on to have nine children. Burns died in , at just -years-old.

The tradition was started in  - just six years after Burnsapos death - by the Burns Club of Greenock.

The following year parish records corrected their mistake, and they commenced the Burns Supper on  January.

He also wrote poems that inspired the titles of Catcher in the Rye and Of Mice and Men . J.D. Salinger was inspired by poem Comin Thro the Rye , while Steinbeckaposs title comes from a line in The Mouse - aposThe best laid schemes o’ mice an’ men   Gang aft agley’.

It spoke of the Queen and Prince Philipaposs fury after Andrew was pictured with topless women and touring red-light districts on a holiday in Phuket, Thailand. The Sunday People at the time revealed the Duke of Yorkaposs new friends were nicknamed the NyLon Gang because they went between New York and London with no expense spared.  Among the people in the gang was Ghislaine Maxwell, who it was said took Prince Andrew to nightclubs and parties.An insider told the Sunday People back in : Andrew has been told in no uncertain terms that he must cut loose from this gang with all their drug links before it drags the reputation of the Royals into the mire. His behaviour is not that expected of the Duke of York and he has been told it must end right now. Andrew is laying himself open to exploitation and scandal and is becoming an appalling liability. What sort of example does he set to the rest of the world  Reports have said Prince Andrew went on tours of red-light sex clubs with billionaire paedo Jeffrey Epstein and holidayed with pimp Ghislaine Maxwell while in Thailand. In a set of infamous photos, the Duke of York played up to his Playboy Prince moniker when he was seen surrounded by topless supermodels partying on a yacht off the coast of Thailand seaside resort, Phuket. Maxwell and Epstein were said to have been on the same holiday as Andrew, with the former thought to have stayed at his hotel. And the manager of a venue in Patongaposs red-light district said he was graced with a regal visit when the British prince visited the topless go-go bar. The wild holiday, which took place in New Year in , was around the time Prince Andrew became close with the couple - and just months before he allegedly sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre.  Andrew has vehemently denied this allegation and claims there was nothing improper about his relationship with the couple - who were both convicted of child sex crimes in the US. The Duke of York splashed out £,-a-night on a private villa at the lavish and ultra-exclusive Amanpuri Hotel in Phuket - where the couple also stayed, reports say. A Phuket-based journalist known as Lana told The Sun Online the resort is the go-to place for high-profile figures who need a high level of luxury and privacy.Spending his days on yachts with scantily-clad women, by night the Prince reportedly teamed up with Epstein to visit Patong - a notorious sex tourism hub where the streets are lined with go-go bars, massage parlours and other adult entertainment venues.  The pair visited the Banana Disco - a popular tourist nightclub which advertises itself online with videos of women wearing not much at all. The Queenaposs second son was said to have repeatedly visited a bar called Crazy Girls by Rock Hard, which is in a raunchy area where many of the girls are prostitutes.On Facebook, it says punters can enjoy the craziest and sexiest ass-smacking bar.Speaking to The Sunday Mirror at the time, the manager said: I was amazed to see the Prince here.

So itaposs no surprise that when one fan was luckily enough to meet Kate on a recent engagement, she was able to ask for some inside info on the beautul tan boots she was wearing.However, when she asked the royal where sheaposd purchased the boots from, Kate gave a rather surprising answer.The exchange was caught on camera last week when Kate and husband Prince William visited Lancashire and paid a visit to Church on the Street in Burnley - a centre that helps people struggling with poverty, homelessness, addiction and other problems. There they met with Trudi and Alastair Barrie, who work at the centre, with Kate even cradling their young baby daughter Anastasia.

Omicron is believed to be more transmissible than the previous Delta iant, but infection appears to be milder, similar to that of a cold. Now a ‘stealth’ version of the Omicron iant has appeared, leading to fears it could spark further waves of Covid- in the future.The strain, named as Omicron BA., has been classied as a “iant under investigation” by the UKHSA, but there are still huge gaps in our knowledge about the iant. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of Omicron to avoid further spread of infection.  Here we take a look at some of the lesser known symptoms to look out for. What are the symptoms of Omicron The main symptoms of coronavirus are a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell, according to the NHS.However, symptoms of the Omicron iant have been described as milder.According to the ZOE Covid Study, the top five symptoms identied were a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing and a sore throat.There are also other sign to look out for – particularly ones that affect your ears, eyes and head. Vertigo is a symptom that can occur during the “acute” phase of Covid infection, during the recovery process or as part of long Covid symptoms, says the NHS. Vertigo is a sensation of spinning or an altered sense of motion, or lightheadedness.The NHS adds: “Dizziness can also be linked with ringing in the ears, reduced hearing, eye strain and headaches.“These may come and go throughout the day. If they are constant or very intense, you should inform your healthcare professional as they may want to do some further investigations.”  According to the NHS, many studies have shown that Covid may cause headaches. It added: “Some people even get a headache before they notice any breathing problems. It is a common symptom of Covid. “Headaches are often a feature of other viral infections, but for most people the presence of a headache does not always mean that the virus is still present in the body.” According to Dr Konstantina Stankovic, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Stanford University, ear pain is becoming a common sign of infection. Brits will be well aware of the three main symptoms of coronavirus – a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell. These are the officially recognised symptoms according to the NHS. However, with the new Omicron iant, symptoms have been described as being more similar to a common cold.

The -year-old, from Burnley, Lancashire, gave the family-of-five £ to pay for food, gas and electricity to ensure they didnapost go hungry or freeze before their next payday.He described the job, which he was called out to on Saturday, as giving him a glimpse of actual poverty amid Britainaposs growing energy crisis, reports the Liverpool Echo. As energy bills skyrocket, tradesman James said similar scenes would soon be replicated around the country and called on the Government to act now to stop them.Have you been in a similar situation to James  Let us know at webnews@mirror  He said: “Where do we draw the line as a society and say aposNow we need to act apos “There’s a lot of stuff the Government can do to cut the cost of living by capping these companies that are charging stupid, extortionate, out of reality rates. “The poorest and the lowest in the country are always going to be penalised and expected to pay the most in the country out of everybody . It’s wrong, and it’s time for a change.”  James said he’d got a call from the family over the weekend as they were struggling to keep their heating on before they reached their next payday. He said: “They rang me to see whether there was anything we could do to help them get through until the next time they got paid. “I said I’d pop in and see what I could do. But when I got there, I realised the actual poverty that they’re living in and the impact all this is having on people. “You walk in and you’re talking to them, and you can see your breath while you’re talking to them. “They’ve got children there. They’re confused because they don’t know what’s going on. “The children are like aposWhy is this happening  Why am I cold  Why can’t my mum and dad keep me warm  Why can’t they put the boiler on  Why can’t they give me a meal apos Worryingly, James said this wasn’t the first time that he’d been in a home recently where he could see his own breath as families saved money by switching off their heating. He said: “Over the last few weeks, I’ve been to a few houses, not just families but elderly and disabled people as well, and you can see a plume of air coming out of their mouth. “It’s that cold you can see your words before you can bloody well hear them and that should not be acceptable in this day and age.

But it has been claimed that William often confided in her that he didn’t want to be king”.  And in reply, a young Harry is said to have declared: If you don’t want the job I’ll have it. According to royal expert Robert Jobson, this led to Diana privately calling Harry GKH - or Good King Harry. He told the Channel  programme William  Harry: Princes At War : “She used to refer to Harry as GKHbecause she thought he’d probably be better equipped for the role in the future than William.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

She said: aposWell, then you have to see that William’s very young at the moment, so do you want a burden like that to be put on his shoulders at such an age  So I can’t answer that question.”However, with William now just months away from his th birthday, one royal expert has said she believes he is now matured into his future royal role.Speaking to OK! former royal correspondent Jennie Bond said: She [Diana] said that he found at that age, in his early teens, the burden of kingship was already weighing quite heavily on his shoulders.I think we did see a reluctance to take on the role earlier on, in his early adolescence, he knew his destiny as none of the rest of us do from such an early age. But in the last couple of years, he has shown convincingly that he is the man for the role and that he cares about being king. He absolutely fully accepts the role and the responsibility destiny has put his way.

Lennox will be hugely missed by all of the staff at school, especially those who were privileged enough to teach and support him.

The -year-old, who lives in Plymouth, Devon, offers clips for £., with -minute versions available to buy at £.. She films her size  frame getting stuck in cars and doorways, as well as standing next to smaller people. Danielle says there is nothing pornographic about it - and just believes for some, bigger is better.  She said: “Thereaposs a lot of interest in seeing how my weight affects my daily le. “I used to wear baggy clothes to try and hide my weight but sharing my body online has boosted my confidence. I have realised that I may not be everyoneaposs cup of tea but there are people out there who appreciate my body. “I fall into the ‘supersized, big, beautul women’ bracket which is for ladies who weigh -lbs. “Iaposm lbs so evenI was to lose weight, I would still be in this category which seems to be very popular.” Danielle charges £. for five minute videos which will involve her trying on an outfit and £. for  minute videos. She adds: “The short videos are usually me trying on a cute outfit. “Whereas the longer ones might be a car tour which would show how I fit into one and others might be me getting stuck in a doorway. “Another video could involve squashing a smaller man or sitting in a hot tub causing the water to overflow. “Theres no denying what some people are using my content for without being crude but I do receive lovely messages from women.” Danielleaposs newfound love for her body has helped other women accept theirs too. The former chef also insists she isn’t promoting obesity.  She adds: “I am finally comfortable in my own skin but that doesn’t mean I am telling others to get fat. “I used to hate how I look but now I have a dferent outlook on it. “I don’t want to stay this size forever as I have limited mobility so I have reduced my calorie intake to , from , per day. I would be happy in size  clothing.” Danielle currently wears a size  on the bottom and  on the top. She paused her career as a chef and isnapost planning toto the kitchen any time soon.  “Now, I can use my weight to my advantage and make money, she added. “I can’t see myself going back to cheffing as it was long  hour days. Selling videos online gives me so much more freedom.” Danielle dedicates three days to filming content which is then posted throughout the week.

She adds: “Trolls and haters online say I look like a piece of meat and I am a disgrace. “They’ve also accused me of promoting obesity which I am not. I know this weight isn’t healthy but at the moment, I am fine with no underlying medical conditions. “I don’t know why my weight means I shouldn’t be able to love myself. “I think people should mind their own business,someone is struggling with their weight then being horrible and abusing them isn’t helping.

They are recruiting new staff to work with Harry and Meghanaposs Archewell Audio in Los Angeles for podcasts that feature the voices of high profile women.” One advert for a senior producer role at Gimlet Projects, Spotyaposs in-house production arm, states: We’re currently assembling a show team that will build and launch a new original show with Archewell featuring the voices of high profile women.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here The ideal candidate has experience working with high-profile talent, and an interest in the intersection of social activism and popular culture.” The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s only effort so far for Spoty has been a -minute aposholiday specialapos in December . It featured their friends James Corden and Elton John.  The couple’s lack of material comes despite the Sussexes employing podcast producer Rebecca Sanaes as their aposhead of audioapos at Archewell last year. A source told The Sun: Spoty has been waiting a long time for some content from Harry and Meghan and now it appears they have finally taken matters into their own hands. Hiring a raft of in-house talent on Spoty’s side will ensure they finally squeeze something out of them as they bid to honour their contract.It comes after a media lawyer suggested Harry and Meghan may not receive the full £ million from their contract with the streaming service.Speaking last month, media lawyer Ian Penman, who specialises in music streaming contracts, speculated that the venture is likely to have been less popular than Spoty and the royal couple expected.  He said: It would not be an unfair assumption that perhaps their popularity was not as great as maybe they or indeed Spoty initially felt. I think you could draw a conclusion that[Spoty] havenapost exercised the option on the next episode of the podcast, then maybe they did not have the popularity that either Meghan and Harry expected or indeed Spoty anticipated. Penman explained Spoty is unlikely to have lost out because they are unlikely to have paid the full £m upfront and are instead likely to have paid the Sussexes a small advance, retaining the right to back out of the contractthe first episode was not popular. He continued: It probably means that they have signed their first product, in this case, a podcast - they then have many, many options for further products. All those options are in Spotyaposs favour. Make no mistake, theyaposre not in Meghan and Harryaposs favour. After realising that the deal so far had cost them £, a minute, Spoty has reportedly been left mystied as to why the couple has not produced any content, according to The Sun. Meanwhile, Angela Levin, who has written a biography about the Prince, said: “Harry and Meghan want to do too many things at the same time.” The Mirror has contacted Spoty and Archewell for comment.

The streaming giant confirmed the royal pair would produce and host podcasts that uplts and entertains audiences around the world and feature erse perspectives and voices.The deal is reportedly worth £million and within days a trailer for the series, called Archewell Audio, was released. It was followed by a aposholiday specialapos episode lasting just over  minutes weeks later, with guests including James Corden and Sir Elton John.However, since then, there has been radio silence despite Spoty saying the first complete series was expected to drop in .  Here we take a look inside the multi-million-pound deal that seems to have gone sour... Signing the dealNews of Harry and Meghanaposs deal with Spoty first came in December . It followed them also signing an exclusive multi-year production deal for TV programming with Netflix having stepped back from royal duties earlier that year.At the time the partnership was announced, it was revealed that the coupleaposs newly formed Archewell Audio would produce programming that uplts and entertains audiences around the world and features erse perspectives and voices.

In the trailer for the podcast, it opens with Harry saying: Shall we start  Ladies first  Before Meghan adds: No, say it because I think it sounds really nice with your accent. They then go on to introduce Archewell Audio. Meghan explains: One of the things my husband and I have always talked about is our passion for meeting people and hearing their stories.  And no matter what the story, they usually offer you an understanding of where someone  is coming from and at the same time remind you in some way of a story about yourself. Harry then continues: And thataposs what this project is all about, to bring forward dferent perspectives and voices that perhaps you havenapost heard before and find our common ground. When that happens, change really is possible. Holiday special  Around two weeks after the deal was announced, Archewell Audioaposs first full- podcast - a holiday special - dropped. It included interviews with a number of impressive guests, including Sir Elton John and James Corden, but they saved the most special until the end.The proud parents brought their son Archie to the microphone, with Harry saying: You can speak into it.Meghan then asks: Archie is it fun  and he repeats the word fun. The tot then copies his dad to say Happy New Year, followed by an adorable giggle.The podcast show notes description read: As we come to the end of the year, Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, present a special collection of inspiration, reflection, and perspective from guests around the world, including Stacey Abrams, Christina Adane, José Andrés, Brené Brown, Rachel Cargle, Deepak Chopra, James Corden, Matt Haig, Sir Elton John, Hussain Manawer, Naomi Osaka, Tyler Perry, and George the Poet .Curated throughout the month of December, join them as they reflect on the year, speak openly about the power of compassion, and toast to a hopeful . Wait for content However, following the holiday special, there has been no more episodes from Archewell Audio. This means the total running time of their podcast so far has been  minutes and  seconds. This means the podcast has cost around £,-a-minute for the content produced so far. Last year in June, the couple welcomed their baby daughter Lilibet and after her birth, they both took several months of parental leave.However, at the time, industry sources insisted the deal was still on track saying information on the next episode was expected later in the year.It was later reported that the couple had been given a gentle nudge to produce more content One source told the Sun : “Spoty were delighted when they signed the couple, but the lack of content has mystied them. Particularly as they seem to have no problem producing content for other s.”Less popular than expected  By the end of , new podcast episodes still hadnapost appeared - leading to one media lawyer to suggest Harry and Meghan may not receive the full £million for the deal. Speaking last month, media lawyer Ian Penman, who specialises in music streaming contracts, speculated that the venture is likely to have been less popular than Spoty and the royal couple expected. He said: It would not be an unfair assumption that perhaps their popularity was not as great as maybe they or indeed Spoty initially felt. I think you could draw a conclusion that[Spoty] havenapost exercised the option on the next episode of the podcast, then maybe they did not have the popularity that either Meghan and Harry expected or indeed Spoty anticipated. Penman explained Spoty is unlikely to have lost out because they are unlikely to have paid the full £m upfront and are instead likely to have paid the Sussexes a small advance, retaining the right to back out of the contractthe first episode was not popular. Spoty take charge Now it seems that Harry and Meghanaposs podcast venture is being taken into the streaming giantaposs “own hands”. Spoty are hiring a number of in-house producers to help deliver on the deal after waiting more than a year for any material. They are recruiting new staff to work with Harry and Meghanaposs Archewell Audio in Los Angeles for podcasts that feature the voices of high profile women.” One advert for a senior producer role at Gimlet Projects, Spotyaposs in-house production arm, states: We’re currently assembling a show team that will build and launch a new original show with Archewell featuring the voices of high profile women The ideal candidate has experience working with high-profile talent, and an interest in the intersection of social activism and popular culture.” The couple’s lack of material comes despite the Sussexes employing podcast producer Rebecca Sanaes as their aposhead of audioapos at Archewell last year. A source told The Sun: Spoty has been waiting a long time for some content from Harry and Meghan and now it appears they have finally taken matters into their own hands. Hiring a raft of in-house talent on Spoty’s side will ensure they finally squeeze something out of them as they bid to honour their contract. The Mirror has contacted Spoty and Archewell for comment.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.The second lunch box contains cheese and tomato sandwich, fruit, vegetable sticks and a yoghurt. The first box contains twice the sugar and half the second packed lunch. Andthat wasnapost enough to send alarm bells ringing for parents, the contents of the unhealthier box also happen to cost twice as much, due to most of it being pre-packaged items.Speaking to news.au, Cancer Council NSW’s senior nutrition program officer Nina Tan explained that many parents buy pre-packaged snacks for school because it saves time - or because children really want them.She said: When it comes to pre-packaged foods, companies are plastering them with nutrition-related marketing claims like ‘source of calcium’ or ‘no articial…’, and adding colours, cartoon characters and fonts designed to draw in both parents and kids.  Bright colours, cartoon animals and fun shapes are used to attract children, and text like ‘no need to chill’ and ‘the perfect lunch box biscuits’ are used to appeal to parents’ desire to make easy and quick lunch box choices for their kids, but these snacks can be packed with sugar, salt and kilojoules and often don’t provide children with the nutrients they need.Cancer Council NSW recently assessed  popular lunch box snacks in Australia and found nearly  per cent could be classied as unhealthy. Ms Tan added that they were particularly concerned by the results given the role lunch box snacks played in a children’s diet.In an attempt to tackle this concern, the council have since set up a website for parents to help them pack healthier lunches.

Therefore, itaposs understandable that many parents would take issue with those who take a less respectful approach to this sensitive topic, as demonstrated by a backlash sparked by new podcast,The No Filter Pod .Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.For those who havenapost tuned in, The No Filter Pod was launched earlier this month, with hosts Anthony Casasanta, Nick Casasanta, and Jason Girratano hailing it as “the most blunt podcast in the world”.Previous episodes see the hosts make assertions such as women cheat more than men!! and wing women donapost exist!!, prompting a fair bit of mockery in the comments section. However, one particular clip has gone viral which will exasperate anyone who has carried a child for nine months before going through the pains of labour, and indeed those whoaposve watched their other half go through it. In this vid, Anthony Casasanta can be heard claiming that,his future we lets herself go after childbirth, he would threaten to leave her.In the clip, which has been viewed over . million times on TikTok, Casasanta vows: If my we lets herself go after I have kids with her, I’m going to tell her once.If you don’t get your sh*t together, because I still want to be sexually attracted to my we, my spouse, butyou can’t do that, I’m out’. The comments on the TikTok video and Instagram have since been disabled, with the hosts telling the Mirror that they and members of their extended family have received death threats. However, this measure hasnapost stopped the ridicule from pouring in.Commenting under the full episode, which has been uploaded to YouTube, one person expressed concerns about innocent minds being influenced by such views, urging any young boys man girls women watching to treat yourself and women with respect and kindness and at the end that will get you what matters most. A second person remarked that they would like to see the hostsapos own mothers reacting to the vid, while a third stated that they would be filing orce papers that same daytheir spouse issued this sort of ultimatum.  One reaction video, from body confidence influencer Alex Light has gained signicant traction, having been viewed over .k times. In this clip, a visibly repulsed Light describes Casasantaaposs declaration as being one of the worst things I’ve seen for a long time.Light, who regularly makes videos about eating disorder recovery and diet culture, said: So, a woman – your future we, God help her – pushes an entire human out of her vagina and you want her to stay skinny, or at least get skinny, straight away – andshe doesn’t, you’ll leave her. What you’re saying is that when you get married, you’re not looking for a partnership, that’s not what you want. She continued: You want to own and control your we. You want her to look and behave a certain way – your way – you want her to conform to your standards andshe doesn’t, she’s gone. What a f***ing idiot man. In a joint comment made to The Mirror, the hosts said that although they expected the comments to be negative, they really feel as the video was taken out of context. The hosts claim they were talking years down the line after childbirth, rather than straight afterward, explaining that they just don’t want our wives to be obese.  The hosts continued: We feel associety promotes obesity which is a very unhealthy and uncomfortable way of living. We promote healthy lestyles here at NoFilterPod. It’s also not only about weight gain after childbirth, it’s also about mental health as well as physical health. We feel like it’s very important to hold spouses both men and women to a high standard.Considering those whoaposve ridiculed them online, the podcasters admit they are not sorry about the comments made during the episode, stating This is what we prefer and we’re allowed to have our opinion on things just like they’re allowed to have their views on certain things. They added: It’s none of our business what their opinion on things are, therefore they should respect our view. We hear and see all the hate that we are getting,you don’t like what we say simply don’t watch or listen to our podcast.Have you encountered this sort of attitude  Get in touch.

And one woman on Reddit has split the opinion of people online after she shared the story of her dadaposs funeral - as it also happened to be the first time sheaposd ever met his girlfriend of five years. Posting her story anonymously, the woman explained she found out about her dadaposs relationship two years after he started dating, after she saw text messages on his phone, the Irish Mirror reports.But her dad never spoke about his girlfriend, named Pam, and never introduced her to his daughter - leaving them to meet for the first time when she arrived uninvited to his funeral, which had been organised by his daughter. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.The woman wrote on Reddit : I was aposofficiallyapos told about Pam when I collected my dadaposs office things after he died, and a large photo of her was there. His colleagues were stunned I didn’t know. I threw that photo away right there. I made all the funeral arrangements. Pam tried contacting Dad’s phone messenger- I assume she saw all the posts on his Facebook and the funeral date online. I never responded to her.Yet before his wake started, Pam and her family showed up - and planned to be a part of the services! I came in at pm for the pm wake, and she and her three sons, daughters-in-law, and grandkids were there talking with some of his friends. She’s known them all for - years! The daughter was asked by the funeral directors and some guests why she hadnapost invited Pam, and she admitted it was because she didnapost know her - but Pam claimed the woman had refused to meet her.  She added: I was floored. The funeral people asked me why I didn’t include her since she’s his signicant other. I told them right in front of everyone that I’ve lived with my dad over the last five years and I never met or knew her. At this point, Pam got out of the provided chair and tried to play it cool by saying aposOh come now!apos while pulling me aside to aposchatapos. During this chat, she told me aposYou’re going to embarrass yourself and fatheryou don’t just keep it together. I canapost believe you refused to meet me until now but that was your choice. Now let’s get through this and figure it out later.apos The woman said she lost it at Pamaposs words, and kicked her dadaposs girlfriend and her family out of the service. She said: Pam wanted to stay because in her mind she was all but legally his we. I said no, because I’m the family, and she should have thought this through.  Right before the  pm service, she and her whole family left, and it was just me facing, among other things, constant questionings of aposWhere’s Pam  Why couldn’t Pam come  We saw Pam outside leaving, why did you do that apos Commenters on the Reddit post were split over whether the woman did the right thing, with some saying the real bad guy in the situation was her dad. One person wrote: Yikes. Based on what you’ve said here, the real a**hole is your dad. He told Pam you didn’t want to meet her, he didn’t tell you that she exists, and then he dies and leaves you to sort it out  While another said: Dad is the a**hole but so is Pam. Even with him telling her you didn’t want to meet. If I were in that position, the first thing anyone would do is talk to the daughter and offer sympathy.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.At the very least not walk in there and act like it’s your show and you’re the centre of attention. She had no right to bring her whole family and start moving stuff around. But others sided with Pam, as they pointed out that she had just as much right to grieve the loss of her boyfriend as anybody  at the funeral. Someone posted: It seems like your dad told Pam that you didnapost want to meet her. I have been taught not to speak ill of the dead so I will go with [not an a**hole], but you are getting a pass only because you were clearly grieving. You were unconscionably rude to someone who was clearly very important to your father at a time when she was also grieving. As another agreed, writing: [Not an a**hole] but youaposre angry at your dad and Pam is a representation of everything he ever did wrong by you.Do you have a story to share  Email yourmirror@trinitymirrorRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FuneralsRelationshipsUmm what Reddit\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Instead of taking her to a hospital or doctor, Jason consulted a QAnon Telegram group chat with tens of thousands of people who think Covid is a hoax. Vice reported the conversation that followed.Jason wrote in the group: “Do you guys think it’s safe to give ivermectin to an infant ”Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medicine used to treat infestations in humans including head lice.  Two years ago researchers claimed it could kill off the virus which causes Covid, but there is no clinical evidence to support this and it is widely accepted amongst medical professionals that it should not be taken. The group however, was not medical professionals and they had spent months sharing tips on how best to obtain the drug. One group member responded: “Baby aspirin to thin the blood a little and drop any fever and I would put some ivermectin on the bottoms of her feet,”  Other conspiracy theorists on the chat said he should wait to take advice from “experts” in ivermectin, in the group. One so-called ‘expert’ called Katie said: “From what I understand, yes it is safe to give to an infant, however please stop calling it Covid, it’s not Covid, it’s a simple cold. That’s how we got in this mess to begin with.” Jason took the advice and gave his baby a dose of ivermectin. “We gave her two doses of ivermectin at mg each. That’s what was recommended by someone on here. She got really sick after that. Related  I don’t know.” Jason said. Within minutes Jason said that his little girl’s condition was worsening. He said: “Baby threw up. Is that common side effect  She’s also turning a tad blue.” Someone  said this exact thing had happened to their child, and that they then took their child to hospital.Jason said: “We don’t trust hospitals. I told my son to give her more ivermectin.”Group members begged Jason to take his daughter to hospital. One member called Barbara said: “That baby needs to go to the ER. Do not hesitate. “I’ve seen too many go south due to O levels being low. The blue is hypoxia and that’s lack of oxygen at the tissue level. Please!”  Jason eventually told the group he had taken his child to hospital. “[My] son is taking baby to urgent care. Against my wishes but I’m praying for her. It’s in God’s hands now.” He later said she was “doing better”. He added: “God knew what to do even though I thought hospital was certain death.

In Australia, the Therapeutics Goods Administrationhas placed restrictions on the prescribing of oral ivermectin amid a spike in demand.The TGA said: “These changes have been introduced because of concerns with the prescribing of oral ivermectin for the claimed prevention or treatment of Covid-.“Ivermectin is not approved for use in Covid- in Australia or in other developed countries, and its use by the general public for Covid- is currently strongly discouraged by the National COVID Clinical Evidence Taskforce, the World Health Organisation and the US Food and Drug Administration.” “Firstly, there are a number of signicant public health risks associated with taking ivermectin in an attempt to prevent Covid- infection rather than getting vaccinated,” it said. “Iniduals who believe that they are protected from infection by taking ivermectin may choose not to get tested or to seek medical carethey experience symptoms. Doing so has the potential to spread the risk of Covid- infection throughout the community. “Secondly, the doses of ivermectin that are being advocated for use in unreliable social media posts and other sources for Covid- are signicantly higher than those approved and found safe for scabies or parasite treatment. “These higher doses can be associated with serious adverse effects, including severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, neurological effects such as dizziness, seizures and coma. “Finally, there has been a --fold increased dispensing of ivermectin prescriptions in recent months, leading to national and local shortages for those who need the medicine for scabies and parasite infections. “It is believed that this is due to recent prescribing and dispensing for unapproved uses, such as Covid-. Such shortages can disproportionately impact vulnerable people, including those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON World Health OrganisationERBabiesHospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old told staff he didnapost believe the disease even existed when he arrived at the hospital on January . It was also revealed that his -year-old father, who also doesnapost believe the disease exists, is currently in the same hospital fighting for his le on a ventilator.  Luigiaposs condition quickly worsened over  hours, and he was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure as one of the consequences of the disease, and was moved to intensive care. Tragically, while there, he continued to refuse treatment and even removed his oxygen mask. Silvia Cavalli, the director of the local health authority in Latina, said it was only later that doctors persuaded him to leave it in place.  But it was too late to save him. He died five days later after his condition deteriorated, leaving behind a fiancee. Both father and son had refused to get vaccinated. Local health counsellor Alessio DaposAmato was among those pointing out the tragedy of the -year-old manaposs death, saying it should dispel the myth that young people do not die from the disease.Italy has recorded more than million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and , people have died , according to the Johns Hopkins University.

Declan Haughney, , and another man brought Peadar Doyle, , to the post office to collect his pension on Friday, not realising he had died.During the funeral service on Monday, priest Fr Thomas Little said “no one should ever point a finger” after what happened, the Irish Mirror reports. The emotional service brought together Peadaraposs family at the Church of the Holy Family in Co Carlow. Declan was seen carrying his uncleaposs coffin as Peadar’s niece, Charmaine gave a speech about how he was “a hero” and “like a father” to her and others.  She said: “Peadar treated each and every one of his nieces and nephews aswe were his own children – and he was like a second father to us all.” Charmaine added: “Peadar’s positivity was contagious. He was witty and had a great memory of quotes from classical movies, literature and poetry.” She told how Peadar was a perfectionist” and a great cook, cleaner, had worked as a caretaker and a waiter. He was also an exceptional painter, she said.  She said her uncle “made you feel cared for, special and loved in a way no one  could”. She added: “Peadar was a quiet man who was always proud of and devoted to his family. In public, he was dignied and polite – kind and cheerful to everyone he met. “To him, loving and caring for his family and making so many memories with them was what was most important to him.”  Charmaine ended her eulogy by saying her uncle was someone whose greatness wasn’t known to many, but to those closest to him, he was their everything. She added: “He has made a monumental impression on our hearts and on our souls. His heart was bigger than himself and I’m so lucky to have had such a teacher in my le.” A Garda investigation into the circumstances of the events surrounding Peadar’s death and his escorted walk remains active – though no one has been arrested. Declan previously told the Irish Mirror how he was branded a “murderer” in the local community ever since the sensational story emerged.But he insisted he’s “not an eejit” – and believes he’s being accused of dragging his dead uncle into a post office to rob his pension because he previously stole from his aunt. He said: “Why would I want to rob my uncle  I’m  years of age yeah, I’m not a child, I’m not a young fella. I’m not an eejit to walk into Hoseys with a dead man and collect his money. Am I cuckoo  Am I cuckoo  I’m not.”  The priest added: “I would like to say too that I was deeply saddened and shocked at the way that his untimely and sad death has been portrayed. “It wasn’t fair to you as a family, it wasn’t fair to Peadar and it was so wrong to have done such a thing. “Nobody should ever point a finger at anybody because as Peadar would say to youyou point a finger at somebody, you know there are three fingers pointing back to you.” The priest continued: “We know that and I know that too and it’s very hurtful and I’m just sorry for the family for that to have happened. “It shouldn’t have happened, but I will say this too – it was uplting to see the number of people that turned out yesterday in the quiet and gentle way to light their candle on the street where he lived. “It shows that goodness always wins out in the long run. Peadar was bigger and better than all the criticism and the horrible things that were said. “He was far bigger than any of that and I do deeply believe he is with his God, to be reunited with his family, his brothers, his father and mother and those that have gone before him.” Garda Superintendent Aidan Brennan, who is leading the investigation, said they want to “establish when exactly Mr Doyle died”. Supt Brennan told KCLR FM that gardai have spoken with the men who brought Mr Doyle to the post office and received “good co-operation” from them.

Declan Haughney, , insists that he was not trying to rob his deceased relative Peadar Doyle, , after he and another man dragged him for five minutes from his home to collect his pension from a Post Office in Hoseys, Ireland last Friday morning.Declan, , told the Irish Mirror he’s now “the talk of the town” and has been branded a “murderer” in the local community ever since the sensational story emerged. But he insisted he’s “not an eejit” – and believes he’s being accused of dragging his dead uncle into a post office to rob his pension – because he previously stole from his aunt. He said: “Why would I want to rob my uncle  I’m  years of age yeah, I’m not a child, I’m not a young fella. I’m not an eejit to walk into Hoseys with a dead man and collect his money. Am I cuckoo  Am I cuckoo  I’m not.”  Declan, who admits he used to have a drug problem, and who served two years in prison, says he’s now being accused of knowingly bringing his dead uncle in to get his pension – because of his past. He told us: “That’s why they’re saying it, that’s why this is all coming up now – because I done it before. A bank card came through the aunt’s door and I got the pin code and went down for fraud and that’s why this is all coming up. “People know about that in the town you know. But that was  years ago. I’m off the gear three years and I’m doing well.”  And Declan, who has a black eye and facial injuries after allegedly being attacked following the incident last Friday, revealed that he now believes his uncle was dead before he even reached the post office. Declan says he believes Peadar may have been dead by the time he and another male got him under the bridge at Pollerton Road, which is less than a two-minute walk from his home – but the pair continued to bring him to the post office by linking arms with him and dragging him there.  When the pair propped Mr Doyle up against the counter a member of staff contacted the Irish gardai.Both men, one of whom is said to have known Mr Doyle ‘very well’, have since made full statements to the police investigating the incident from Friday.  Officers believe he may have died around three hours before his impromptu trip to Hosey’s newsagents and post office in Carlow with the men, despite the claims that he was alive. Fr John Dunphy, the priest who delivered the last rites to Mt Doyle, said he received a call from police saying his remains had been left at the shop in ‘shocking circumstances.’ Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Post OfficePensionsCrimeFunerals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Or,Putin is simply flexing his military might as a political bargaining tool. During scheduled aposwar gamesapos early last year, Moscow was able to sht battle tanks and artillery under the radar, with the bulk of what could form an attack support network left idly in position in open dispersal camps. Tens of thousands of troops also failed to go home after the manoeuvres were over. Russia is now mobilising specialist equipment and other supplies, including ammunition carriers to its aposfrontlineapos. It is bringing the crucial combat s and enabling capabilities and units it will need to move forward with an assault.  Added to this are the last-minute training exercises Russia has announced in subservient Belarus - a large-scale war game named Allied Resolve . There have also been fresh cyberattacks striking in Ukraine in recent days. According to the Snowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, these are all major clues for imminent war. But thereaposs one last move Putin hasnapost played yet and, according to Colonel John Barranco, itaposs a deal-breaker. Russia is going to need to call up reservists out of civilian leit is serious about invading and occupying all or most of Ukraine, the senior US Marine Corps fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank says, reports NZ Herald. Thataposs going to have an economic impact and cause discontent among the public, so Moscow is unlikely to do it unless itaposs serious. Many of Russiaaposs most high-profile modern weapons are being moved into position, with the war games allowing for plausible deniability.  But members of the think tank also agree thereaposs an element of parading to Moscowaposs behaviour. Moving vulnerable assault ships from the Barents and Baltic Seas, for example, they say doesnapost make much sense when it would be easier to move equipment by rail. Instead, the presence of such vessels could be a sign of gunboat diplomacy.  Russia wants legally-binding guarantees that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO. Putin has made it clear he sees such a deal - which would mean his old foe is backed by a -strong military alliance - as a threat to Russia’s borders. The Russian leader last month warned the US sanctions against the Kremlin over its build-up of border troops would be a “huge error” that would lead to a breakdown of relations.  Ukraine split from the now-defunct USSR in  and set about building new allegiances with western nations, leading to continued tensions with Russia. In , the Kremlin seized Ukraineaposs Crimean peninsula and in response to mass protests saw Ukraine oust its pro-Russian president. Russia retaliated by backing a separatist insurgency in Ukraineaposs east, with continued skirmishes on the border ever since.  A  peace agreement was brokered but Russia then accused Ukraine of breaking it, with compliance from the West. On Monday, the Kremlin claimed Ukraine is more ready to launch an assault than ever before.

I just love all of the bright colours from the oranges and maroons to the yellows. When I first moved into my flat, I already had a vision of how I wanted it to look, as I hated the boring grey carpet and white walls that came as a default.I followed a lot of Instagram accounts and Pinterest threads for inspiration. Isabella spent five months renovating her flat last year with bargains she found through Facebook Marketplace and local charity shops.She said: I tried to decorate my flat on a budget, so scoured thrt shops and items on Facebook to try and get cheap vintage furniture. I just love bamboo furniture, as itaposs how I imagine most houses were furnished during the s and s. I got a bamboo dining table for £ and four chairs to match off of Marketplace for £. I found a tulip lamp from an independent shop on Instagram for £, which was probably the most expensive part of the renovation, but itaposs beautul and really lights up the place. One of my favourite pieces is the orange space age shelving unit I have underneath my television to store records and trinkets, that was £. I got a bucket of yellow and orange paint to do a feature wall in my bedroom and the living area and combined it cost about £. Isabella also picked up a range of other items to add to her s paradise including wall plants for £, two shag rug carpets for £ and an orange tan couch for £. Her finishing touches include a range of floral prints and cat pictures, making her home completely unrecognisable. She has transformed her flat from drab and plain with white walls and grey carpets, to bright and interesting. She added: All of the colours make for an incredible airy and bright space which I love. I added lots of plants to the space as well, which gives it that freshness and makes it smell amazing. I have two cats who just really fit into the space as well as they are both orange, a lot of people seem to think I bought them to match the decor! Alongside her passion for s decor, Isabella also has a wardrobe worth more than £ packed full of vintage styles and fashionable items. She said: I try to be as low impact and as environmentally friendly as possible, so try and get all of my clothes from thrt stores. Thrt stores are my favourite place to get flared jeans from, which I wear daily. I also try and buy my tops and dresses from independent sellers, or second hand online. If something rips, I always try and fix itI can.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

deaths of people who have tested positiveThere were  people in intensive care on Monday, January  with recently confirmed COVID- and , people were in hospital yesterday with recently confirmed

marine environment is crucialwe want them to help protect it. It#s so heartening to experience the children#s energy, enthusiasm and awe when learning about whales and dolphins.Our sessions are so important as they spark passion and interest in the local environment and encourage conversations about the actions that we can all take to help protect it, now and in the future.Players of People#s Postcode Lottery have supported the charity, raising £, since  to support the development and delivery of new and immersive learning experiences that bring the marine environment to le for children in coastal communities.Our latest creative project, funded by People#s Postcode Trust and Sea-Changers, has been to launch the best of their education sessions online, working with schools and home educators across Scotland and England.Based around the trust#s research expeditions, these digital sessions introduce the amazing ersity of whales, dolphins and sharks in Scotland and give children a glimpse into what it is like to work at sea, studying and protecting ocean giants.Prior to the pandemic, every year school groups would join the charity#s crew on board their research vessel, Silurian, as she was temporarily transformed into a floating classroom.The famous yacht has now visited communities on most of the larger Hebridean islands including Mull, Skye, Islay, Lewis, Harris, Uist, Barra, Coll, Tiree and the Small Isles as well as some of the largest towns along Scotland#s west coast, such as Oban, Mallaig and Ullapool.Raising awareness and aspirations for green careers features at the centre of the charity#s education strategy.Each year the trust runs dedicated research expeditions for - and -year-olds on board Silurian.These young adults gain hands-on experience monitoring marine le, including collecting data as part of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust long-term citizen science project, which informs local and national conservation efforts.Anyone can help the charity monitor marine le, by reporting their sightings of cetaceans – the collective name for whales, dolphins and porpoises – and basking sharks online.The trust also offers guided field trips for schools, so that younger children can take part and experience the thrill of spotting seabirds and marine mammals from land.Local wildle is not only amazing to see, but each species also has an important biological role to play.By protecting whales and giving marine ecosystems the chance to recover, we can improve the health and resilience of our seas and in turn the climate and planet for us all.We#re really proud to support the next generation of ocean ambassadors and look forward to when Silurian can once again become a floating classroom and set sail for island schools.In the meantime, teachers or home educators keen to take part in our online sessions are encouraged to get in touch by emailing info@hwdt.org"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 7 2022","story":"He followed a very dferent path.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

Each day there is a plethora of indignation either for or against the SNP and or the Prime Minister.The other day I laughed out loud at Dr Gerald Edwards and his complaint that the SNP was making political mileage out of Boris Johnson’s behaviour. What on earth does any political party do when their opposite numbers self-destruct It never ceases to amaze me how certain correspondents’ blood pressure goes through the roof at the mere mention of the SNP. That is, until I realised I had the very same reaction to the sight or sound of Greta Thunberg.But what is independence  For me it is to separate from the voters in and around London who have dominated our Scottish world for decades. It is not about being anti-English, as I have the same liking for them as I do for French, German, Scandinavian or other peoples.I have written in the past about the pound and economy and, to tell the truth, those letter writers who expound on this or that percentage just leave me cold.

It stated that Lord Hailsham’s speech at the installation ceremony was reported at the time as providing a \"profound and noble start\" to his rectorship. Students at the university had not always been so well-behaved.His Lordship was in a fortunate position compared with his predecessor, Rab Butler, elected as Rector in  when Home Secretary. He had been greeted by the students at his installation with an exotic array of egg, flour and tomato. Lord Boyd Orr, University Chancellor, also got caught up in this salvo and, obviously not sitting on the fence, referred to the students as \"moronic, witless and humourless\".Butler, however, appeared to be composed about the boisterous conduct of the students, observing that he had witnessed much over the years in the House of Commons, though it had never got as far there as a selection of food items being thrown at him.Perhaps he was prepared to accept that the behaviour on that day could be embraced within the sentiments of the song\"Gaudeamus igitur, Juvenes dum sumus\" .Ian W Thomson, Lenzie."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-nicola-sturgeon-must-know-no-case-independence","story":"It seems to me that the reason that Ms Sturgeon concentrates on the process of independence – ie, endless referendums – is because she knows that there is no credible case for independence itself. She indulges in displacement activity in place of effective action.There is no economic case for Scottish independence. Every effort to produce one runs into the sands of hard facts and evidence, which show clearly that Scotland benefits from pooling and sharing within the UK to the tune of around £ billion annually and would be so much poorer after separation. And the EU will not ride to the rescue of a country with such a large deficit, without its own currency, no central bank and few foreign reserves.There is no historical case. Scotland is not a colony and is not suppressed in any way as part of the UK. Scots and Scotland have benefited greatly, and continue to do so, from being part of team GB.There is no cultural case. The lives and attitudes of city dwellers in Aberdeen or Glasgow are little dferent from the same sample in Birmingham, Bristol or Cardf. Rural le in England is much the same as rural le Scotland or Wales.There is no legal case. The UK is a unitary state formed by the willing agreement of all parties in the Act of Union and its legal status has never been challenged.There is no geographical case. We are  million people crammed on to a small island. The very idea of splitting it up into dferent countries in a world where size and influence matters could serve as the very definition of foolishness.And importantly, there is no democratic case. We had our referendum. The outcome was decisive and should put the question to bed for at least a generation.Instead of continually distracting the faithful with referendums that never happen, Ms Sturgeon should be considering why, after  years in existence, her party has dismally failed to create even the semblance of an evidence-led case for independence. Let me give her a clue: there is no such case, it does not exist, it never has.Alex Gallagher, Labour councillor, Largs.KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROADWHAT a tease that Nicola Sturgeon is. She told us in May that a vote for the SNP was a vote to support her management of the Covid crisis. Now she tells us that voting SNP meant supporting her next push for Indyref, for which she claims a mandate. She has promised her troops a referendum before the end of , and she will soon set out the legislative timetable for her referendum.Yet Ms Sturgeon also tells us that the course of the pandemic remains \"highly unpredictable\". Further, the Holyrood legislative timetable has no mention of a referendum bill. That is before Ms Sturgeon encounters a no-doubt-polite refusal from the UK Government to sanction a second referendum. She admits that she hasn’t decided on the date for the introduction of the referendum bill, but she will take that decision in the next few weeks, to enable a referendum to be held before the end of .We have been here before, year after year since , and in each year the can has been kicked a bit further down the road.

If ever we needed convincing of the need for self-determination, the need to run our own affairs, the evidence is all there. The illegal prorogation of Parliament, parties while the country was in lockdown, dodgy decoration donations, Tory MPs breaking lobbying rules, the list could go on and begs the questio:, why would we want to be part of this scandal and corruption Over the last month or so the media has reported that there is still plenty of support for Boris Johnson south of the Border, highlighting Mr Mackays point about separating from voters around London. It is predicted here in Scotland that the Conservatives will be wiped out at the next Westminster election, revealing the clear gap between voters in Scotland and those in England. Scotland seriously can’t afford another Westminster Government she did not vote for, she can’t afford any more legislation from Westminster regarding reserved matters and she certainly can’t afford Mr Johnson for a day longer than necessary.

There will be little talk of the enormous problems he tackled successfully, the health problems including intensive care and lately with his family just intense speculation on a successor – followed by a frantic searching for dirton that successor possibly going back to schooldays and a cigarette smoked behind the bicycle sheds. I suspect that there will follow a similar trashing of the leader of the Labour Party by the extreme left in order to re-instate their man.Is this what we have sunk to as a nation, no longer seeking people of actionbut media-attractive popular personalities  No longer talking about a desire to serve, but an unhealthy grasping at power for powers sake  No longer outlining what we hope to achieve in the next  months but how much we will spend usually multiplied over three or five years because it looks better and hides any temptation to link spend to success  No longer putting forward solutions to problems but articulately outlining that something is a challenge and expecting praise for identying it Heaven help uswe ever have to go to war –we do find a leader with the courage to make the dficult big decisions – we, through the media, will drag him or her down with distracting information or demand openness that will render a successful outcome impossible.James Watson, Dunbar.THE GLOBAL AGGRESSORIT looks asUkraine is heading for meltdown, leading to the general public fearing Russia and its territorial aspirations, as that is what we are repeatedly told to do.Last year, just like every other preceding year, one country alone was responsible for more than  per cent of all the money spent on Planet Earth on weapons of war meanwhile the standard of living of its own citizens is in decline. Since its creation, that itself by war, other than for five years, that rapacious country has been continuously involved overtly or covertly in armed conflict in some distant part of the globe: it currently has in the order of , servicemen stationed abroad, many actively involved in fighting and killing in at least six countries, on occasion against the wishes of their elected governments. Annually it gives military aid of . billion to one foreign government which is used to further the apartheid policy of its recipient against its indigenous population. The country I describe spies electronically on the general public of its allies to circumvent unhelpful legislation that prevents their own governments from doing so without specic legal permission. Its historic clandestine involvement in the politics of Ukraine is likely to cause a war which could spread to other European states. So we have every right to be afraid of this country, the only thing being that I’m not describing Russia, but the United States.The facts are that in  US military spending was  billion, Russia bn and the UK bn.

One was brought by the Celts from the Iberian peninsula, the other by people from Ukraine.These two populations of Scots pines remain, thousands of years on, genetically distinct, and also separate in distribution.The pines brought here from the Iberian peninsula cover the landscape to the west of Loch Ness, those from the Ukraine occupy the east of that line.One of the reasons Rawlence finds them so interesting, he says, is because they are part of a much wider story, which he tells, of how humans and trees have long been interlinked.“What I hope people take away, overall, is that the way that the boreal has evolved in lots of dferent places is contingent upon humans. It has always been. We have always been entangled with its destiny. We have co-evolved together. And that’s just as true for the larch as it is for the spruce as it is for the Scots pine or the birch. The reindeer grazing create the conditions for the birch. It’s all interlinked.”He tells the story of six key species which form the treeline, Scots pine, birch, larch, spruce, poplar and rowan, and how climate change is impacting not just their distribution but the lives of the people who have lived for millennia alongside them.But it’s the Scots pine I most want to talk with him about. I’ve long been a lover myself of the tree – the way its branches stretch their needles this way and that seeking out the sun, throwing expressive shapes. I can remember the realisation that this tree that cloaked the edge of Scottish lochs, was the same that filled the air with pine scent between holiday campsite and beach in France.That was an early glimmering that this tree we call Scots may not be ours, later confirmed when a Swedish friend Jannica Honey talked to me for my book, For The Love Of Trees, about a pine she called simply the Tall, which, when she found it here, would remind her of home. The tree we call Scots has many homes, and many peoples have a relationship with it.You only have to go back around  years to find a history in which Scots pine is arriving as an invasive species, brought here from the Iberian peninsula and Ukraine. The name tells us little about where it really came from, and more about the colonising role that Britain had in global history.As Rawlence puts it, “All of this stuff is tangled up with everything  – the dominance of Britain and colonialism how we see and name things.”Research into genetics and archaeology has uncovered these stories of the tree’s past.: Fellowship of the rings: Why we must protect our ancient trees“The provenance,” says Rawlence, “of the western group of Scots pine is quite well established. They were brought from Iberia by Celts moving up the river estuaries. There’s quite a strong archaeological record of the pines moving up the west coast of Britain and then spreading into Caledonia on time scales which were much faster than they would have been had they been regenerating naturally. The only plausible explanation is that they were brought by humans.”The Celts from Iberia were, he says, effectively travelling “with their own habitat, the pine”, the tree that provided them with food and other resources, with flour even, which could be made from its bark. Meanwhile, people from Ukraine, where a refugium of Scots pines had lingered since the previous Ice Age were also taking their special tree with them. Recent research has shown that the eastern population of Scottish pines is genetically very similar to those pines. Again, it was people who brought the tree, as they migrated across to the Sami territories of Norway and then over the North Sea to Scotland.The tree and the people have both left their mark on the Scotland of today and its gene pools. The red hair of the Ukrainian migrants, and the black of the Celts, exist alongside the trees that they brought with them. Rawlence says that we even find traces of this migration in folklore and oral history. When he mentioned his reearch to ethnobotanist Diana Beresford- Kroeger, she immediately connected it to Celtic stories which tell of how Iberians met the Ukrainians somewhere near John O’Groats coming the other way. “There is a popular word for people of the Danube who had red hair that comes from this encounter. Those two pieces of historical evidence together with the oral history, are a lovely discovery,” he says.When we think about restoring the lost forests of Scotland, often it’s the native pine forest we imagine. But, had these people not brought the pine with them, we might be looking at a very dferent Scotland, with uplands covered with oak woodland. How does that knowledge, affect what kind of forest we might want to regenerate now Rawlence is keen that we don’t write humans, who, as he says, have co-evolved with trees, out of both nature’s history and its future. “I applaud the rewilding efforts, the efforts to recover nature,” he says. “But it’s worth remembering that humans were always there. And the sustainability of those efforts and those landscapes is going to be contingent upon some kind of human interaction – whether that’s farming, new kinds of wildle tourism, a hunting economy. We have to have a relationship and an entanglement with it. And hopefully these efforts should also be tied to social justice and access for everybody.”He touches on an important debate, in these times of increasing rewilding. We might ask ourselves what the aims of rewilding really are  What are we trying to restore, and in a time when, due to climate change, the conditions are set to change anyway “This is the central tension that I was trying to get to in the chapter on Scotland,” Rawlence says. “Both sides of the rewilding debate are looking back. You’ve got the existing conservation economy saying it was never like that. You’ve got the rewilding utopianism of a kind of pristine boreal forest, which we know by  years ago was already gone in the British Isles. Both of their claims, those dferent claims to the past, are incomplete.”It was his attempt to follow the boreal treeline – the northern line that winds across altitude and latitude and is the limits of where trees will grow – that brought Rawlence to the north of Scotland and the story of the Scots pine. Rawlence, who is not an ecologist, but a former Human Rights Watch researcher and political speechwriter, who has, in Wales, set up an education institution to teach “creative and adaptive thinking” called Black Mountains College. He started to look at this treeline zone when he was on the hunt for a good new subject following his book on Somali refugees, City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World’s Largest Refugee Camp.“The Horn of Africa,” he says, “is a very sensitive area, just like the Arctic. Historically it has had a very stable, very narrow temperature range, with monsoons and very delicate climate patterns which are finely calibrated, which were being disrupted.” What he noticed was that all the “displacement issues, the conflict and the human rights issues” he was covering were connected to and driven by this “underlying change”.“I thought, well, the next thing I want to do is not just go somewhere cold but look at another place where climate change is visible. If we’re going to talk about climate change and we’re going to interrogate what it means, why don’t we go and look at the places where it’s been happening for a long time.”He went in search of a storyline, a way of communicating the enormous topic of climate, something that would enable him to talk about the way we need to “start thinking about our relationship with the non-human world, with other species.”In the treeline he found a story which touched on the lives of indigenous peoples, impacted by climate change, but in which trees were the chief protagonist. For the treeline, he observes, has been on the march. “They’ve been moving since World War One,” he notes.It’s a movement that in many other parts of the world is visible, and noticeable to those who live there. But not here, in Scotland, where, Rawlence says, “you’re not seeing the march because you don’t have the trees. They are gone. There’s only a tiny fraction left. Here in Britain we have been highly successful at annihilating our forest. We’ve got  percent tree cover which is the lowest number in Europe. We have annihilated our ancient woodlands, perhaps more than any other country on earth. Research has shown we are one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world.”Rawlence believes that it’s no coincidence that Britain which “was the driver of the industrial revolution, a pioneer of capitalism, and property rights and enclosure and clearances” has suffered such extraordinary nature depletion. One of the books he cites as having had a profound influence on him, when he read it  years ago, was John Prebble’s The Highland Clearances.“We’ve absolutely written the text book on how to drive nature to the brink in the service of profit. Wales and Scotland and Ireland, are all particularly interesting examples of that. Because the patterns of colonialism and exploitation are written in the landscape.”One of his first chapters revolves around his search for the treeline in Scotland. What’s notable about it is that it seems like the pursuit of some elusive phantom. We have over centuries so stripped our landscape of trees that we no longer know where they might grow, what their limits might be, but nevertheless, Rawlence went hunting for the Cairngorms’ very highest trees.What he was directed to by ecologists, was, he says, not exactly the treeline, but just the place that was the closest approximation to it. “They’ve got a competition going now to see who can geolocate the highest trees in the Cairngorms, amongst the Cairngorms Connect.”In theory, Rawlence says, “Scotland is on the boreal treeline”. We were formerly a “boreal nation” like some of our neighbours. “All of the species in Scotland are continuous with Norway and Russia and it’s exactly the same historical process and exactly the same band of climate niche for those boreal species. But nobody knows where the treeline is because the trees are gone. You don’t see the march.”This means that there’s a sign here that we are not seeing. “When you lose an intact ecosystem, you lose your early warning system. You lose your map of the territory. You lose your guide.”A combination of factors mean that we are not seeing the change. One is that many species are long gone, the other is that, Rawlence describes, we don’t have indigenous communities living so closely with nature as there are in other countries. “They notice for example in Russia that there’s a new grass on the block in the Taiga. They notice that there’s a new butterfly that nobody knows the name for. Whereas in Scotland the most sensitive species to climate change are probably already gone  years ago,  years ago. That’s why we don’t see it. It’s because it’s already gone and we don’t know what we’re looking for and we’ve lost.”Often it’s said that our landscapes are missing key species, the lynx, the wolf, the bear, the beaver, many of these so long gone that it’s hard to imagine the country with them. But it’s also, as Rawlence observes, we are missing humans living closely with the landscape.There are other losses too. We don’t have the kind of indigenous knowledge that Rawlence found in some of the other communities he visited along the treeline. “Our indigenous knowledge is very very lost,” he says. “There are little echoes and tremors and traces of it. But it’s been systematically destroyed through superstition and Christian hegemony for a thousand years. You find it in crackpots and the weirdo books in the funny bookshops. It’s also in the language. It’s in Welsh. It’s in Gaelic.”As we face the prospect of a climate crisis, we might want to dig deeper into the past. Knowing the factors that made that past unfold as it did, he says, is vital. “If you understand better the contingency of the past, then the future becomes mutable. It becomes possible. It becomes something you can change, rather than this horrible place of powerlessness and denial where the only response to climate change is to run away or to bury your head in the sand, or be cynical.”Meanwhile, the treeline remains elusive in Scotland. Is it here, or is it not  Might we, through regeneration, find where it should be  “What’s exciting about Scotland is thatyou take the overgrazing out of the picture then you’ll see what’s going to happen and where the treeline is. It might be already above the top of the mountains.” A key aim of Cairngorms Connect is to allow trees to re-establish up to the natural treeline.Perhaps, he even suggests the whole of the Cairngorms were once entirely covered with forest. Cairn gorm is Gaelic for ‘blue mountains’, and he theorises perhaps this is because of the blue-green of the pines.One of the messages of The Treeline is that we are going to have to soon face a future where the climate is dferent. For Rawlence is fairly sure that we are on that trajectory towards  degrees, not the . degrees that was the fragile goal of COP.“- percent of scientists agree that . degrees is impossible,” he says. “When I started this research  years ago, it might have been argued that . degrees was in reach, but there’s now the reality of physics to contend with. And the other reality which has been a feature in my le is the reality of politics and I just know that the system is not going to sht that fast. So evenphysically it was possible, politically I know the hard limits of where we are and I despair of the ability to sht.”Rawlence’s despair at politics partly comes from his experience of working within it. In the run up to the Iraq war, he was a speechwriter for Charles Kennedy and lead for the Liberal Democrats for the campaign against that war.: Rewild Scotland: \"Beavers in all rivers. Lynx and wolf back.”“I used to wake up,” he recalls, “with nightmares about Tony Blair, frustrated with the fact we could win the argument and popular opinion, and yet with oil and the US and [President] Bush it’s happening and there’s nothing you can do. I had a very visceral experience of the unresponsiveness of the democratic system. I saw how fossil capital was hardwired into the system. Not just fossil capital but capital more broadly, and that you cannot extricate capital from its principal energy source. Without fossil fuels it doesn’t work.”He places little hope in the processes of international summits like COP. He calls the over-focussing on emissions “carbon reductionism” and dismisses net zero as a “dangerous delusion”.“I think hopefully what the book shows you is that nature is really complicated, that carbon is a system that’s in flux all the time, with enormous volatility. If you want to use the econometric metaphor like net zero, then you have to acknowledge that this is  accounting.”Nature, he says, is “supremely complicated”. It’s those communities he features in the books who live closely with it that understand it best.Rawlence has uncovered a fascinating story about the history of the Scots pine in Scotland, but what about its future  There, what he has found is not nearly so lovely.

Port offices will also revert to normal opening hours.But it confirmed that the Mallaig to Lochboisdale service will remain cancelled due to \"vessel availability\" being impacted by \"emergent steelwork repairs\" on the -year-old MV Caledonian Isles discovered while it was undergoing an overhaul.As a result, CalMac said it cannot release MV Hebridean Isles to cover the Oban-Lochboisdale sailing.   CalMac said that MV Isle of Arran is currently berthed in Campbeltown and is not operational due to a lack of crew.Therefore, the ferry operator said it was not able to deploy her on the Oban to Mull route which would, in turn, have released the MV Isle of Mull to operate the leline service for South Uist.\"We are continuing to review the crewing situation with MV Isle of Arran and will look to deploy her once the crewing situation further improves,\" said CalMac.CalMac managing director Robbie Drummond said: “I am pleased to say that because of a signicant drop in the number of staff unable to work due to covid we can now offer a full winter service on the majority of routes.“Thank you to all passengers for their patience and understanding and we look forward to welcoming them back on board.”The Oban to Lochboisdale service was the only one to be suspended for the duration of the timetable in response to staff self-isolating due to Covid.Stòras Uibhist a community owned company that manages the , acre South Uist Estate comprising the Outer Hebridean islands of Eriskay, South Uist and parts of Benbecula questioned why the Lochboisdale service was the only one to be suspended.It has written to the Scottish government asking why the Lochboisdale service was the only one across the entire CalMac fleet to be suspended.The group said: \"This is clear evidence that our service is treated as dispensable and demonstrates a complete lack of care and respect to our community.\"CalMac has said that alternative services are available via a detour to Lochmaddy on North Uist.South Uist residents say it has added six hours to the travelling time of atrip to Glasgow as ferry users have to ert to get the ferry from North Uist and travel to Skye."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13410475.jpg?type=article-full","title":"unions-call-nicola-sturgeon-intervention-ensure-scotland-properly-gains-scotwind","story":"The Scottish Trades Union Congresshas written to the First Minister ahead of their biannual meeting on Thursday calling for increased government intervention to secure direct and supply chain jobs and to ensure more of the profits stay in the country following the announcement of ScotWind leasing project last week.Seventeen ScotWind projects, with a combined potential generating capacity of GW, have been offered new rights to specic areas of the seabed for the development of offshore wind power.The Herald on Sunday revealed that the nation is set to lose billions in profits every years from the new round of offshore wind projects hailed by the First Minister as a \"truly historic\" opportunity for Scotlands net zero economy.There is concern that a failure to create a state-owned energy company which could have sold the new ScotWind electricity to the grid and retained operating profits, has led to concerns that the nation will lose between £. billion and £. billion every year - about a tenth of the current Scottish budget.: ScotWind: Scotland set to lose billions in windfarm profitsThe respected think tank Common Weal said it is \"arguably the greatest economic failure of the last decade\".The STUC, which has  affiliated unions, said that as things stand development over the next decade is set to be dominated by the private sector and overseas companies, but they argue that government has a vital role to play in directly developing capacity, investing in infrastructure and skills and convincing developers to make good on supply chain promises.It said that ministers should think again about setting up a Scottish National Energy Company, to participate in developing and deploying new offshore wind farms.The STUC has provided analysis showing that as many as , jobs could be created with the right interventions in place, but as few as ,they are not. Critical to this is the creation of a fabrication supply chain.As a first step, the STUC asks the First Minister to convene a major summit of successful bidders to begin the process of planning for a supply chain revolution in Scotland.Scotland gains from the Crown Estates Scotland auction of the seabed plots around the Scottish coast, netting a one-off £m. Its profits are given to the Scottish Treasury or split between some local authorities.Based on proposed project rents outlined by seabed managers Crown Estates Scotland, it was revealed that the ScotWind projects operating at its full capacity would be estimated to bring Scotland between £m and £m each year - a tiny fraction of the billions expected in profits.While the total impact on the associated supply chain and on the number of jobs created will not be known until later in the process, the First Minister said their estimates suggest as much as £ billion could be generated for every gigawatt of power. A gigawatt equates to roughly two coal-fired power plants and is enough to power , homes in Britain.Some believe the Scottish supply chain spin off is an “overpromise” with current bids currently excluding any firm commitments.Scottish energy secretary Michael Matheson last week failed to answer whether there would be any specic, binding commitments for winning bidders to deliver investment and jobs in Scotland, after being urged to make sure the benefits are not “squandered”.STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said: “Rarely has the phrase, ‘we wouldn’t have started from here,’ been more relevant than it is for the ScotWind leasing round. We should not be reliant on overseas private companies to deliver the jobs we need. More profits should be coming to Scotland to be invested in our future.“However, it is not too late for government to intervene through ownership, investment and conditionality.“We heard plenty of encouraging noises from corporations in the run up to the ScotWind announcement, now we begin the process of turning those promises into reality.”The Common Weal think tank says that a lack of manufacturing capacity in Scotland means that supply chain promises may not be forthcomingcompanies believe it is cheaper to import material rather than invest in Scotland.Last year the Herald on Sunday revealed that Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Scottish Governments economic development agency faced the loss of up to £.m of taxpayers money through the collapse of offshore wind tower firm CS Wind, the only UK facility for manufacturing onshore and offshore wind towers and seen as a key part of Scotlands green revolution.Common Weal has long advocated the establishment of a state-owned company which would have owned energy resources, to provide secure, reliable and low-cost retail energy to households and to ensure there were renewable energy supply chain and manufacturing jobs for Scotland.Nicola Sturgeon said in  that the Scottish Government planned to set up a state-owned energy company in Scotland which was due to be established last year but was dropped in September."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmNew legislation on the licensing of short term lets that could regulated the bed and breakfast market has come under fire, amid concerns over the impact this might have on small enterprises.

The money is invested in accredited offsetting schemes, certied to the highest international standards of Loganair’s net zero plan. These schemes include the Albano Machado and Rio dos Índios projects and the Tambopata-Bahuaja bioersity reserve in Peru.However, Loganair recognises the importance of supporting local communities on their own path to carbon zero, which is facilitated via the GreenSkies Community fund.The fund will be released in three instalments of £,, with applicants able to access a maximum grant of £, per project. The application deadline for the first instalment is st January, .The initiative is open to communities and will help to establish renewable energy projects such as small-scale wind systems, solar , small-scale hydro power, and air source heat pumps. It is not available for funding research or feasibility studies.Jonathan Hinkles, CEO, Loganair, said: “We’ve made our position clear. The transport industry as a whole has a duty to address and reduce emissions from every form of travel, and it’s our responsibility as the UK’s largest regional airline to lead the way.“Our GreenSkies Community Fund will support local renewables projects that not only tackle carbon emissions but also benefit communities by providing power that reduces energy bills. As an airline we are involved in some incredibly exciting and innovative initiatives to decarbonise aviation and we hope our GreenSkies Community Fund will encourage the same pioneering spirit in communities across Scotland.”Readers are reminded that the GreenSkies Community Fund is now open, should you have a project you wish to apply for, but the deadline for the first instalment is approaching soon.

He’s seeing the best of the best,” Gloucester head coach George Skivington said.“He’s had a niggle for a little while and it kept him out of one game a few weeks ago. It’s just been chipping away and it got to a point where it wasn’t great, so we decided to get it investigated.“Once we know exactly what the story is we’ll have a better idea about the injury. It would have been one incident a few weeks ago, but he’s been managing his way through it, as generally speaking senior players do, and it just got a little too much.“The hope is that he will still play in the Six Nations. If he can back involved in the Six Nations then great. It’s unfortunate for Jonny because we’d like to see him playing for England.“There aren’t too many who will nail their rehab like Jonny. He’s on it every day anyway when he’s fully fit, doing all his pre-hab. When he comes back I’m sure he’ll be absolutely flying.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642778651871.jpg--covid_19___fri_21st_january_figures.jpg?1642778651000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220121newscovid 19 fri 21st january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

However Mr Kingston, its group leader on the council, said they would support flying the flag on July  to mark the Somme anniversary, or a day to mark the NHS – a suggestion put forward by Alliance.Andrew’s birthday is part of a list of designated days when the government advises the Union flag to be flown at council buildings.Although the decision is still to be ratied by the full council, Mr Beattie said a decision not to raise the flag would be the right one.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBrexit...UUP leader Doug Beattie during a press conference at Stormont.

Nobody is saying that you’re guilty. Innocent until proven guilty remains fundamental, but it shouldn’t fly.”Mr Kingston said much of the DUP’s concern had been over the lack of information received by his party ahead of last Friday’s meeting.“The DUP’s position remains that we want the Union flag to fly every day in Belfast as it does for the majority of councils across the UK,” he said.“Sinn Fein and the SDLP are only using this issue to remove another flag day. Our concern is that next year this day will be dropped all together. We do need clarity on the details. Will this be a one-off  Will there be support for that on a permanent basis ”Mr Kingston said that assurances were still needed on an alternative date.“We would support July  to mark the Battle of the Somme, or a day to mark the NHS,” he said.“That is our position. Regrettably, for all the talk of working together, the SDLP did not have the courtesy to communicate with us in advance of the committee meeting last Friday to seek an agreed way forward.“We share concerns about the seriousness of the allegations of misconduct by Prince Andrew.”SDLP councillor Donal Lyons welcomed what he described as a “DUP u-turn” and said he was glad common sense had prevailed on the issue.“The DUP’s belated change of stance in this is welcome, as is the support for this move from the UUP,” he said.Despite claims by the DUP that they were blindsided by my proposal, we were open and transparent from the start, I made this proposal in advance of last week’s council meeting, including my offer to work with unionist councillors to find an alternative day to fly the flag.”On the Alliance Party proposal, councillor Nuala McAllister said there was little time for council to raty any decision had it not been brought forward in the committee meeting.“Had this been brought forward at council we would have had to wait until March for it to be ratied and that would have been too late,” she said.“We have followed proper process, but this is a non-argument. We’re all on the same page. It is council’s responsibility to reflect the feeling in society,” she added.“There are serious questions around his judgment.”She added: “The Alliance Party has said that the flag should fly on an alternative date We are not trying to stoke any fires.”Related topicsDoug BeattieBelfast City CouncilMore On Doug Beattie PremiumMark BainOpinionFor a torturous hour, Doug Beattie faced the music PremiumAlex KaneOpinionWho is the real Doug Beattie Doug Beattie’s tweets: What he said then and his explanations now PremiumEimear McGovernOpinionTweet has undone some of Doug Beattie’s good worksDoug Beattie admits he was ‘on cusp’ of resigning, as ‘broken’ leader to meet with UUP to decide future over tweetsMost ReadFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normal#Ashamed and embarrassed#: UUP leader Doug Beattie apologises for historic tweetsDUP shts stance on flying Union flag for Prince Andrew’s birthdayI’ve finally found love again, reveals NI granddaughter of film legend Charlie ChaplinTop VideosPlayJoe Biden calls reporter a #stupid son of a b****#PlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s wePlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguageLatest PoliticsEdwin Poots issues defamation proceedings against Doug Beattie and Tory MP Simon Hoare over offensive tweet about his we‘Solutions needed’ for hospital waiting list crisisAlex KaneOpinionWho is the real Doug Beattie Senior civil servant Sue Gray probing Tories ‘faced down IRA hijack bid’Eimear McGovernOpinionTweet has undone some of Doug Beattie’s good worksLatestHonorary vice president of Magic Circle receives MBE at Stranded drivers freed in Istanbul and Athens after snowstormEngland wing Jonny May to miss at least opening two rounds of Six NationsDon’t put yourselves at risk over Russia exercises plan, Irish fishermen toldMarcus Rashford reinforces opposition to antisemitism after photo with Wiley,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Newry, with  cases, was in fourth place ahead of Derry .Downpatrickrsquos total of  cases mdash which placed the area in seventh place in the table ndash was  less thanNewtownards and seven more than Newtownabbey.The publication of the latest Covid figures came after Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Sir Michael McBride, issued a fresh call for pregnant women to get vaccinated.The warning comes as the spread of the Omicron iant continues to cause high case numbers in Northern Ireland with Sir Michael explaining that a recent study provides more evidence that having Covid- during pregnancy carries a far higher risk than having the vaccine, particularly in the later stages where it can have serious consequences for both mother and baby.ldquoCovid- vaccination is crucial in protecting women and babies from the le-threatening complications that can be associated with the virus, said the chief medical officer.ldquoldquoAnyone who is pregnant and has not received all of their vaccinations should not put off getting vaccinated until after their pregnancy.In addition to Sir Michael, a labour ward sister at the Ulster Hospital mdash managed by the South Eastern Trust mdash also urged all expectant mums to come forward to receive their Covid- vaccinations in light of a the study from the University of Edinburgh which found that women who get Covid- towards the end of their pregnancy are at an increased risk of birth-related complications.The study findings reveal that preterm births, stillbirths and newborn deaths are more common among women who have the virus  days, or less, before their delivery date.In addition, the study also provided further reassurance on the safety of vaccination during pregnancy.Sister Kate McGarrigle said it was crucial for all women to come forward and receive their Covid vaccination, especially in light of the highly transmissible Omicron iant.ldquoIf you do not receive your vaccine, you are at risk of becoming seriously unwell, she warned.ldquoReceiving the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and your unborn baby. It is understandable that there are concerns around receiving the vaccine. Please do come forward and speak to your midwe or obstetrician and get information to allow you to make a decision.Vaccination clinics for first and second dose and booster jab vaccinations are

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history. He also met a number of residents at the community centre before visiting Rowallane Garden for a guided tour.Mr Moffett concluded the first day of his visit with a visit to the Belfast Road community centre to view the new facility and was impressed at the potential of fitting out the remaining empty buildings which would include a heritage area to complement the planned windmill park.Mr Moffett, who also played a round of golf at Royal County Down and visited the Mournes, said the beauty of Co Down, with its unique visitor sites and the central location of Saintfield, reinforced in his mind the importance of the windmill park project and the heritage centre.The third and final day of his visit was spent at a local shop exploring the location of his familyrsquos th century farm in Leggygowan.Mr Moffett said: ldquoExploring my family history was a wonderful way to end my visit to Saintfield. I look forward to ing soon and continuing to work on our shared interest in completing the windmill park project and heritage centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19January2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Speed sign reinstated in Saintfield in bid to halt speeding drivers  ","story":"WORK has started to reinstate an electronic speed indicator sign at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield.The sign mdash one of a number erected across the district by the arearsquos Policing and Community Partnership mdash was removed last year after concerns were expressed about its original location at the busy road.Designed to put the brakes on speeders, the signs have proved effective in a number of locations with plans to install more of them over the coming months.The reinstatement of the Saintfield sign has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who said that it will make drivers more aware of their speed at this busy road.A decision to relocate the Saintfield sign was agreed by a sub-committee of the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.Cllr Owen said she was delighted that the speed sign was being erected as it will remind drivers of their speed as they approach the built-up town centre area.Cllr Owen also thanked residents who helped her lobby for the reinstatement of the speed indicator sign following its removal.The Ballynahinch Road is one of the districtrsquos speeding hot spots with a number of high speeds recorded by the previous speed indicator sign located in a mph zone. It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %.

I just mentioned I was fond of a cream bun on air one day and it just stuck.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Mondays to Fridays, from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"covid  ni takes further step away from restrictions as rules change again ","story":"Protestants should not say sorry for abuse in Catholic establishments   Doug Beattie says sorry for Edwin Poots brothel ‘joke’NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPoliticsCovid-: NI takes further step away from restrictions as rules change againTomorrow will mark another step forward in the reopening of Northern Ireland as the ban on nightclubs is lted, and Covid passes are dispensed with by hospitality businesses.By Niall DeeneyTuesday, th January , : am  \"       \"  A barman in a Belfast pub ahead of a change to the rules around Covid certicationA series of restrictions will be lted tomorrow as part of what Health Minister Robin Swann has suggested could be the “beginning of the end” of the coronavirus pandemic here.The latest changes were agreed in a meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive on Thursday, and follow an earlier loosening of the rules on Friday.From January , the requirement to be seated whilst consuming food and or drink and for table service in premises that provide alcohol was removed, along with limit of six people at a table from dferent households.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

While that requirement will go, guidance remains in place that risk assessments should be carried out.Some of the few restrictions remaining in place after tomorrow will be the requirement to wear face coverings in public settings indoors, the legal duty on retailers to take “reasonable measures to reduce the risk of transmission”, along with the requirement for risk assessments to be carried out in certain settings.Contact tracing requirements – including the need for certain settings to record visitor information – will also remain in place after tomorrow.Guidance on testing, including the expectation that those working in certain sectors are tested regularly, will also remain in place after tomorrow.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast year because we were in deep lockdown it never happened and because of the current Covid rules it had to be postponed again, which is probably why only three walkers came out to meet him at the Knap car terrace in perfect walking weather, on a bright and crisp morning to join in a -mile replacement walk.On the hillside just above them are the neat foundations of a Roman Building which contained  rooms all grouped around a courtyard with the building being dated to the late rd century AD by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. It seems a natural harbour was to be found to the east of this area and one theory is that this was a guesthouse connected with naval activity at the harbour as no evidence of a water supply or baths common in villa’s could be found. In the early ’s the trust carried out excavations on site and pieces of Roman pottery and tiles were found and a public viewing  now overlooks the site.They soon warmed up due to a short but stf climb onto the clftop and followed a narrow path through woodland to descend the Golden Stairs into Porthkerry Country Park, where the frost covered board walk led them towards the ft Porthkerry Viaduct. Deviating off the cycle path at Robin’s Walk brought them into muddy fields beside the Whitelands Brook for the climb up to join the A opposite Welford and along the verge to cross a stile leading into fields behind Blackton Farm.A well-worn farm track led to the road for the journey to Penmark Village where they entered the churchyard of St Mary’s for their mid-morning refreshments, utilising the steps on the preaching cross as seating whilst enjoying the warm sunshine. The church dates to the th century being mentioned for the first time in  and a few centuries later the tower was added, but most of its medieval traits were lost when it was renovated during the Victorian era..removeThey continued and joined part of the long distance Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail, through fields on the boundary of Cardf Airport making towards Fonmon with its lovely duck pond and stunning weeping willow tree which cascades over the water. Then climbing steps into a small wood leading to muddy fields near Home Farm they eventually exited onto Port Road following it southwards to East Aberthaw.Taking time out they paused at the Blue Anchor for a swt pint outside in the fresh air before following Well Road downhill. This road was previously known as Marshe Way, one would presume because the River Thaw flowed to reach the sea by this route until the Aberthaw Power Station was built and the river was re-routed.Tramping muddy paths below the main Vale railway line through the nature reserve which is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, they headed through the reed beds beside the western end of the delightful lake, overseen by the ruined Aberthaw Limeworks built in , to arrive at the sea defence wall. Heading out onto the beach they found a suitable place for lunch sitting on a washed up tree trunk beside the dunes and overlooking the Bristol Channel and English coastline before continuing along the salt flats.The beautul refurbished clf steps on part of the Wales Coast Path brought them steeply uphill into Fontygary Leisure Park, which was eerily quiet due to the winter months and reaching Fontygary beach, they continued up steps following the coast path past the old disused limestone quarries to reach the southernmost tip of mainland Wales and Rhoose Point. Onward through Porthkerry Holiday Park and the Iron Age hillfort at the Bulwarks, to slither downhill through the woods back into Porthkerry for the steep climb back up the Golden Stairs in order to make their way along the clftop to Cold Knap, just as the sun was sinking in the western sky.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

If things continue to improve then there would be an active debate on whether the covid pass is still a proportionate part of the measure that we want to have in place.\"Well keep doing what we always do - well look at the measures, well ask for advice on whether the covid pass is still part of our defences andthe answer is yes well continue with it.\"If things have improved to the point when its no longer part of necessary measures then well respond to that advice as well.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers – despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniog’s  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers.

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers – despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniog’s  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church – which had a well named after Dwynwen – can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD.
