Groovy baby!When the clerks of Camden’s highways department were issuing parking fines from their gloomy office in the 1970s, little can they have imagined that jet-setting hipsters would one day be supping cocktails in the public library below them before taking an al fresco dip up on the roof. Maligned for years as the concrete “egg box” of Euston Road, the old council headquarters have been reborn as the glamorous Standard Hotel, the first outpost of the risque boutique chain outside the US.“People thought we were crazy to suggest open-air bathtubs in London,” says Shawn Hausman, the Los Angeles-based designer behind the Standard’s flamboyant interiors, who started out creating film sets for Saturday Night Fever. “But I think it’s always nice to have a bath outside, even in the rain.”Naked bodies bobbing above the rooftops is par for the course for a chain with a reputation for racy touches. Its first hotel, which opened on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood in 1999, features live models in a vitrine behind the reception desk, part of an art installation called The Box. Its New York flagship, which straddles the High Line park, takes voyeurism to the next level via the celebrity-frequented Boom Boom Room, an exclusive club that boasts four sitdown toilets in a single cubicle.Then there are its full-height bedroom windows, which have given the hotel a reputation as a site of sexual exhibitionism (encouraged by raunchy scenes in Steve McQueen’s film Shame being shot there). The price of a room is listed on the restaurant’s dessert menu, and where other hotels put the Gideon Bible, here you’ll find condoms and ibuprofen. Is this what’s in store for what was, until recently, a bastion of council bureaucracy? Built in 1977 by Camden’s esteemed in-house architects’ department, the town hall annexe had long been seen as a concrete carbuncle. It was listed in the local conservation area plan as making a “negative contribution”, its rough pre-cast facade looming across the road from George Gilbert Scott’s gothic fantasy of St Pancras station like a cheese-grater.When Scott’s creation was reborn as luxury apartments and a swanky hotel in 2011, it was only a matter of time before Camden cashed in on the location and architectural heritage of its own offices. Such muscular works of brutalism were rapidly becoming the subject of coffee-table books and tea towels – and being eyed up by trendy hotel chains looking to make a statement.Facing hefty repair bills for lifts and services, the council sold the leaky hulk in 2014 for almost £60m, transferring its offices to a new block just to the north, saving an estimated £500,000 a year. For the Standard, which had been scouting in London for a decade, it was the perfect fit. “We thought all we needed to do was put a logo on it,” says managing director Bruce Robertson.The reality wasn’t so simple. To make the project viable, a three-storey “crown” has been added, supported by threading new steel columns through the existing structure, whose facade has been scrubbed a gleaming white, while the brown-tinted windows have been replaced with clear curved glazing specially manufactured by a boatbuilding company. Orms architects have made it look as good as new, finishing it off with a jaunty red bubble lift so guests can feel like they’re being shuttled up the facade in a flying phone box.This flash of glossy red is a hint of what lies within. Anyone who remembers queueing up inside the council’s concrete colossus to sort out their housing benefit won’t recognise the place. Working with interior architects Archer Humphryes, Hausman’s team has conjured a surreal vision of swinging London: a souped-up Austin Powers world of enamel optical-art murals and moulded ceramic wall features, with a hoard of vintage furniture sourced from the jazziest corners of eBay.“We were inspired by a range of movies, from Fahrenheit 451 to Silent Running and Logan’s Run,” says Hausman, “as well as the iconic aesthetics of the London Underground. Mid-century Italian design played a big part too.”A reception desk striped with exotic hardwoods stands in front of a bulging blue and red ceramic wall by Lubna Chowdhary, recalling the Paolozzi mosaics at Tottenham Court Road station, while a chunky pink terrazzo floor leads visitors through to what was once St Pancras public library. It is now a lounge bar themed around an imagined 1970s library, complete with an in-house librarian who will curate a selection of “radical” books.“The original library was not so aesthetically pleasing,” says Hausman, “so we’ve invented the kind we would have liked to find here.” It is evidently the fictional library of a design aficionado: alongside retro veneered bookshelves are collectible pieces of Memphis furniture, baggy leather Saporiti sofas, and a ceiling dotted with red globe fixtures. To one side stands a “sounds lounge” recording booth, where musicians and DJs will make podcasts and record interviews, while around the corner lies the first of several restaurants, complete with a “fermentation bar”.The interiors exude the retro charm of a Wes Anderson film set, but there is something unsavoury about a place once designed for public services being co-opted as a luxury lifestyle destination. It’s like Hackney’s former Asian Women’s Advisory Service being crassly reborn as The Advisory hipster burger bar. At least in this case, St Pancras library has a bright new home in the Kings Cross development, where a new public swimming pool and leisure centre have also been provided beneath the new council offices – an amenity the hotel itself lacks.The Standard claims its ground floor will be as “democratic” as possible, with a e bar-style venue spilling on to a passage, and a new public garden to the south where a closed route has been opened up. It was the only bidder for the site that proposed keeping the building – others planned to raze it in favour of a tower. When brutalist gems like the nearby Welbeck Street car park are being demolished to make way for lumpen new hotels, the vision to reuse such a massive concrete edifice should be applauded.The bedrooms – which range from £150 to over £1,000 per night – continue the transport theme, with the curved windows recalling those of a ferry, along with tightly pleated train-style curtains and bold geometric bedspreads by Wallace \u0026amp Sewell (fabric designers for Transport for London) complementing window seats in burgundy Harris tweed. Suspended ceilings have been ripped out to reveal the concrete waffle-slabs, while the open-plan bathrooms are an on-trend Pinterest board come alive, with riotous symphonies of bubblegum pink and navy blue tiles punctuated by mint taps.Others aren’t as appealing. Across the boldly-carpeted corridors – designed as “an archaeological dig of 1970s patterns” – lie what are being marketed as “Cosy Core” rooms, a euphemism for windowless bunkers. It is here that the challenges of converting a deep-plan office into a functioning hotel are most sorely felt – a substantial block of rooms in the centre won’t enjoy a chink of daylight.“It would be illegal in the US,” Hausman admits, “but here it was a great opportunity to exceed expectations of what a windowless room could be.” Aimed at jet-lagged travellers and nocturnal party animals, the rooms have a loungey hungover vibe, with low corner-sofas that meld into the beds, and long wood-floored showers filled with plastic plants in the hope of distracting guests from their light-starved existence.The heady climax, which won’t open until later in the year, is found at the top of the crown, where one side will be a Latin-themed restaurant run by a double-Michelin-starred chef, imagined as a 1970s tropical plant-strewn lair of macramé curtains, rattan ceiling panels and raised terraces of crazy paving.On the other side will be an opulent 24-hour-licensed venue with faceted mirror ceilings, leather banquettes and what the designers describe as a “big, boisterous, spectacular curtain”, drawn back to reveal five-metre high curved windows looking out over King’s Cross – London’s very own version of New York’s Boom Boom Room.Longtime local residents will be astonished that such a thing could ever appear on the Euston Road, but it completes the rapid mutation of this once-seedy district  into London’s gilded “gateway to Europe”, where the likes of Google, LVMH and Universal Music rub shoulders with one of the country’s best art schools, Central Saint Martin’s – and where rooftop bathers will now be able to wave across to hedge fund managers living in the former railway offices of St Pancras.

But now a portrait of one of history’s most formidable women by one of the world’s greatest painters has been rediscovered – and it will go under the hammer next month.The Portrait of Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj, painted in the mid-17th century by the Spanish master Diego Velázquez, has undergone painstaking authentication and conservation by Sotheby’s since it was brought to the auction house’s Amsterdam office 18 months ago.With an estimated price of £2m-£3m, it could be bought by either a private collector or a world-class museum. “Velázquez is one of the absolute stand-out titans of European and world painting. This portrait is unquestionably of interest to scholars and admirers of Velázquez alike,” said James Macdonald, Sotheby’s senior specialist in Old Master paintings.It is also a rare depiction of the most influential, avaricious and manipulative woman in 17th-century Rome. Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj was the power behind the papal throne, and the reputed lover as well as sister-in-law of Pope Innocent X. Nicknamed Papessa – the lady pope – Donna Olimpia was an ardent feminist, championing Rome’s prostitutes and nuns alike.She was a “baroque rock star”, according to Eleanor Herman, author of Mistress of the Vatican: the True Story of Olimpia Maidalchini. “Women from all over the Catholic world came to Rome to station themselves outside her palace and cheer as her carriage rolled out.“They could not believe that a female from modest beginnings had risen to such heights, running the nation of the Papal States and the Catholic church, an institution where women were not – and still are not – allowed any power at all.”Donna Olimpia determined foreign policy and chose cardinals. Kings and queens across Europe sent gifts of gold and diamonds to curry favour. No decision was taken by Pope Innocent before consulting his sister-in-law. “People in Rome hung banners over the pope’s name on public buildings that read Pope Olimpia I. Medals were minted showing her wearing the papal tiara and sitting on the throne of St Peter,” said Herman.But the men of the papal court despised and feared her. One cardinal deplored the “monstrous power of a woman in the Vatican”. Another contemporary said that never before had a pope allowed himself to be “so absolutely governed by a woman”. Another cardinal said that the government of Rome was “in the hands of a whore”.Roman artists, musicians, playwrights and sculptors enjoyed her patronage. She was behind the commissioning of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the extravagant fountain in the Piazza Navona that is today a major tourist attraction.“She was a woman of fierce passions, keen intelligence and great charm, who protected weaker women against the injustices of men. She was also greedy, calculating and at times chillingly cold,” said Herman. Soon after her death from bubonic plague in 1657, the Catholic church “moved to eradicate the scandalous memory of this audacious woman who had ruled them all”.Several years earlier, Velázquez had made his second trip to Rome, during which Donna Olimpia sat for the master. “Her character was captured in this portrait – you can see she was a pretty stern inidual,” said Macdonald.Ownership of the portrait – a companion to Velázquez’s Cardinal Camillo Massimi, which now hangs at Kingston Lacy, a National Trust house in Dorset – was meticulously documented until 1724. “Then the trace went cold,” said Macdonald.Now it is known that the painting ended up in the Netherlands, where in the 1980s it was offered at auction as the work of “anonymous, Dutch school”. It was bought by a private collector, who bequeathed it to its present owner.Sotheby’s showed the painting to Velázquez experts in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Macdonald recalled: “Bit by bit, the jigsaw fell into place. It was incredibly exciting. Everyone who saw it was amazed that this picture, long deemed lost and thought probably to have been destroyed, had actually risen from the ashes.”The painting will be offered at a Sotheby’s sale of Old Masters in London on 3 July, alongside works by Gainsborough, Constable, Turner, Rubens, Botticelli and Brueghel, collectively estimated to be worth up to £66m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac13b87fd2f8c8bcf786b67edfc9c533da8093dc/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9500c4659de6b3bf6d0d696c6d4783da","title":"yorkshire sculpture international festival hopes to be a force for change","story":"Event arguably makes Leeds and Wakefield area best place in Europe to see sculpture“When we started here, no one thought it was a good idea,” says Peter Murray, the director of Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP), as he sits in the cafe that overlooks the rolling 202-hectare (500-acre) estate that opened to the public in 1977.Back then politicians weren’t interested, local residents and businesses didn’t understand it and the only people in favour seemed to be artists, says Murray. “In the early days there was the constant battling and fighting for funds. Then there’s the politics of the art world and the politics of regional and national government.

There’s a Damien Hirst statue in the middle of Briggate, the main shopping street in Leeds. Down the road there’s new work by Rashid Johnson and Cauleen Smith.Five Yorkshire-based sculptors are being supported throughout the 100-day event. The official line is that the Rhubarb Triangle has become the Sculpture Triangle with Leeds Art Gallery, the Henry Moore Institute and the award-winning the Hepworth Wakefield making this area of West Yorkshire arguably the best place in Europe to see sculpture.Murray is hopeful the event will help to further the area’s credentials as an arts mainstay. He uses the German city of Kassel as an example of a place transformed by hosting the Documenta international arts event. There was controversy in Kassel last year over Olu Oguibe’s 50ft (15-metre) obelisk, which the words “I was a stranger and you took me in” written on it in Turkish, Arabic, German, and English. The city was proposing to buy the sculpture to keep permanently, but there were protests by far-right politicians before it eventually returned to the city. In the febrile Brexit atmosphere any use of public space or money can become similarly politicised.Brian Alexander is looking up at Huma Bhabha’s Receiver, a green and black humanoid figure that stands between the city’s county hall, its police headquarters and a statute of Queen Victoria. “If you want people from Wakefield to be onside, this is an old-fashioned mining community and this doesn’t wash,” he says. “This is the civic centre of the town and I think you need something more … civic.”Alexander shows me a Facebook exchange he had the night before with a young woman who said she was happy about YSI coming to the area. He disagreed with her and thinks the average Wakefield resident would question the need for the event when the city has lost £171m of council budget cuts over eight years. “People don’t have the right idea,” he says. “They’re saying ‘why has the council spent so much money on that? The money could be spent better on something we need more’.”Funding for the festival comes in the form of a £750,000 grant from the Arts Council, which covers around half of the cost. The other half comes from partners including Wakefield council, 2023 Leeds, the University of Leeds and more than a dozen others.Godfrey Worsdale, the director of the Henry Moore Foundation, says there would be collective disappointment if fewer than a million visitors saw YSI, and he wants local residents to make up a large portion of attendees. “People in Yorkshire have got to be involved,” he says. “It needs to be internationally ambitious and locally relevant, and sculpture feels like something everyone can get around.”“It makes me think that with this place we need to redouble our efforts and fuck the notion of coming up with lowest common denominator to please lots of people. You need to keep it international to keep people’s minds and imaginations open.”Wallis’s uncompromising approach could be informed by the fact he has had to face and overcome pessimism before the Hepworth Wakefield opened in 2011. “I arrived in 2008 and the financial crash was happening and people were saying ‘no one will ever come’,” he says. “Now we have 250,000 visitors a year and a third of them are from the local area.”Wallis sees a potential positive for the arts in West Yorkshire after the current political situation calms – a move to a more devolved system. “One of the good things that could come out of this is the notion of a devolution outside of London, and that these world class and challenging experiences could be there for everyone,” he says. “You don’t have to water something down just because it’s in the regions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96b6733074c94a053a9087dcb4ce942fa22287d/0_0_2332_1555/master/2332.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=de34666b614311923d8af5faf8815a1c 1400w","title":"on chapel sands laura cumming extract memoir mother","story":"In an exclusive extract, the Observer’s art critic tells the remarkable story of how her mother was abducted as a child – and how it was covered upThis is how it began, and how it would end, on the long pale strand of a Lincolnshire beach in the last hour of sun, the daylight moon small as a kite in the sky. Far below, a child of three was playing by herself with a new tin spade. It was still strangely warm in that autumn of 1929, and she had taken off her plimsolls to feel the day’s heat lingering in the sand beneath her feet. Short fair hair, no coat, blue eyes and dress to match: that was the description later given to the police. She had come out of the house that afternoon and along the short path to the beach with her mother, Mrs Veda Elston. They had already been there for some time, with biscuits in an old tartan tin, digging and sieving the sand. The tide was receding when they arrived, the concussion of waves on the shore gradually quietening as the day wore on by now the sea was almost half a mile in the distance. In this lull, on their own familiar beach, and so comfortingly close to home, Veda must have let her daughter wander free for a moment. For she did not see what happened next.Someone moved swiftly across the beach and began talking to the little girl. Someone she perhaps knew, because no sounds were heard as they coaxed her away. One minute she was there, barefoot and absorbed, spade in hand, seconds later she was taken off the sands at the village of Chapel St Leonards apparently without anybody noticing at all. Thus was my mother kidnapped.I see the scene again and again, always trying to grasp the unfathomable moment in which she vanished and everything changed. The place where she was playing empties into air the tide freezes the beach turns blank. Time stands still on the shore. How many minutes before her absence begins to register, before Veda becomes uneasy and then fearful, before the silence is broken by shouting and rushing to the spot where the spade lies fallen? The waves continue their impervious lapping, gulls drifting on the surface as the afternoon fades. How long before anybody missed my mother?I have the police report of that day. It is scant. Mrs Elston takes her daughter to the beach at or around 2.30pm. Approximately two hours later, the child disappears so fast that she couldn’t have got anywhere near the water. Unable to find her on the sands, Mrs Elston retraces their steps, searching the path and even the house in case she might have found her way home. Neighbours help look for the child. An urgent telegram is sent to the father, who is away for work, summoning him back to Chapel.All of this is duly reported to the police, but not until the following day and not, I suspect, by Veda. I hear instead the brusque authority of my grandfather George. Veda appears silent with shock. All she offers, via her husband, is the possibility that the child must have wandered up the beach behind her and out of sight. She herself was sitting on a blanket, knitting or staring dreamily out to sea in the mild afternoon sun, as I imagine it, with one eye on the child, occasionally plying her with biscuits – until she just slipped out of view. Perhaps the crisis was not immediately apparent. After all, the beach at Chapel was so innocent, like the child and her little legs could not have carried her far. But then came darkness with no trace, and more stricken searching, before Veda had to spend the first dreadful night alone without her daughter.How could she have disappeared? The beach, to begin with, is completely flat. A broad street of spotless sand, scattered with angel-wing shells, it seems to stretch forever in both directions. There are no coves, dunes or rocks where an adult could hide a child everything stands in open view.To reach it, you must walk up and over an artificial incline of heaped sand that is supposed to act as a barrier to the sea a barrier so ineffectual that houses, cattle and villagers have been swept away in historic storms. This little embankment runs for miles along the coastline and from its top people can be seen walking far away in the distance. Tennyson, the Victorian poet born and raised not far from Chapel, was drawn back to it all through his life. “I used to stand on this sand-built ridge,” he wrote in old age, “and think it was the spine-bone of the world!”Veda’s mother once saw Tennyson on Chapel Sands: pressing along against the strident north-easterly winds, black cloak blowing, hat held on in brows-down melancholy.Come over this ridge and even more surprising than the flatness is the way the sand appears to merge with the sea. The beach is tawny brown and so is the brine, because it washes over beds of clay. On a still day they become one vast continuous expanse, an optical illusion only dispelled when a chink of reflected blue sky gles the water or a sudden gust troubles the surface. Perhaps that stillness slowed the events of the day. Veda did not notice what was happening quickly enough. Nobody scrambled up that ridge in time to spot any hurriedly departing figures. Footsteps muffled by the sand, voices dispersed on the mellow sea air, all it took was a prolonged moment of parental inattention. No commotion. Nobody saw, and perhaps there were few other people there to witness the incident, for it was a weekday afternoon in October. Nor was this yet a crowded beach as it is today in high season. Black-and-white photographs from the 1920s show deserted sands or very occasional hikers in hobnail boots and straw hats buying tea from a hut by the Pulley, as they still call the narrow passage where horses once pulled cargoes of tobacco and paraffin over the ridge into the village.The beach was always Chapel’s livelihood. Boats went out for whiting, people searched for mussels, shrimped in the waves at low tide. Ships sometimes ran aground, stalled in the shallows, their debris washing fruitfully ashore. There might be wood for the fire, treasurable in those days before electricity and on Sundays people took bags and went coaling. Stranger things turned up too. A ship running guns lost its dangerous cargo at Chapel and soldiers had to be brought in to handle the live ammunition. A case of glassware was shared out among the villagers, not a single piece shattered. And once a crate of grapefruit spilled out across the sands, odd yellow globes never seen before by anyone except Mr Stow, proprietor of Stow’s Stores by the Pulley where in the world had they come from?All along the sea’s margin, curds of delicate foam arrive on incoming waves. My mother used to hurl them gleefully about, risking her father’s instant reproach. In winter, sea-driven winds direct from Scandinavia skim sand into the air, stinging the eyes and gritting the mouth. There are spring tides when the water feels warmer than the grey rain spattering its surface and blazing summer days when you can swim forever, it feels, along the unchanging shore. This level strand, with its inviting sea, was the great playground of my mother’s youth. She went there with George, paddling in the shallow froth, clambering about the tide pools, digging holes, drawing in the sand. He took photographs of her with his Box Brownie and even in those monochrome days, they show the beach at Chapel exactly as I knew it too, from the holidays of my own childhood.Photography gives us memories we hardly knew we had: the house where we were born, our infant selves, the embarrassing clothes we once wore. But the camera is also capable of giving us memories we cannot actually have because we were not there in the first place. This rare gift, this strange illusion of deja vu, characterises all of George’s pictures for me. He photographs his daughter on the shore, laughing in a swimming costume I remember as pale lilac, embroidered with a butterfly, though of course I neither saw nor wore it. She sits in front of a bell tent with a kettle brewing on a portable stove, its meagre flame the result of the purple methylated spirits that fuelled it, and I scent that sharp stinging reek. There is a picture of her beaming at the bottom of a gigantic hole which I know George has been excavating all day, the sand damper and colder the deeper he digs into the secret innards of the beach. She is carefully seated inside, in clean clothes for the camera. I am with her, smile pinned to my face too, waiting to be lifted back out.Every beach shot is ecstatic, and almost proverbial: my mother looks happy as a clam. Years of happiness, or so it seems, on Chapel Sands. I particularly love the sight of her perched on the shoulders of a sunbrowned man who bears his load with patient resignation. She is about five, so tanned her eyebrows look white, and the lilac costume is nearly slipping from her thin body as she lifts her arms like a gleeful reveller at a festival. The man’s name is Frank, and he is a friend of George, who is in his customary position behind the camera. But a line of apparently innocuous foam is stealing up behind them. Not many weeks after the picture was taken, Frank fell deeply asleep on an inflatable raft on this beach. The tide stole him away to his fate, a dark disappearance somewhere out in the North Sea.All the beach photographs in the Elston family album were taken by George. He would not yield his Box Brownie to anyone else, which is why he never appears on the shore with his daughter. But on the other hand, neither does Veda. I did not notice these absences as a child, leafing through the illuminated treasury of my mother’s early life, images to go with the stories she told, but of course they strike me every time I look as an adult. George Elston is there, recording the moment, but his wife is not. My mother has not a single memory of going to the beach again with Veda.The photographs in the family album are few and tiny, no larger than a matchbox, in a landscape-shaped book that is barely 10 inches by eight. This modest volume has only 22 pages, yet half of them are completely empty. All my life this puzzled me. For years I thought it was a matter of thrift but film for a Box Brownie was relatively cheap, even for a poor family like the Elstons. In fact, George appears to be selecting only the best images from many rolls of film for his album there are rejects in the back, and considerable time passes between one picture and the next. And time is precisely what I should have noticed. There are no photographs of my mother before the age of three. There are none of Veda, George and Betty together, and the whole narrative runs out when she is around the age of 13. One decade in the light, then many black pages.“Betty, Chapel.” This is written in George’s firm hand on the back of these photographs of his daughter. Other people drift in and out of shot, nameless strangers, now forgotten. But she is always given as Betty. Except in one stray image, slipped inside the back cover of the album, never attached, that does not fit anywhere in the sequence. This picture shows my mother as a young child on Chapel Sands, but with a different name on the reverse in an unknown hand. Here she is not called Betty. She is Grace.My mother was born on 8 August 1926 in the shadow of a windmill in a Lincolnshire village. One month later, she was christened Grace in the parish church. No father is cited on the birth certificate the child was to be considered fatherless. At the age of three, she was passed to George and Veda Elston, given this new name Betty, and taken to live in Chapel St Leonards. The Elstons were going to be her parents now. Henceforth, she was to be considered lucky.But she did not feel that way. As an adult she began to call herself Elizabeth, having always hated the name Betty, specifically for its associations with George. It was incredible to me, when young, that this abundantly loving woman could so have loathed her father that she would change her own name to be free of his reach. But I knew very little of her story yet, and neither did she. My mother did not see her own birth certificate until she was 40. She did not know that she was once called Grace, had no sense of her existence before the age of three. The knowledge of her early life came – and went – in waves over the years. Something would be established, believed, and then washed away then it would happen all over again, the arriving wave disrupting the old in a kind of tidal confusion. Even now, in her 90s, she has no idea precisely how or why she ceased to be Grace, but I know that it was before she ever reached the home of Veda and George. She stopped searching long ago now I must discover the truth of her story.The name they will be calling in desperation on the sands that day is Betty – Betty Elston, three-year-old daughter of the Elstons at No 1 St Leonard’s Villas, who are well known in Chapel. George Maybrook Elston – he always signs his name in full, with some flourish – is a travelling salesman. He sells industrial textile soaps, setting off by train every Monday morning with a suitcase of samples to extol to factory managers across England all the way through until Friday. He is away on that autumn day in 1929. So Veda must try to reach him wherever he is, perhaps in Leeds or Liverpool in a commercial hotel. They do not have a telephone, and neither do any of their neighbours, so she goes to the post office at the back of Stow’s Stores to send that frantic telegram. Mrs Stow offers comfort Mr Stow gathers other villagers to join in the search. I suspect they have private thoughts about where she is, and even who might have taken her. Perhaps that is why the police are not involved until the following day. But their guesses will all be wrong.The hue and cry ran along the coast from one village to the next, from Chapel to Ingoldmells and Anderby Creek. If the missing child left any footprints in the sand they led nowhere, or faded out too soon. If there were witnesses who could offer something more useful than the colour of Betty’s dress then they never spoke up, even when the policeman called. The first day passed with no news of her, and then another by which stage the police could surely offer only dwindling reassurance. Three more days of agony followed. And then Betty was discovered, unharmed and dressed in brand-new clothes – now red, as if through some curious Doppler shift – in a house not 12 miles from the shore.My mother has no memory of these events. Nobody ever spoke of them at home, in Chapel St Leonards or anywhere else. It was another half-century and more before she even learned of the kidnap.The dead may be invisible, but they are not absent so writes St Augustine. We carry their influence, their attitudes, their genes. Their behaviour may form or deform our own. The actions of all these villagers have affected my mother right up to this day, most particularly the behaviour of her parents and those who took her. Her life began with a false start and continued with a long chain of deceptions, abetted by acts of communal silence so determined they have continued into my life too. The mystery of what happened, how it changed her, and her own children, has run through my days ever since I first heard of the incident on the beach 30 years ago. Then it seemed to me that all we needed was more evidence to solve it, more knowledge in the form of documents, letters, hard facts. But to my surprise the truth turns out to pivot on images as much as words. To discover it has involved looking harder, looking closer, paying more attention to the smallest of visual details – the clues in a dress, the distinctive slant of a copperplate hand, the miniature faces in the family album.I picture each scene, as we all do with puzzles, assembling the evidence in the mind’s eye. But the habit is also involuntary. My mother is an artist, my father was an artist it is the family profession. Every evening, after teaching at Edinburgh College of Art, my father would draw for hours in his sketchbook. These drawings took the form of lyrical abstractions of the golden mean, the cuneiform alphabet, the newly revealed wonders of the subatomic particle, occasionally a couple of highwire acrobats for his children. But recollections of the day would materialise too: a student at an easel, a bowl of spaghetti cooked by my mother, and all conceived within frames just as her doodles during a phone call would appear as finished tableaux. She might even draw the telephone itself, with its spiralling cord, add an elaborate table, then set the table with dahlias, all while hanging on for a dentist’s appointment.She taught me how to remember paintings in those long-ago days before I could take their image home from the museum in the blink of an iPhone: first draw the frame, then summarise the main shapes and volumes in rapid thumbnail. Rembrandt sketched a Titian in just the same way at an Amsterdam auction. Even the picturing of pictures is ingrained.This is almost the only way that I can think, in fact. And I have thought of this day on Chapel Sands all these years, trying to imagine who took Betty – “presumed stolen” is the police phrase – and how it could have happened, to gauge the force of it, the effect on her and on everyone involved. I picture Veda, bewildered, afraid, inexperienced, not long in charge of this child who is suddenly lost, perhaps never in charge of her again on the sands George, trying to control the situation at a distance, rushing home to take charge Betty, an inkling in blue, moving about the beach in the last of the light, and then gone. The more I have discovered, the more I realise that there was a life before the kidnap, and a life afterwards, and they were not the same for anyone.• The above is extracted from On Chapel Sands: My Mother and Other Missing Persons by Laura Cumming, published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus on 4 July (£16.99).

Now there’s a question. Remember how Zhou Enlai famously (albeit apocryphally) declared in 1972 that it was “too early to say” what the impact of the French revolution had been. He must be turning in his grave at this, because the UK hasn’t even left the EU yet – and may well never do so.However, Brexit is a process, not an event. Whatever happens over the next few months and years, it will dominate UK politics and economics for the foreseeable future. Given this, the third anniversary of the referendum feels like a good moment to take stock.And so we have. But first, some background. In February 2017, we at UK in a Changing Europe set out four “tests” for Brexit. We deliberately did not base them on what was going on in negotiations between London and Brussels. Rather, we decided to focus on outcomes. We argued that the referendum campaign, while iding the country – as Brexit continues to do – also revealed some key themes underlying the British political debate.And there was – perhaps surprisingly – considerable common ground across the referendum ide about what we should be seeking to achieve as a country. Generally, both sides argued that the UK should remain an open, outward-looking country that both economic growth and social cohesion mattered that we should invest in, and improve, our public services and that we needed to maintain the UK’s international influence while preserving democratic control of our own destiny.Three years, three meaningful votes, numerous European council summits and who knows how many negotiating sessions on, our approach has been vindicated. While the timing and form of Brexit is, if anything, even less clear now than it was in 2017, the same themes – growth, fairness, openness and control – continue to frame the debate. And so we’ve gone back to our tests, and tried to evaluate where we’re reached.Our verdict is unequivocal on the impact to date. While the apocalyptic predictions of the remain campaign have not materialised, the economic damage has nevertheless been significant. The vote to leave the EU triggered not just a one-off inflation shock, but also more persistent impacts on investment, trade and migration. So the economy as a whole has suffered, and the UK is already a somewhat less open economy. Nor are we, in any measurable sense, a fairer society. Finally, the seismic political impact of Brexit means that the UK has, perhaps paradoxically, lost control, at least temporarily, over some aspects of its economic future.But these are early days, to say the least. The transitional arrangements set out in the withdrawal agreement foresee a period during which much will continue as now. Though it’s worth noting that the United Kingdom will enjoy far less influence over EU policies than it does as a member state, and hence even less control over its own destiny.Our judgment on the prospects for the future is necessarily more tentative. The consensus amongst credible economists – that Brexit will, overall, be negative for the UK economy and public finances – remains intact. Note how few of those who have published forecasts have seen the need to revisit them. Indeed, that consensus has if anything been strengthened by developments so far, as the prospect of any Brexit that retains single market membership and free movement appears ever more remote.Correspondingly, however, the UK will enjoy considerably more control over a range of policies – trade, regulation and migration – than at present. The challenge of how to translate that gain in notional sovereignty into a genuine sense among the electorate that they have a real say will be central to British politics after Brexit.The prospect of greater control means that the question of openness remains, well, open. Some new barriers to trade with the EU seem inevitable. But so far, perhaps surprisingly, developments in both Westminster politics and public opinion mean that prospects for a relatively liberal immigration policy look better than for some time.The most difficult and uncertain issue remains what future governments will do to address the underlying discontent that, at least in part, drove the Brexit vote. In other words, what can and will be done to make the UK a fairer society. Theresa May spoke of addressing the “burning injustices” in our society, and many – regardless of their views on Brexit – hoped for a “reset moment”, with new policies to address those numerous structural issues that have been neglected in the past.So far, however, the government has simply not had the space, time or capability to develop the domestic policy proposals and instruments – on investment (public and private), skills, regional policy and so on – that would be needed.Will this change should the UK leave the European Union? Unfortunately, the performance of our political system in the three years since the referendum hardly inspires confidence. The infighting, paralysis and accompanying media focus on the Brexit process in Westminster (and yes, some of us must share responsibility here) have both detracted and distracted from any serious or coherent approach to these substantive issues. At the moment, there appears little chance that this will change – but if we want Brexit to be a success, change it must.• Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe.

For his first menswear show since his appointment as creative director of the house in January, the French designer mentally took the audience out of sweltering Paris and brought them to the cool breeze of the seaside. In real life, he invited them to a swimming pool in the 19th arrondissement and provided peach ice teas to set the scene.His newly adopted home has been on a journey of its own of late. In the past four years, a series of short-lived creative-director appointments under old management threw the brand into financial and creative chaos. It was a far cry from the headlining company it was under the former creative director, Alber Elbaz, who steered it to 14 years of sustained success before his acrimonious departure in 2015. In 2018, long-term menswear creative director Lucas Ossendrijver left after 14 years, too. As a result, Sialelli – who has worked in the design teams at Balenciaga, Acne, and most recently, Loewe – is the guy everyone is pinning their hopes on to reinvigorate its trajectory.In January, CEO Jean-Philippe Hecquet revealed that Sialelli had been tasked with “bringing back to life this beautiful and unique fashion house, and once again inspire a passion among our customers,” and the 31-year-old designer heard him loud and clear.As with his womenswear collection in January, the new menswear range looked to the life and travels of house founder Jeanne Lanvin for inspiration. This manifested in a mash-up of fabrications, including intarsia knitwear – like tapestries depicting seascapes she would have picked up and brought home – and beaded embellishment, such as trinkets she might have found in a bazaar.The theme of holiday paved way for nautical stripes – in knitwear and seersucker suiting – and sailor collars. Straw holiday hats (the dodgy kind) had hand embroidered Lanvin motifs and bags were the colour of an orange buoy. Mermaid (taken from Lanvin’s antique taps), shell and starfish prints made repeat appearances, while a series of reinterpreted beer-mat prints ticked the ironic box that’s proven an undeterrable trend of late.There’s a new mood to the house that reflects both Sialelli’s youth and experience. His former employer, Loewe, is a venerable lifestyle brand as much as it is a fashion house, with its artistic collaborations and references central to its appeal. For this show, Sialelli channelled the same stimuli, not least with the invitation which was a limited-edition print by the artist and rising star Luke Edward Hall featuring four men in Lanvin-blue swim trunks.Sialelli, however, is targeting a younger audience than his last house as a concept, this was more first freedom than established culture vulture. He said backstage that he wanted to “express something easy and cool and French” with his team who “are excited about working with new languages” and, with this, he is heading in the right direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443755300a04bbc08de0ca55463b6b689a87e2f7/0_125_2902_1742/master/2902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a4861597f8b4dba5a9b693119536cb","title":"france brazil womens world cup last 16 match report","story":"Captain Amandine Henry steered hosts France into the quarter-finals of the World Cup with the extra-time winner against Brazil.After Thaisa had cancelled out Valérie Gauvin’s 52nd-minute opener just after the hour mark, Henry settled a tense tie at Stade Océane in Le Havre in the first minute of the second period of extra time.The Lyon midfielder stole in front of covering defender Monica to sidefoot home from Amel Majri’s beautifully weighted right-wing free-kick to set up a last-eight clash with Spain or three-times champions the United States.Following a cagey opening 22 minutes, France believed they had taken the lead only for VAR to again intervene in this tournament.Kadidiatou Diani superbly turned Tamires near the corner flag on the right before whipping in an outswinging delivery to the edge of the six-yard box. Coming off her line, the Brazil goalkeeper Barbara could only push the ball on to the shoulder of the incoming Gauvin, a collision that resulted in both players requiring treatment.Only after a couple of minutes was a decision taken for the apparent goal to be reviewed, with the Canadian referee Marie-Soleil Beaudoin deciding Barbara had been fouled.It meant France ended the half without a shot on target, with Brazil’s best effort an acutely angled shot from Cristiane that was beaten away by the right foot of Sarah Bouhaddi two minutes from the break.There was no doubt about France’s go-ahead goal in the 52nd minute as Diani again teed up Gauvin with a low, piercing ball into the six-yard box. On this occasion Barbara failed to intercept, allowing the Montpellier striker to stab home her seventh goal in her last nine internationals.Brazil responded but Bouhaddi tipped on to the crossbar a 55th-minute looping header from Cristiane, who had met a deep free-kick from Marta.Eight minutes later Brazil levelled, courtesy of VAR, as Debinha was initially flagged offside in receiving a through ball down the left. The move culminated in her delivering a cross that was cut out by Wendie Renard but straight into the path of Thaisa to firmly drive home from 12 yards. Despite the offside flag, a quick consultation with VAR from Beaudoin ruled Debinha onside, giving Thaisa her fifth goal in her 65th appearance.At 1-1 after 90 minutes, the game then swung within two minutes either side of the extra-time interval as just before the break Mbock Bathy Nka superbly cleared off the line a goal-bound shot from Debinha following a powerful run into the area.Then in the minute after, Henry struck the winner to the delight of the partisan crowd.After the match, Marta – who scored her 17th World Cup goal this tournament to become the all-time leading scorer at men’s or women’s finals – gave an impassioned speech to reporters in which she willed the next generation of female Brazilian footballers to come through.“There won’t be Marta, Cristiane or Formiga forever,” she said. “Women’s football depends on you to survive, value it more. Cry in the beginning so you can smile in the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54f60048e6b44c702afad7a6bf6d15f2f2d2850/0_71_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de6c01de57a066a3e9502e1d4b96a0d0","title":"why are the best footballers in the world suing their bosses","story":"The Women’s World Cup is nearing the knockout stages, with the tournament favourites, the US, in blistering form.

Naturally, what this means to me is that the thought of meeting her is absolutely terrifying, so I sit down in the Parisian hotel where we have arranged to do the interview and tell her this. She is dressed in black, of course, her slightly hunched posture making her look more like her 64 years. She is sipping a tiny coffee, and isn’t remotely surprised I’m terrified.“People think I’m judging, but I’m not judging,” she says. “I’m watching. It’s different. People sometimes say, ‘My God her eyes will scan you,’ but it’s not to judge you. It’s to get ideas. It’s observation.”Well that’s all right then. French Vogue, under her tenure from 2001 to 2011, was a force to be reckoned with. It looked like nothing else. She believed in bold ideas and she loved boobs, even naked on the cover. She loved cigarettes dangling from models’ mouths. She loved fur. And she loved curves. She used unskinny models Crystal Renn and Lara Stone, and did a cover with the blonde, mainstream-looking model Carolyn Murphy prancing around with Andre J, a black transgender model in a dress and a beard. “Would Anna Wintour ever allow such a thing?” asked the American website Jezebel at the time.I have brought the current issue of French Vogue with me and we flick through it together. All the models are the exact same skinniness. “I do not like this,” she says. “I like older women. I like bigger girls. I like black women. I did everything first. But people forget, because people forget everything. I feel totally comfortable with everyone. It is my strength, to be open-minded, always.”It does seem to be true – she is even interested in my red handbag, which is made of fake leather, cost about £50 from a small animal-friendly brand she’s never heard of, and is bursting at the seams “because you put too much stuff in it,” she says, as if she’s my mum.After too many years spent reading all those books about how to be chic like a Frenchwoman and hating them so much I’d feel compelled to go straight out and buy one about how to date like them, too, and then how to raise children who eat like French enfants, I feel I should be expert in how to be an insouciant yet glamorous Parisian – except it hasn’t worked at all. I am not remotely chic. My love life is so English it’s practically Chaucerian. My child subsists on potatoes. So I want to ask this most Parisienne of Parisiennes for her secrets – can she make me chic? I have this scarf, you see, and every time I tie it in a knot it doesn’t look right. I ask her to tie it better on me, but she takes it off me and ties it better on herself – by not tying it at all.“Never a knot,” she says. “But I learned this from Tom Ford, not France.” She shows me that you either wrap it around your neck once with two long ends dangling down either side of your chest, or you fold it so it’s doubled over and half the length and then thread it through itself a little bit like a tie. Not a knot, you understand.I ask Roitfeld, when I look at a Parisian woman who doesn’t have much makeup on and is in a simple navy sweater and jeans and yet looks stunning, what is she spending her money on. What has she paid for that I can’t see? Is it a dermatologist? Roitfeld nods – I have hit the nail on the head.“To be beautiful costs so much money,” she agrees. “For something you don’t see.” She favours the aesthetician Hervé Herau for her own skin treatments, which she suggests are just a bit of cream, really. She is not keen on younger women getting Botox at all, while she thinks older women often overdo it. “I don’t want to name names but there are some who can’t move their faces any more. Like Cher.” Roitfeld also says that French style is quite conservative, so the chicness comes from a certain coolness in attitude, a lack of overt polishedness, as well as the cut of the trenchcoat, the quality of the shoe. But she insists she prefers English style “because we are not good at fantasy, French people. In New York you see all this crazy nail art and I love that, too, but we French are more quiet, discreet.”But how, how do I become chic? There must be a way. She looks at me sympathetically. “Chic,” replies Carine Roitfeld, “is innate.”In the years after leaving Vogue in 2011, her son Vladimir worked on convincing her that her name was valuable and that rather than keep only working for other brands she could become one herself. She was surprised, but she trusted him, and gradually they went into business together, launching her bi-annual magazine CR Fashion Book, her creative talent agency CR Studio, and now her Carine Roitfeld Parfums, for which she has created her 7 Lovers range, sold exclusively at Net-a-Porter, each perfume is named after a different fantasy lover from her imagination. So there is the English lover, called George, like our royal prince, “Yes, like him, your future queen,” she says, suggesting either a language barrier or that she knows something I don’t about Prince William’s son.George the perfume started off quite green, so she added a shot of cannabis and a shot of espresso to the mix, as you do. Then there’s Sebastian, who comes from Buenos Aires and is as dark and troublesome as the tango, and smells spicy and woody and is “a very selfish lover, the fight between life and death is what I want for him, he’s very proud of himself”. So he’s the one you shouldn’t marry, I suggest. “Oh maybe you should,” she replies, quite seriously. My Englishness floats around me like virginity.Her daughter, Julia Restoin Roitfeld, has also been involved, having taken a nude photo of her mother a couple of years ago that they decided to use for her marketing, after checking with Vladimir. “If he say I can do it, I can do it.” She says the French aren’t hung up on nudity like we are, although when her own Russian father would parade naked around their French apartment during her childhood, the neighbours did sometimes call the police, “because they didn’t like to see it in front of their windows. But he didn’t care.”Vladimir also encouraged her to put a Muslim model in a hijab on the cover of her own magazine. The model was Halima Aden, a Somali who was born in a refugee camp in Kenya before moving to America as a child, becoming her American school’s homecoming queen and entering Miss Minnesota. Roitfeld saw those photographs, used her on the cover and Aden now has a high-profile modelling career, having now appeared on the cover of British Vogue, too.“When I’m thinking about something he say yes you can do this no you can not do this. He gives a balance to me, which I need, because I’m a bit fearless, I can go too far. When I put this girl with the Muslim scarf I was not sure because no one did it before. But he say, ‘I think it’s you, do it. Even if some people kill you, it’s you, do it. You open minds.’” At this point I realise this went beyond a cultural or fashion decision – she genuinely thought she might get murdered. “And they do kill me, but it’s OK.”Wait, Carine, nobody killed you, you’re still here. You mean you were… criticised?“Yes, but a lot. It’s different in different countries. When you’re doing something new, it’s normal to have critics. Every time I did a new thing I get criticised, but funnily I do a new thing because it’s my way of thinking, my way of loving people. I’m very open-minded. This girl was so beautiful, and she wore her scarf, and there are a lot of girls in scarves in fashion now – you’re not going to put them away from fashion, they’re too big now.”I mention how multicultural British Vogue has become under its new editor Edward Enninful. It’s been a huge shift. “Yes, good! But he took my girl! He take my model! Halima become a huge voice now and great for her. I find other ones. It’s part of the world today.”On the one hand, CR is from a world of French chic that is, to me, impenetrable. On the other, she is really very funny and tells me that she likes makeup best when you only take half of it off at night “so you’ve got black smudged around your eyes the next day, and this is why people think French women are dirty,” and that she doesn’t follow the supermodel maxim about obsessively moisturising on aeroplanes, “because I’m always too cold, I just put my big sunglasses on when I land.” Her high-powered morning health routine is composed of the two major nutrients, “espresso and cigarettes”, and she doesn’t like seeing women doing their makeup in their cars, on their way to work. Because it’s vulgar? “Because it’s dangerous!”As for her own relationship with the mirror, “I’m lucky because I’m rather blind now so I don’t see myself very well, it’s much better. Although I have to do my makeup in one of those amplified mirrors. Horrifying.” She did ask Tom Ford to show her how to take a good selfie, help her find her angle, “but he say to me: ‘Oh, you do not have a good angle Carine.’ I say: ‘Thank you Tom, that is nice of you.’ He say: ‘No no it is better that someone else takes your picture.’ I say: ‘OK, nice, stop. Do not say that.’ So I do not take selfies.”She misses Karl Lagerfeld. “I really lost someone very important for me. My father died 20 years ago and Karl was… not a new father for me, but a protector.” Since he died in February, she has taken on the role of style adviser at his namesake brand.I ask if he used to phone her a lot, but no, he would just text her photos of his cat, Choupette. “He was the king of sending big bunches of flowers and handwritten letters. No one else does it like this.” We meet just before French Mother’s Day, and she has been thinking about this, the first one since his death. “I know I will not get my flowers from him with the card saying you are a great stylist and a great mum. Mother’s Day is different date in each country, how could he even know it was Mother’s Day?”She has become so tender at this bittersweet memory that I wonder, almost dreamily, what sort of mum she was.“I was very tough with them. Screaming at them. Brush your teeth, go now to school, go and clean the car if you get a bad mark at school, make your bed, clean the kitchen even if the maid is coming. Say thank you to the taxi driver, say thank you to the waiter in the restaurant. My kids are well brought up because I was so tough with them. But I was very dedicated to them, too.” Every Saturday she would take Vladimir to play football Julia every Sunday to ride horses. She sent them to a bilingual school in Paris so they learned perfect English and now they both live in New York. She feels confident her parenting was a success, because, as adults, “They are very polite, they’re working and they’re not taking drugs. And my daughter would never leave her apartment without making her bed.”So how does it feel to be the most glamorous grandma in the world, now that Julia has a daughter, Romy?“Oh, but on Instagram I see a lot of glamorous grandmothers. Andrea Dellal, who lives in Rio and used to be a model. She is very glamorous and she has seven grandchildren. Very funny and laughing all the time, which is what I love, and she has good bones. And she has this, which I don’t have,” she says, pointing at her lack of cleavage. “But grandmothers now are not like before. My own grandmother seemed so old with her white hair. I dye mine.”You wouldn’t ever let it all out and go fully grey yourself?“Never say never but… certainly not.”She says it’s only younger people who could think the problem with ageing is wrinkles anyway, and that once you get old, you realise that the real trouble is your back, and your eyes going. Roitfeld tells me that six years ago, she had a bad fall, leading to seven operations on her back.“I have very fragile bones. I got the ears of my dad and the backbones of my mum.”I ask if she is in pain at all times, and for the first time she pauses before answering. I sense she doesn’t feel able to admit it, or to complain. “I have some good drugs,” she says, slightly quietly. She then insists that she has to keep wearing heels because flat shoes are, according to her, not good for your back, at which point I realise that chicness is not so much innate as incurable.Even if she’s not leaving the house, there are three things Carine Roitfeld never fails to apply every morning: “A bit of cream, a bit of black, a bit of perfume.” And there we have it: my new mantra.That night, I try her trick of leaving on my eyeliner and mascara and the next morning, oh my goodness, the transformation has actually worked. All right, so it’s my transformation into a panda rather than a Parisian, but still.

But are ‘life extensionists’ any closer to finding the key to longevity? Alex Moshakis meets some of the people determined to become immortalIn 2016, an American real-estate investor named James Strole established the Coalition for Radical Life Extension, a nonprofit based in Arizona which aims to galvanise mainstream support for science that might one day significantly prolong human life. Standards in modern medicine are allowing us to live longer now than ever before. But that is not Strole’s concern. What good are a few more measly years? He is interested in extending life not by days and weeks, but by decades and even centuries, to the degree that mortality becomes optional – an end to The End. “The deathist paradigm has to go,” a line on the Coalition’s website reads. “It’s time to look beyond the past of dying to a future of unlimited living.” It describes its supporters as “early-adopting advocates, numbering in the thousands”.Life extensionists (or longevists, or immortalists) fit neatly into two types. The first are rationalists: scientific researchers at the coalface of gerontology, the study of ageing, chipping away at the many technical difficulties of ending entropy. Strole is the second type. A businessman, he has no formal scientific training, but is nevertheless resolutely committed to the cause, eager to rally behind new findings. He hopes to live indefinitely, or at least until 150. But he is ultimately reliant on researchers finding a way. Consider him less a gerontological groupie than a politely optimistic mega-fan, sitting on the sidelines of science, willing on a major breakthrough.He isn’t alone. Life extensionists have become a fervent and increasingly vocal bunch. Famously, the community includes venture capitalists and Silicon Valley billionaires, non-gerontologists all, and nearly all men, who consider death undesirable and appear to have made so much money they require infinite life in which to spend it. But now mere mortals are joining the throng, heads filled with fantasies of forever. Humans have lusted after immortality for as long as they have been alive. So far the quest has been unsuccessful – we still die! But good news: paradise is reported to be closer now than ever before, and private clinics and online pharmacies are promising to help get us there, “there” being the future, all of it.Strole has been an evangelist of human immortality since he was a child, when his grandmother died, and he felt “a pain you can’t even describe, it’s so deep in your gut.” He was 11, still new to the world, and he came to think of death, like most of us do at some point or another, as deeply unfair.In the early 1970s, when he was in his 20s, he began touring the US as a public speaker, sharing what was then limited gerontological research, but nevertheless extolling its possibilities and advocating the anti-ageing benefits of a positive mindset: “Isn’t life great? You can live forever if you really try!” Because Strole is not scientifically accredited, he mostly based his patter around inspirational healthy-living tips, much of which would now fall under the umbrella of common-sense wellness: exercise, eat well but not too much, look after yourself. But still his message seemed radical, and he was not always well-received. Audiences wary of Strole’s ideas condemned him for testing God’s will, or disrupting the natural order. His concepts ran counter to the common world view – that we live and then we die. Particularly aggravated spectators referred to him as “the devil”. Every now and then he received death threats.Nevertheless, he persisted. He considered himself fortunate to work in a field that meant he was privy to insider information and he became convinced a significant breakthrough was around the corner. To fully prepare his body for the rigmarole of centuries-long life, he adopted a strict health regimen. He fasted, juiced, cleansed and devoured supplements, inviting audiences to do the same. Eventually, a community formed, driven by a shared, urgent aversion to death. “We felt then how important it was to do everything you could to stay alive,” he saysStrole is now 70. He lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, a desert town. In the life-extensionist mode, he avoids dairy and rarely touches bread, though he devours a whole heap of other things. Recently his diet has included pills, branded “Cognitive”, which he takes twice a day and claims have all sorts of nourishing effects on his brain. (What good is maintaining the body if not the mind?) The pills are part of a self-directed anti-ageing process that requires a lot of swallowing. On some days, Strole takes 70 supplements, including a tablet that “energises the mitochondria” (mitochondria produce energy) and whose effects resemble “a shot of coffee, minus the jitters”, as well as vitamins, multi-nutrients and metformin, a diabetes drug that has become so popular among life extensionists that one referred to it as “the aspirin of anti-ageing”. In the early mornings, when the Arizona air is still brisk, he takes a cold dip in his pool to shock his immune system into better function, and at some point or another he lies face-up on an electromagnetic mat that whirs silently against his body and “opens up the veins”, and engages in a breathing regime that, he says, “balances the hormones”.These are typical life-extension strategies, though most people supplement regimens with their own ideas. Some fast. Others arrange expensive stem cell replacement therapies. To maintain a supple mind, the gerontologist Marios Kyriazis, who is in his 60s and heads the British Longevity Society, reads the newspaper upside down, and whenever that becomes too easy, he reads the newspaper upside down and reflected in a mirror. Think of it as an alternative to Sudoko.What good is all of this? The current life-extensionist strategy is twofold. First, achieve a “wellness foundation,” Strole says. Second, stay alive until the coming gerontological breakthrough. All that is required is to “live long enough for the next innovation,” and presuming you do, “You can buy another 20 years.” Twenty years here, 20 years there, it all adds up, and suddenly you’re 300. This is a common view. Last year the British billionaire Jim Mellon, who has written a book on longevity, titled Juvenescence, said: “If you can stay alive for another 10 to 20 years, if you aren’t yet over 75 and if you remain in reasonable health for your age, you have an excellent chance of living to more than 110.” To most, 110 seems a modest target. Why not forever? “It’s not some big quantum leap,” Strole says, by way of explanation. He invokes the analogy of a ladder: “step by step by step” to unlimited life. In 2009 the American futurist Ray Kurzweil, another supplement enthusiast, coined a similar metaphor, referring instead to “bridges to immortality”.Where to begin with the almighty question: why would anyone think this a good idea? Strole is openly afraid of death (who isn’t? He argues), though he seems more motivated by a kind of curiosity. We live our lives knowing they will one day end. Imagine what we might accomplish if they didn’t. (It is not clear exactly what Strole might actually want to accomplish: self-actualisation? World peace? That tricky jigsaw?) The American entrepreneur Dave Asprey, who is 46 but hopes to live beyond 180, and who takes 150 supplements a day, told me: “I can’t imagine running out of exciting new problems to solve!”This motivation is common – the burning desire to help – and it can be seen as morally virtuous or horribly presumptuous, depending on your opinion on the altruistic potential of a bunch of disproportionately wealthy, middle-aged men. (Is it possible the future will become a refuge for the rich, who experience life as a sequence of exquisite events and who might not understand the concept of entropy as relief or escape?) Few life extensionists openly admit to hedonistic impulses. “You can only smoke so many Cuban cigars,” Asprey says, “before you’re like, ‘I’ve got to buckle down.’” Though when I asked the British gerontologist Aubrey de Grey why indefinite life appeals, he replied, half-joking: “My hot tub.”De Grey, a serious scientist, considers life extension a health issue, which is perhaps the field’s most convincing argument. Gerontologists are not hoping to end death, he says. Instead, “We’re interested in people not getting sick when they get old.” No matter how much society rails against the concept of immortality, nobody really wants to suffer through Alzheimer’s, or suddenly fall foul of cardiovascular disease. Gerontology is the act of developing treatments for age-related diseases, de Grey argues – of reducing the causes of death, not death itself. “The benefits of living longer are not the point,” he says. “The benefits are not having Alzheimer’s disease.” For de Grey, indefinite life is a by-product, not a goal.Are we anywhere near to a breakthrough? So far, research has produced modest yields. Gerontologists speak prophetically of potential, but most warn a significant human development remains somewhere far off in the distance – almost in sight but not quite. Richard Hodes, the director of the National Institute of Aging, a US government agency, told me that, though research in animals has led to “dramatic increases in life”, some of them multi-fold, “There has been far less quantitative effect as those models have moved towards mammalian species.” The biologist Laura Deming, who in 2011 established the Longevity Fund, a venture capital firm that supports “high-potential longevity companies”, told me that startups continue to successfully root out biological markers of ageing – inefficient cells, mitochondrial decline – but that, in humans, “We really don’t know right now what will work and what won’t.”Much of gerontology focuses on identifying types of damage that accumulate with age and developing ways to halt or reverse that accumulation. It has been discovered, for example, that as we grow older, certain cells become ineffective but nevertheless stick around, getting in the way like comatose guests at the end of a house party. Removing those cells have helped mice have longer, healthier lifes (this is called senescence.) Similar forms of genetic engineering have been successful in other animal models. But to reach the mainstream, gerontologists must convince government agencies to support human adoption, a complicated and long-winded task, given the general view that death is a normal human process. Why play God?In any case, it is likely that one single longevity strategy alone won’t help us much. Life extensionists enjoy a metaphor: humans are complicated machines, they say, like cars, but mushy. And what happens to a machine if you don’t look after it? It rusts. It splutters and spurts, until it reaches its inevitable conclusion. De Grey considers ageing a “multifaceted problem”. Humans incur many different types of damage. We don’t just rust. We scratch. We dent. Rubbish accumulates in our footwells and grime develops in our engines. We require multiple strategies of repair – constant fine-tuning. What’s the point in removing those senescent cells if that molecular junk continues to build up?De Grey shares Strole’s belief that innovations are coming. But, unlike Strole, he considers current strategies almost pointless. He does not take hundreds of supplements. He does not pay for stem-cell transfusions. “I want to wait and see,” he says. At 56, he is content to sit tight for treatments that have become “progressively more effective… so I don’t have to use clunky, first-generation therapies that may have side-effects.”This does not seem to bother Strole, nor others in the community. Time is running out! Bring on the treatments! At RAADfest, the Coalition’s annual conference – “the Woodstock of radical life extension” – visitors are invited to root through the latest in anti-ageing products, of which there are many. Try DHEA PRO-25, an “anti-ageing hormone”. Or NAD+PRO, advertised to “boost physical and mental energy”. Or Piracetam, from the family of “smart drugs”, or nootropics, which claim to enhance brain function. Strole named the area: “The marketplace of your future.” It is popular among RAADfest guests for the power of its promise: the opportunity to realise the hoped-for self. This is Wellness 2.0 – beyond the cosmetic. We have been anti-ageing our skin for years. Why not our insides, too?Jim Mellon is reported to have described the longevity market as “a fountain of cash”, and has urged friends to invest. Business is already lucrative, but it is a market that appears to take little notice of efficacy. The majority of anti-ageing products remain unregulated – “patent pending”, in the vernacular – and more than a few appear utterly useless. Earlier this year, the US government released a statement condemning the anti-ageing fad of transfusing young blood into older bodies, a practice researchers have proved effective in mice but which, the FDA said, “should not be assumed to be safe or effective” in humans. (The treatments cost thousands of dollars, and led to concern that “Patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors.”)A decade ago, the American Association of Medicine publicly condemned the sale of “anti-ageing hormones,” an industry that was reported to be worth $50bn. “Despite the widespread promotion of hormones as anti-ageing agents by for-profit websites,” the association said, “the scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking.”The oldest person to have lived, Jeanne Calment, reached 122, though she was perhaps not the greatest example of good health: she smoked until she was 117. The most successful life-extension methods we know of seem to be those we have known all along: eat well, sleep well, exercise, reduce stress and rely on modern medicine, which has prolonged average lifes significantly over the past 160 years.Strole does that and more. So far it’s working, he says. He is 6ft 4 and 13st – “the perfect weight” – with a slick of glossy grey hair. Perhaps his regimen is effective. Or, perhaps, like Calment, he has won a kind of genetic lottery, his healthy hair predisposed. It is difficult to say exactly, but, as of this moment, he will die. What happens if a breakthrough doesn’t arrive in his lifetime? “Well, then we’re in a little bit of hot water,” he says. But “it’s better to go for it than to not go for it. It’s better than just settling in. Don’t go quietly into the night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f080fef58fce974e2d19808914a9e5c0793baec/0_129_2160_1296/master/2160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40ffebb2d79154316d872868a09710f9","title":"five ways to improve your 5km run time","story":"Charlotte Arter, the British 10,000-metre champion and Saucony ambassador, clocked the fastest female Parkrun time in the world in Cardiff earlier this year, at just 15min 50sec. She advises varying runs by length and pace. For three to four runs a week, Arter recommends one faster 5km, broken down into intervals (for example, 10 one-minute or six two-minute bursts, with a short recovery in between) a slower, longer session and then a couple of 20- to 40-minute runs at a conversational pace.“Everyone runs differently,” says Arter – but experience helps. “The more Parkruns or 5ks you do, the better understanding you have as to what you can tolerate. Experiment – one Parkrun, try going out a bit harder and see what happens.”It is possible to be “a slave to the watch”, says Arter, but “understanding how you feel when you’re running is important. Some of the best races I’ve done, I’ve just run to feel.” The Team GB and England athletics coach Nick Anderson says he often sees people being too governed by data that may not always be relevant.Arter suggests concentrating on another runner, say 10 metres ahead, as a way to stay focused – if you catch up with them, look for someone else. If she is really struggling, she will count her steps to 100, then start over. “It just helps take my mind off it.”The Cardiff Parkrun where Arter set the world record is “dead flat”, she says. “There is no way I’d be able to run that in the Parkruns that are really hilly.” For a new challenge, try some Parkrun tourism. The statistician and runner Tim Grose has ranked the fastest and slowest Parkrun courses in the UK based on last year’s results. Victoria Dock and Hackney Marshes in London were quickest, followed by Worthing in Sussex Woolacombe Dunes in Devon, Churchfields Farm in Worcestershire and Whinlatter Forest in Cumbria were deemed the toughest.When you eat before a run is personal preference, but it is important to have something, says Arter, who typically has a bowl of porridge. Making sure you are hydrated long before the run is also key. About 20 minutes before a race, Arter likes to do a 15-minute jog, incorporating some bursts of speed, such as two 90-second hard sprints. “I like to get my heart rate and breathing up, so it’s not a shock to the system when I start.”As for where to position yourself, being at the front can mean you avoid congestion, but you risk starting too quickly, says Arter. “I think it’s just making sure you’re not too far back. If you’re going to fight through people, you’re never going to run a really quick time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e513afc42ddd647dccc6ba97589403a8eb4059/0_75_6200_3721/master/6200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7386f989a9983cef3af5b705281bd641","title":"how to stop biting your nails","story":"Nail-biting doesn’t necessarily begin as a result of stress or anxiety, but is often something that is observed and copied from a young age. Over time, it becomes a habit, potentially crossing the boundary into becoming a coping strategy. As a very physical act, nail-biting can provide a welcome distraction or sense of relief when you are feeling anxious or are in a heightened emotional state.The key to changing such habitual behaviours is to determine your motivation. Whether you don’t like the way your hands look with bitten nails, or you want to find a better way of dealing with your anxiety, you need to establish the negative consequences of biting your nails and why you want to stop.Then you need to search for alternative ways of coping or distracting yourself. Simple activities such as reading can help to ert your attention, or you can try occupying your hands by messaging friends or playing games on your phone. It’s essential to create your own self-soothing “toolkit”, involving little activities that help to calm you in an alternative way. For example, when you feel the urge to bite your nails, you could make yourself a cup of tea, or put on a nice hand moisturiser instead.These methods can work in tandem with products that are designed to combat nail-biting, such as bad-tasting nail varnishes. Such products work by attributing adverse consequences to the habit, helping you to suppress the addictive behaviour. However, for sustainable change, the key to kicking a habit is to be proactive. Identify what you are using the habit for and then find other activities that can replace it, creating healthier coping strategies.Dr Elena Touroni is a consultant psychologist and co-founder of the Chelsea Psychology Clinic in London.

They are the ultimate horticultural multitaskers, offering beautiful flowers on a patio outdoors in summer and glossy-leaved evergreen houseplants when brought in for the winter. Of course, there’s attractive, tasty fruit, too – and that’s before we even talk about the uplifting scent of their blossoms.However, there is always one small caveat: the vast majority of citrus plants I see in garden centres are oranges, lemons and the occasional clementine or mandarin – the same fruit that are incredibly easy and cheap to buy in the shops. This is a shame considering that the cost of the plants easily outweighs any harvest you’d ever get. If only we picked some of the rarer varieties (there are at least 100), we could get some wonderfully unusually flavoured fruit that is essentially unbuyable in the shops – all for the same price and level of care as one of their more common cousins. So if you are toying with the idea of giving citrus a go, here are my top three unusual plants for great flavour.For those only familiar with the Persian lime, Citrus x latifolia, which dominates supermarket shelves, Key limes (Citrus x aurantiifolia) will be nothing short of a culinary revelation. With its thinner, more highly aromatic rind, paired with bracingly sharp juice that comes with an explosion of zesty, almost floral fragrance, there is just no comparison. It is this lime that gives really authentic Latin American food its refreshing notes and, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the essential ingredient for Florida Key lime pie. Key lime pie made without Key limes is simply not worthy of the name.On the subject of limes, if you only have space for one citrus I would go for the kaffir lime, Citrus hystrix. While it produces tasty fruit whose zest is a staple of many southeast Asian dishes, it offers a second and much more generous harvest of tasty leaves, too. Used just like you do bay leaves, but with the brightest, fresh lime flavour, a single plant will provide more than you can eat all year round. Considering how eye-wateringly expensive these are to buy in the shops, how hard they are to find and how quickly they lose their flavour once harvested, when it comes to bang for your buck, there is no contest.Finally, I implore you to give the super-trendy Japanese ingredient, yuzu (Citrus x junos) a go. The round, yellow fruit look like oversized mandarins, betraying part of their ancestry. With all the fruity fragrance of the former, combined with the wild vigour of their other ancestor, the Ichang lemon of China, they are probably the hardiest fruiting citrus that can be grown in the UK. Mine has taken lows down to at least -10C with no visible damage, and regularly fruits well. With tiny vials of the juice selling for more than £5 in fancy stores, it’s definitely worth a go. Watch out for its fearsome spines, though."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f755c7ad8f80383438b0e41d8b56d69dc8b33272/0_412_2533_1519/master/2533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2ffe02afc87e16af38e09b3d8b6159b","title":"leaves become intricate crochet art in pictures","story":"Artist Susanna Bauer describes the delicate leaf and crochet sculptures she’s been making for the past 10 years as “a tribute to nature”.

Some were great, and some just refuse to accept that they had to deal with me.”“We are working toward 5050. Some years it’s 6040. It’s a challenge for us and we’ve really taken it on and I’m always totally conscious everyday that the gender balance should be right.”She added: “Every day when I’m booking I’m thinking about that and cajoling stage bookers to be onboard with it. Some of them have been here a long time so it’s a little bit of hustle. But we’re getting there.”Kyle Minogue, Miley Cyrus and Janet Jackson are among the big acts this year, alongside the Killers, the Cure and Stormzy. Eavis has complained about sexism in the industry since she first started booking acts at one of the world’s largest music festivals.Speaking to the Observer in 2009, she said: “People didn’t take it seriously coming from a girl, especially as not only was I a girl, but a ‘daughter of’ … but my dad has in no way given this to me in a nicely wrapped package. He has challenged me, made sure I can do it.”Eavis also told Desert Island Discs her family were often the brunt of local anger at the festival when she was a child in the 1980s. “We used to have people shouting at us when we drove through the village. At the time it felt like we were part of something really controversial and everyone had an opinion, and they used to just let us know. You’d be at a Christmas drinks party and someone would just come over and start shouting.”Eavis said she was not a fan of the festival as a child, and was troubled by the arrival of so many strangers on her family’s land.She said the event could be “pretty scary at times” during the early days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81717e9a9aeef04b613ecd2e0391b139b5a5525/0_25_4470_2682/master/4470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=844dd424bad46e1b0efec8529d9ca55b","title":"ease migration rules for indians to win post brexit deals say mps","story":"Cross-party group of MPs urges greater priority be given for trade talks with IndiaThe government must make it easier for Indians to come to Britain to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with one of the world’s fastest growing economies, a group of MPs have said.Warning that Britain is falling behind in the global race to engage with India on its path to becoming an economic superpower, the Commons foreign affairs committee said ministers urgently needed to update their strategy on India and could not rely on historical links from the days of empire.The cross-party group of MPs urged greater priority for post-Brexit trade talks with India, while calling on the government to facilitate the easy movement of people to come to Britain among priorities for improving relations.Launched as parliament hosts a dedicated day on Indian relations at the start of UK-India week, celebrating the ties between the two countries, the group of MPs told ministers they must either ease migration rules or be honest that tough controls will kill off the prospect of a “global Britain” trading around the world after Brexit.Leading Brexiters have used the idea of turning Britain into an outward-facing, global trading powerhouse among key arguments for leaving the EU. However, critics say the promise ignores the steps such a policy would require, including higher levels of non-EU migration and lower food safety standards.“While the global Britain strategy is barely being communicated in India, the ‘hostile environment’ message is being heard loud and clear.”The Conservatives have maintained a pledge to bring down annual net migration to Britain to the tens of thousands, from about 258,000. In the period since the Brexit vote, net migration has gradually fallen, fuelled by less EU migrants arriving than in the past. Non-EU migration has, however, risen steadily over the past five years.More than 1 million people of Indian heritage live in the UK. However, the report said skilled workers, students and tourists find the migration system hard to navigate, expensive and unwelcoming.“Facilitating the movement of these groups is inseparable from the goal of increasing trade with India. We are concerned that government policy has been driven by the single-minded objective of reducing net migration,” the report says.Britain has lost ground in attracting Indian students and tourists to other countries, while the UK has plunged from being India’s second-biggest trade partner in 1999 to its 17th.Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, said: “India is an essential partner to the UK. Our relationship and the living bridge of people who link our nations will only become more important.“The government needs to make sure the UK is making its support for India clear, reawakening the ties between us and building bridges that are made to last.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f30c5a5d6a89bef8e2a1bec5483d99acc0abb11/0_92_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d03de3a86f8b280f4b436665a6cb8d","title":"all female mars colony possible using frozen sperm says study","story":"Scientists find frozen sperm exposed to zero-g could go where no man has gone beforeAll-female astronaut crews could reproduce in space without the help of accompanying men, new research suggests.The study found that frozen samples of sperm exposed to microgravity retained similar characteristics to sperm samples kept on the ground, raising hopes that a sperm bank could one day be set up in space to help populate new worlds.This could prove interesting for female astronauts, amid reports that future missions to Mars may involve women-only space crews.Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut, said at a conference in 2017 that there had been an unreleased Nasa report exploring sexual desires of space crew members during potential missions to Mars. Sharman said the report had recommended space crews of the same gender – “all men or all women” – because they have better team cohesion.Findings from the small preliminary study, involving sperm from 10 healthy donors, suggest that “the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth” exists, according to the researchers.The study was presented on Sunday at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology annual meeting in Vienna, Austria.Montserrat Boada, from Dexeus Women’s Health in Barcelona, who presented the research along with her colleagues, said: “Some studies suggest a significant decrease in the motility of a human, fresh sperm sample. But nothing has been reported on the possible effects of gravitational differences on frozen human gametes, in which state they could be transported from Earth to space.”One group of sperm samples used in the study had been exposed to microgravity with the help of a small aerobatic aircraft. The samples then underwent fertility screenings and were analysed for concentration, motility and DNA fragmentation.No significant differences were detected between samples that had been given a ride and those that had stayed on the ground.The researchers said that further work was needed to fully understand the effect of space conditions, such as different levels of gravity, and that sperm would have to be exposed to space-like conditions for longer periods of time.“Our best option will be to perform the experiment using real spaceflight but access is very limited,” Boada said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

The documentary-makers spoke to iniduals as well as a surgeon who has performed 3,000 explants and said almost everyone felt better as a result.A MHRA spokesperson said: “I think it’s entirely reasonable that book should be opened again now, and we and our advisory group are already looking at the evidence around this and we would be eager to learn more from patients, particularly about their experiences in this area.”Symptoms associated with breast implant illness can include choking, heart palpitations, brain fog, rashes, hair loss, joint pain, anxiety and depression.The Dispatches presenter, Abbie Eastwood, had breast implants when she was 25. “My hair fell out, I had memory fog, aches and pains, utter exhaustion,” she said. “I had to stop work. I spent whole days in bed.”After doctors told her she had rheumatoid arthritis she found a US website, hosting 70,000 women with the same symptoms, which made her think it could be her implants.The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), changed its stance this year noting that while it did not have definitive evidence that implants caused the ailments complained of, “the current evidence supports that some women experience systemic symptoms that may resolve when their breast implants are removed”.Talking about the 3,000 explants he has carried out, Azhar Aslam, a private surgeon working on Harley Street, told Dispatches: “Anecdotally, almost everyone said they were feeling better.”The MHRA also agreed that breast implant-related cancer is probably under-diagnosed, as more than 250 women prepare to bring a class action over possible links to the disease.The spokesperson said: “Because it’s an evolving diagnosis, the WHO only classified it as a condition fairly recently, it’s reasonable to assess that it probably is under-diagnosed.”The regulator said it has received 57 reports of implant-related breast cancer, out of more than 1m implants in the UK. “We’ve been working extensively with the best expert input that we can get to establish the facts around the safety and performance of these devices and at this stage we have no reason to believe they should be taken off the market,” it said.An NHS spokesperson said: “While there isn’t currently any clinical evidence that these symptoms represent a new kind of illness, women experiencing them should seek advice from their GP at the earliest opportunity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/140c13cd77b75be92db70f08745fec0463da0ac8/0_73_3705_2223/master/3705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=427f8c7d1a43b9ce0d84e3a32fcd095d","title":"andy murray queens doubles tennis","story":"Feliciano López, who brought Tim Henman’s storied Wimbledon odyssey to a losing close in 2007, helped Andy Murray to prepare for his return to the place where he won two of his three grand slam titles when they combined to win the Queen’s Club doubles title here on a grey Sunday evening.In their 7-6 (6), 5-7, 10-5 victory against the Putney-born Joe Salisbury and the American Rajeev Ram – who had won 19 of their 30 matches since teaming up in January – López stood during changeovers to ward off cramp after earlier winning the singles title in three close sets. Murray, meanwhile, proved beyond doubt his hip is in working order again, vindicating his decision to have a second operation in January, when his career looked over.The former world No 1 – who puts this trophy alongside his five in singles at the Queen’s Club – will continue his perfectly paced recovery at Eastbourne this week, teaming up with the Brazilian Marcelo Melo before changing again the following week at Wimbledon, where he will play alongside Pierre-Hugues Herbert, to the annoyance of the Frenchman’s regular foil Nicolas Mahut. In the strange world of doubles, where faithfulness is next to the door marked Exit, López will play at Wimbledon with Pablo Carreño Busta and not his regular teammate Marc López.Nevertheless, these are three quality doubles champions Murray has chosen, underlining his determination to come back to the game as a winner and not just a curiosity from the past.Murray, who turned 32 last month, plays doubles with such verve, touch and good judgment it becomes more obvious in that setting how toweringly skilful he is. For now he will stick to the discipline but soon enough – perhaps at Cincinnati just before the US Open, the scene of his breakthrough major in 2012 – he will be tempted back to singles. Only then will he know how much he has left. Indications are: quite a lot.He lost his serve in the seventh game, though, as Salisbury found space down the tramlines – but with the help of a double fault by the Londoner they repaired the damage to get back to 5-5, then fell 1-5 behind in the tie-break. Salisbury got his team to set point, Murray saved it on serve, and Ram volleyed wide, handing the frame to the Scot and the Spaniard after 51 minutes.The young contenders stayed in the fight, though, and played some excellent tennis, breaking Murray a second time to level at a set apiece and force the champions’ tie-break. López hit five winners in a row and Murray served out the win at the second time of asking.For López, the cloudy afternoon began in sunshine and optimism as he rode his luck to win his second singles title here, outlasting the Frenchman Gilles Simon, 6-2, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (2) – a performance as memorable for his battle against fatigue as his 16 aces in 2hr 49min.“Stay where you are,” he urged the crowd. “There’s more to come.” How right he was.Over five days and six completed matches, López spent 15hr 26min on Centre Court, a small patch of green in west London that has become his home away from home. The crowd love him, and he endeared himself further when paying tribute to the forbearance of his fiancée, the 23-year-old Spanish model Sandra Gago. “She doesn’t know much about tennis, I have to say,” he said courtside, “but after watching me lose a lot in 2018 at least now she knows I’m not a bad player.”López controlled the first set and seemed on course for a straightforward victory. But he trailed 0-2 in the second and, in a series of tough rallies, had to battle back to force the tie-break, where Simon prevailed.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsIt was a similar story in the third. López had match point after 2hr 40min of a close struggle, but hit a tired forehand into the net and the Frenchman escaped again, taking them into another shootout. This time López held his nerve, ecstatic to be champion again as he revelled in the applause of the packed Centre Court.Not a lot falls in his lap, though. When he beat Marin Cilic to win the title two years ago, he had to fight his way through a third-set tie-break – and his career has been marked by extended endeavour. Nobody in the post tie-break era has played in more five-setters when the score has been deadlocked at 6-6.At Wimbledon last year López passed Roger Federer’s record of 65 consecutive grand slam appearances. As he heads for the All England Club next week, that mark has moved on to 69. López is 38 in September, six weeks younger than the Swiss – not as lauded, but certainly as respected.He is only the third player to win both the singles and doubles titles in the same year at Queen’s Club, after Pete Sampras in 1995 and Mark Philippoussis in 1997."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95ded76138901156be63cd190c19b8b111b380a7/297_106_4314_2588/master/4314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7e0685cdc5ad357c520969aa272a147","title":"lewis hamilton f1 ","story":"• Hamilton: ‘When you say it’s boring – I totally understand’• ‘It’s important to realise it is not the fault of the drivers’Leading the Formula One world championship with another easy win from the front at the French Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton criticised Formula One, the FIA and the sport’s teams as being responsible for the lack of competition in the racing, accusing them of repeatedly making mistakes. Hamilton was adamant that if F1 is to improve the drivers need to be more involved in composing new regulations for the 2021 season.Hamilton led every lap of the race at Circuit Paul Ricard and was not challenged either by his teammate Valtteri Bottas, who was second, or Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc who was third. Hamilton has now won six of the eight grands prix this season and his Mercedes team remain unbeaten. Mercedes have won the drivers’ and constructors’ championships every year since 2014.“When you say ‘it’s boring’ – I totally understand it but don’t point the fingers at the drivers because we don’t write the rules,” Hamilton told journalists. “We should put the pressure on the people that are at the head. I think they are trying but for many, many years they’ve made bad decisions.”Last week the teams met the FIA and F1 to discuss the new regulations in Paris, a meeting Hamilton voluntarily attended to offer his opinions. He has been in F1 since 2007 and driven through a variety of different regulations including a range of tyre and aerodynamic formulae. He was convinced drivers have to be more involved.“Do I have confidence it’s going to shift massively? I have faith it’s going to get better, to the point that I went to Paris last week to get involved. I was in that meeting watching all the bosses of F1 and the FIA and all the teams. I have nothing to gain by it. They’re making all these decisions but never once had a driver’s input in that room so if that can be the decisive point that helps shift it so the fans can get better racing, I’d be proud to be a part of that.”The regulations currently having to be agreed by complex horse trading between the teams, the FIA and F1, with vested interests playing a major part. Hamilton was insistent that fundamental change in the governance of the sport was required."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1ad568ba770b155d48cfc7d63019cf3e9ed1c55/79_196_3469_2081/master/3469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bf4709ce1c12bb7450640f66ebaec48","title":"pakistan south africa cricket world cup match report","story":"Let there be no further ambiguity about it: South Africa are out of the World Cup. They had been hanging on for some 18 days since losing a third straight fixture to begin their ill-fated campaign but a limp loss to Pakistan by 49 runs sealed their fate at last. By contrast, Pakistan, nearly as abject as the Proteas at times across their three losses, move on to Birmingham on Tuesday with hope. They need to run the table against New Zealand, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, but thanks to Haris Sohail’s exhilarating 89 and five wickets shared by Mohammad Amir and Shadhab Khan, their route to the final four remains.It is difficult to avoid comparisons with the three times Pakistan have hoisted global trophies. In each of the 1992 World Cup, 2009 World T20 and 2017 Champions Trophy, they had to reach sudden death in the group stage before taking all before them. Until Sunday Pakistan had won four of their most recent 24 ODIs. And yes, when India annihilated them a week earlier they were public enemies at home. But that means nothing now. They are still alive.Doubly so due to Amir’s one-day resurgence. The left-arm spearhead was not in the original World Cup squad, with just five wickets at an average of 92 since his brilliant Champions Trophy. But not only is Amir ( two for 49) back in the team, he is back to his best. His first delivery to Hashim Amla curved back the way that lives on in the mind’s eye from when he first exploded on to the scene. Shadhab (three for 50) was equally superb, duping Quinton de Kock (47), castling Aiden Markram (7) and ending Rassie van der Dussen’s (36) troubled stay to leave South Africa reeling at 189 for five.As the dark clouds descended on Lord’s, Faf du Plessis’ side demonstrated how far behind the pace they are. The 308 for seven Pakistan posted was not insurmountable on a fresh pitch. South Africa’s batting suggested otherwise, allowing the required run rate to climb to the point where the game was in effect over in the 30th over when the captain top-edged Amir on 63. He was a member of the only partnership of any zest with De Kock, which ended 10 overs earlier.It was also with 20 overs to go in their fielding innings that events took a turn for the worse for the Proteas. They started poorly with the ball after Pakistan won the toss, Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq adding 57 in the first 10 overs. But the introduction of 40-year-old Imran Tahir changed that, the former falling to a premeditated ramp and the latter taken spectacularly in the leg-spinner’s follow-through. Both made 44. The build continued through Babar Azam, but at a medium pace. When Mohammad Hafeez was trapped leg before by part-timer Markram from the final ball of the 30th over, Pakistan had advanced to 143 for three.Enter Sohail. From the start, the classy southpaw was assertive: Du Plessis brought back his talisman Kagiso Rabada to burst open the middle order but Sohail instead drove him to frustration with an uppercut six. The No 5 was scoring with touch as much as muscle as the bowlers chopped and changed. Babar holed out for 69 when they had put on 81 in 68, the stand broken in the 42nd over. They were away.Sohail’s striking only got better when Imad Wasim was elevated up the order, passing 50 from his 38th delivery with a shot that was emblematic of his innings: making room off Chris Morris to carve him behind point for four. An over of Andile Phelukwayo worth 16 raised the 50 partnership in 26 balls the second quickest in this World Cup. When Imad’s cameo (23 off 15) ended, they had put on 78 in 40 progressing Pakistan 295 for five. Sohail top edged Lungi Ngidi’s penultimate ball of the innings, but the job was done.When the meaningful damage was done in South Africa’s reply, it got ugly. Their last hope, David Miller, was bowled by teenage quick Shaheen Afridi, prompting a celebration nearly as elaborate as Tahir’s (two for 41) when he was twirling. Phelukwayo continued on admirably for an unbeaten 46 from 32 balls, watching on as Wahab Riaz bowled Morris, Rabada and Ngidi in quick succession, the chase closing meekly on 259 for nine.The renewed optimism of Sarfaraz’s men will have a knock-on effect for England when they play Australia on Tuesday, also at Lord’s. If they can get straight back on the bike after their shock loss on Friday, it will make Pakistan’s late run irrelevant. If they cannot, this could yet turn into an interesting race to the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6f532ac55a60f0fb93441f374cb96a6cc6a844/0_160_4841_2905/master/4841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812a313abef867a39de6628586d3e2dd","title":"australian hannah green wins first major at womens lpga championship","story":"Australian Hannah Green won the women’s PGA Championship at Hazeltine, her first victory on the LPGA Tour, to become the first Australian woman since Karrie Webb at the Kraft Nabisco in 2006 to win a major.The 22-year-old from Perth shot a 72 on Sunday for a nine-under total of 207 to win by one shot from defending champion Sung Hyun Park (68) of South Korea. Green held her nerve and saved par from the bunker with a five-foot putt on the final hole after Park drained an 18-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole to bring added pressure.Among those who celebrated with Green was Webb, who brought Green to America four years ago as part of her scholarship program. Green, in only her second full year on the LPGA Tour, is the first wire-to-wire winner of this major since 2011.She said it was a dream to win in front of friends. “It’s awesome.

Somnium is the story of their romance and partnership – not the bit you might know from the tabloids (last year Katya was pictured snogging her Strictly partner Seann Walsh outside a London pub) but a tale of love, ambition and being proud to be different.Neil choreographs and directs the show, with music direction and costumes by Katya. It’s an easy watch, dashing by at swift pace with a cut-and-paste soundtrack of pop songs.The opening group scenes ooze with the pleasure of two bodies connecting, revelling in motion together, and there’s great chemistry between the Joneses. The inventive choreography pulls in influences from everywhere: contemporary, commercial, hip-hop, MC Hammer, even the floss, as well as jive and Latin – all shot through with punchy attitude.Actor Charles Venn narrates in detail, playing the couple’s former teacher. His self-regarding, plummy-toned delivery jars at times but it’s a useful device in that it leaves no work for the audience. There’s plenty of stage time for the excellent supporting dancers, including the whoop-inducing power moves of B-boy Chris Arias, but the best bits inevitably come from the leading couple. Neil in particular is a fantastic dancer, with a still strength at his core and energy whiplashing out from the centre. There’s a sense of heat building inside him, a heart-bursting swell, and he shows great swagger when partnering Katya, who is a dancer of clean, clean lines but molten in his arms.Somnium has a bit of everything: cheese, comedy, silliness, gimmicks (a UV routine!), an earnest message. Only a couple of scenes fall flat (the fey fashionistas feel like a bit of a throwback in these enlightened times). It’s quite slight, but packs in some great dancing, especially when the electricity erupts into fast, fierce group numbers. It is fun to see dance that goes all out to entertain, where the performers look like they’re having the time of their lives and really, really want you to feel the same way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f482dc65ed754774311c4054ba93279046a15eee/873_302_3474_2084/master/3474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d8da1a768e78fd28059cde6286160d","title":"greenwich docklands international festival review","story":"Various venues, LondonRobotic alien puppets ran riot in south London to open a festival that tackled issues of gender, disability, race and BrexitStories are scattered like confetti across south-east London’s streets for Greenwich and Docklands international festival, where the opening night saw robots roam, streamers fly and dancers dangle from cranes.It starts in a caravan. For the last six months, theatre company Action Hero has travelled around Europe asking strangers to sing love songs. The project responds to a lack of listening from both sides in the conversations about Brexit. Gemma Paintin and James Stenhouse wanted to find something that crossed the ide. Mum, grandma and I pick a song grandma has sung to us since childhood. We scooch in and sing together, if in slightly different keys and time signatures.Action Hero have created hotspots across Europe, with one on Greenwich Park’s meridian line, where you can listen to all of the songs collected. They will play for 24 hours a day in perpetuity a mark of endless love. It’s a generous piece. There’s something extremely buoyant about such a brief encounter frozen for ever.More explosive is Initiative.dkf’s political piece Scalped. Created by Damilola K Fashola, the agitated dance exhibition explores the scrutiny of black women’s hair. Five young women itch with the weight of other people’s judgments, clawing their bodies against the pavement and each other. They create intimacy on this huge outdoor stage as what starts as oppression gives way first to celebration, then to fury. They pulsate to Tyrone Isaac-Stuart’s forceful sound design before climbing a metallic profile of a woman with enormous wigs in varying styles, standing triumphant above our gaze.Across the street is Close-Act Theatre’s i-Puppets parade. Hoisted above human controllers, the robotic puppets pounce with pincers and a giant looming eye, exuding an alien bubbling sound. The three puppeteers look like spies with dark glasses. They’re brilliant at riffing with the crowd, ing into selfies and chasing children down the street.But the monstrous puppets do not provide the most surprising encounter of the evening. Walking to another outdoor venue, we pass a square that, clear half an hour ago, is now covered with blue and white streamers. Kids gather the largest bundles they can manage and hurtle down the street, running blobs of blue. The mystery is solved when we bump into Joyous Urban Mess, a troup of turtle-like figures blowing streamers into trees and at passersby, leaving chaos and laughter in their wake.Nearby, crowds gather for Frock performed by Stopgap, the exhilarating company working with artists of varying disabilities and neuroersities. A gender-bending cast of six play with power as they swirl in straight-laced suits and 50s tea-dresses. Hannah Miller and Oliver Austin’s thudding soundtrack goes from clean to chaotic with tinkling crockery shattered by riotous punk. The dancers grow wilder, demonstrating the ability of the human body when we move away from traditional ideas of gracefulness particularly startling is when Nadenh Poan does a backflip in his wheelchair.As the sun sets, the finale lights up. Transe Express’ Cristal Palace perches a jazz band in a gigantic chandelier dangling from a crane. Another band stream smoke below and dancers leap on stage, sliding from silks and clambering up poles. If there’s a story under the grandiose beauty, it’s not clear – but it hardly matters as these human fireworks draw cheers and gasps from the crowd. The festival is so delightfully, magically strange, it wouldn’t be at all surprising if the performers spun around and disappeared in a puff of smoke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a791ae81beee4fb57f028341c8d4e9494b86d0db/709_683_2002_1201/master/2002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1666fdc81d25cdc3bf15829939c4408b","title":"send us a tip on enjoying lakes in the uk and europe for a chance of winning a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Lakes can be quiet beauty spots, a hive of fun activities or great places for hiking, swimming and sailing.

So it is with ITV’s new six-part drama Beecham House. The first two parts play over consecutive nights – the second episode is on Monday night – which is the equivalent of ripping off a plaster quickly. The remaining parts are to be shown over the following Sunday nights, to let some air get to the wound and hope it heals. Basically, it’s Downton Abbey relocated to late-18th-century Delhi, covering the adventures of John Beecham the man, the chest, the legend. Oh, and the beard. Which, as his mother (played by Lesley Nicol, who was Mrs Patmore the cook in the actual Downton Abbey) notes on her arrival in Delhi after not seeing him for 12 years, “sits handsomely on your face”. That one really should have gone back for an edit.Beecham, his chest, beard and legend are played by Tom Bateman, who looks like a cross between Aidan Turner and Jamie Dornan. I mention this to save you the 20 minutes of squinting distraction that you will otherwise go through before you can work it out and settle. Bateman does the very best he can with the script that, I can only imagine, was thrust at the actors from the wings just before the cameras rolled.Most of the first hour is spent repeatedly establishing Beecham’s anachronistically heroic, or possibly heroically anachronistic, bona fides. If we hear once that he has resigned from the East India Company in protest at its rapacious, colonialist impulses in order to set up as an independent businessman with the good of the oppressed continent at heart, we hear it a thousand times. “I am a fair trader, not a pillager,” Beecham tells the suspicious General Castillon (Gregory Fitoussi, who is also resolutely unfazed by his dismal lines and cipher-character, a mercenary for the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II). “Their expansion plans are shameful,” he announces to the Maharajah he must persuade to grant him a trading licence. “I have severed ties with them.”When Beecham’s old pal Samuel (Marc Warren, as game as the rest of the poor bastards) turns up, having been sacked from the East India Company for giving evidence against it at a trial our hero should have testified at too, he also is assured by Beecham that “Their hypocrisy sickens me!” Out of guilt, Beecham makes him a partner, which may yet turn out to be a wrong move, given that Samuel has reason to resent his friend (“They sullied my name!”) and is, I would remind you, played by Marc Warren – whose CV in its entirety reads “shifty”.No one else has anything much to do. The love interest is a local governess, Margaret Osbourne (Dakota Blue Richards, who was Lyra in the film adaptation of Philip Pullman’s The Golden Compass and no slouch). Her main activity so far is to wander around Beecham’s palatial home (“How nice it must be to sit under this tree!”) and throw into disarray his mother’s plans to marry him off to Violet, the companion she has brought with her from England. Various servants giggle and whisper in corners about the master and the mysterious baby and its attendant whom he has brought with him. “You will learn that I am a private man,” he says, although we viewers are privileged by glimpses of the erotic dreams he has of an Indian woman whose presence he reaches for yearningly as he wakes, only to find his bed empty.As a standard ITV drama it would be risible – a meagre, basic plot being parcelled out by actors constrained by lines that make them sound as if they are giving dictation to a secretary they have every reason not to trust. But as a passion project of the rightly feted director Gurinder Chadha (Bhaji on the Beach, Bend it Like Beckham, Bride and Prejudice) that was touted as a corrective to the tradition of period dramas that prioritise and do not sufficiently problematise the white colonial version of history, it is simply bizarre. So far – and, although I acknowledge that we are just one hour into six, nothing about the series suggests a remarkable deepening or complication of the endeavour is imminent – it is a straightforward white saviour narrative, and unless having white characters who are as underdeveloped as the Indian ones is the equality dreamed of, it is hard to see how any progress has been achieved here at all. As it stands, it’s a jewel in no one’s crown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0bd1ee209cf6cbc3a4669c849b0b02b767a20/0_11_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f5c82086065fccbde3fd5d4433d97","title":"why are we like this the psychology of procrastination","story":"From deleting social media apps to setting limits on your screen time – here’s how to deal with the existential malaise of putting off the important thingsYou know that thing you’ve been putting off doing? Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible. Your books can go unorganised for a while yet.For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fa64062b972f6b03ea58c6dc5019e1946b89e43/0_819_1432_859/master/1432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08704430ed0c5da2ce6125469d5a7954","title":"air canada woman wakes up alone darkened plane","story":"Air Canada said on Sunday it was looking into how crew members could have disembarked from a plane without noticing a sleeping passenger who was left behind.The airline was responding to an incident involving a woman who described waking up “all alone” on a “cold dark” aircraft after a flight to Toronto earlier this month. “I think I’m having a bad dream bc like seriously how is this happening!!?!” Tiffani Adams recounted in a 19 June Facebook post provided by a friend, Deanna Noel-Dale. The airline confirmed the incident took place but declined to comment on its disembarking procedures or how the passenger may have been overlooked. “We are still reviewing this matter so we have no additional details to share, but we have followed up with the customer and remain in contact with her,” Air Canada said.Adams wrote that after she woke up, she called Noel-Dale to try to explain what happened, but her phone died and she couldn’t charge it because power to the plane was off. She said she was “full on panicking” by the time she found the “walky talky thingys in the cockpit”, which also didn’t work. After no one saw the “SOS signals” she made by shining a flashlight out the window, she unbolted a cabin door. Facing a steep drop to the tarmac, she leaned out of the aircraft and called over a ground crew, who got her out. The passenger wrote that Air Canada personnel asked if she was OK and whether she would like a limo and hotel but she declined the offer. She said airline representatives apologized and said they would investigate. “I haven’t got much sleep since the reoccurring night terrors and waking up anxious and afraid I’m alone locked up someplace dark,” she wrote. Attempts to reach Adams through Noel-Dale’s Facebook account had not received a response by late Sunday morning. Air Canada said in a Facebook response to the post that it was surprised to hear the story and “very concerned”, asking Adams to send a private message with her flight details. “We’ll take a look into it,” the airline wrote.

He believes the crossings – widespread across much of Europe as well as at supermarkets, stations and airports in the UK – will help pedestrians make local journeys more safely.But the Department for Transport (DfT) says he cannot, because under UK law zebra crossings have to be wired to the electric mains and have belisha beacons and zigzag markings, which cost £30,000.Boardman, who won gold in the velodrome at the 1992 Olympics, wants bargain zebras as an integral part of his “Bee Network” – a fully joined-up cycling and walking network covering 1,800 miles in Greater Manchester.He has estimated the cost of the network at £1.5bn but so far has been given only £160m, which he does not want to be eaten up buying belisha beacons.He argues that his crossings simply reinforce a little-known legal right of way for pedestrians when crossing side roads and that motorists would instinctively know to stop, belishas or not.“These crossings enforce a right that everybody has forgotten about,” Boardman told the Sunday Times. “The law is this: that when you put a foot on the carriageway, you have the right of way. But people don’t do it, because there is no point being in the right, while at the same time being in hospital after getting run over. I would like to see thousands of zebra crossings in Manchester.”A trial recently began, commissioned by Transport for Greater Manchester and conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory, which Boardman hopes will prove his zebras are safe. Initial results suggest they make crossings safer for pedestrians and are therefore “legally robust and responsible”, he told the .Last year, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) wrote to the DfT to recommend that the “traffic sign regulations and general directions” is updated to authorise the use of side road zebra crossings without the need for beacons or zigzag lines.“Crossing side road junctions in the UK is stressful. There is an assumption that turning traffic will not give way and will rarely indicate, so people must either grit their teeth and accept whatever fate brings them or move away from their desired line to a distance where they feel they could react quickly enough to avoid an approaching car. This issue is exacerbated for those with disabilities and those with small children,” the GMCA wrote.Last June, Boardman’s team painted an “implied zebra“ on a side road in Salford, supported by the local council. Officers monitored how the crossing was used and confirmed it worked, said Catriona Swanson, who was the borough’s cycling officer at the time. But the DfT ordered the council to paint over it after a few months, according to Brian Deegan, Boardman’s technical adviser.Implied zebras are already common on private property. There is one at Manchester’s main station, Piccadilly, which is owned by Network Rail. Last summer, the stripes were painted in rainbow colours to celebrate Pride, the LGBT festival.A DfT spokesman insisted the government was not at odds with Boardman and said: “Zebra crossings are designed to ensure the safety of all road users – beacons are necessary for visibility, while zigzag markings prevent parked cars blocking the view of pedestrians and cyclists.“We will always put safety first and any potential regulation change would need to be based on robust research and supported by off-road trials.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97ef98cac882e51e4cbd91f1160e8c7182856c94/654_1451_2613_1568/master/2613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d074a4120e31cd0506d7ca17d896c6","title":"communist party usa chicago cpusa convention","story":"In Chicago, an American party derided and feared for 100 years looked eagerly to a brighter futureAs the Communist party USA kicked off its 100th anniversary celebration, Jarvis Tyner called for delegates and guests at the national convention in Chicago to “set the record straight” about one of American politics biggest historical bogeymen.“The truth is the communist party isn’t out to hurt you,” Tyner, vice-chair of CPUSA and its candidate for vice-president in 1972 and 1976, told a large and erse crowd. “It will set you free.”The remarks, met with applause, came on the first day of CPUSA’s 31st national convention – and at a moment in American politics in which democratic socialism and progressive ideas are increasingly finding a home in the mainstream of the Democratic party.Communists from across the US, along with international delegates from Germany, Canada, Venezuela and elsewhere, sought to send the message that their party has been the most consistent champion of those ideas, has been on the right side of some of the most consequential ideological battles of the last hundred years, and is ready to continue the fight into its second century.“We are a party of action,” said Chicago activist Pepe Lozano in an opening address on Friday. His father, Rudy Lozano, was an aldermanic candidate in the city in the early 1980s who rallied Mexican and Puerto Rican voters to support Harold Washington, the first African-American mayor. The elder Lozano was shot dead in 1983 in what supporters say was an assassination.“We are united,” Lozano said. “We are determined. We are raring to fight.”Communism has long been regarded with fear in the US, viewed as antithetical to American values and democracy. The US spent much of the 20th century in battle against it, seeking to contain it in Korea, Vietnam and elsewhere, hot wars fought as part of the cold war with the Soviet Union.Decades were spent attempting to root out communism at home, including during the first red scare following the first world war and the second red scare of the 1940s and 1950s, in which Senator Joseph McCarthy led “investigations” to out suspected communists in government and public life. Accusations of communism, as well as socialism, continue to be leveled by conservatives against mainstream liberal politicians, including Barack Obama.But there is also a long history of communism and radical leftwing politics in America, as leaders and attendees pointed out in Chicago.“The story of our communist party is inextricably intertwined with the development of the American working class and building its labor movement,” Lozano said. “Our roots are in the profound American struggles for democracy.”Lozano cited party support for the civil rights and anti-war movements, for battles against police abuse and mass incarceration, and for drastic action to combat climate change including the Green New Deal proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the faces of the young democratic socialist movement within the Democratic party.To attend the CPUSA convention is in some ways to encounter familiar concerns and ideas. Attendees were animated by issues that 2020 presidential hopefuls have pushed to make part of the Democratic platform, including plans to address climate change, inequality and hawkish foreign policy – as well as opposition to Donald Trump, who has sought to “ide working people”, attendees said.“Our job as communists is to unite people,” Ismael Parra, from Los Angeles, told the .“We’re talking about people being joined together,” said Tere Gonzalez, also from LA.Mainstream liberals would have found other elements of the convention less familiar. In a student center on the campus of University of Illinois Chicago, in a large hall past a Dunkin Donuts and a PNC bank, attendees invariably greeted one another as “comrade”. A few wore apparel bearing a hammer and sickle.The convention began with the entire crowd enthusiastically singing This Land Is Your Land, Woody Guthrie’s classic folk song. And while even some of the most progressive mainstream politicians, Elizabeth Warren among them, have bristled at the “socialist” label, it can be striking to hear Americans openly discuss their support for communism.“Nobody is better at beating red-baiting than the reds,” Tyner joked, suggesting the Communist party could best defeat Republicans in 2020.While Tyner suggested during his speech that the party has differences with Ocasio-Cortez and others of the new wave of democratic socialists, that surge of progressive energy appeared to have emboldened the party and attracted new interest.People’s World, the news outlet affiliated with CPUSA, has seen increased readership this year, editor-in-chief John Wojcik and managing editor CJ Atkins told the convention. Several guests were not members of the party, but at the convention to learn more about it.Timothy Faye, who is not a communist but is interested in leftist causes, came to Chicago from Rhode Island. While many older Americans may have a negative view of communism, he said, younger people like him may be more open to its message.“There’s a leftward shift among young people,” Faye told the . “It’s a reflection of the economic environment people are in.”The party seems to see an opportunity to build.“Together, we will win,” Lozano said, concluding his speech. “Our victory is inevitable. Viva the Communist party USA!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900fa41ef8cfefe8ef7e28288f6544e817159ee0/516_1008_2526_1516/master/2526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dc5852fe4a831641798dee823fd262a","title":"erdogan faces scrutiny once more as istanbul goes back to the polls","story":"Voters embrace CHP party campaign bridging religious, class and ethnic idesTurkey’s opposition has won a high-stakes rerun of the Istanbul mayoral election, a serious blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and a landmark victory in a country where many feared democracy was failing.Shortly after initial results pointing to a landslide win for the opposition coalition candidate, Ekrem İmamoğlu, emerged on Sunday evening, the candidate of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), Binali Yıldırım, conceded and congratulated his rival.The repeat election, designed to undo İmamoğlu’s narrow surprise win in the 31 March contest, was an unprecedented test for both Turkey’s fragile democratic institutions and Erdoğan’s political future.Yıldırım’s swift concession saved the AKP the embarrassment of watching the vote count add up to a second defeat, but the loss is likely to lead to intense new power struggles inside the coalition government. Opposition parties were jubilant.“We are starting a new page in Istanbul. On this new page, there will be justice, equality, love. Today 16 million Istanbullus have refreshed our belief in democracy,” İmamoğlu told supporters in a televised speech.“I thank them all from my heart. You have shown the world that Turkey still protects its democracy. And we have shown other countries who try to go down the road we were choosing that it is no road at all.”Crowded parties broke out on Istanbul’s main shopping streets and in liberal neighbourhoods.“This has brought people hope,” said Semra Deniz, 35, from the city’s artistic hub, Cihangir. “I came to this neighbourhood six years ago and a lot has changed. Places closed down. I hope the cultural erosion is reversed and people feel free to express themselves again.”Despite blanket pro-government media coverage, İmamoğlu, a previously anonymous local administrator, stunned the country with his narrow win in March. For Erdoğan, the loss of his hometown, where his political career began in the 1990s, was a personal blow.After weeks of AKP appeals, Turkey’s electoral board upheld one complaint regarding ballot counting and annulled İmamoğlu’s victory, sparking outrage even within the ruling party’s ranks, where some feared the board had dented the AKP’s democratic credentials.At polling stations on Sunday both CHP and AKP voters stressed that they wanted the repeat election accepted as final.“Clearly there is some funny business going on here but I don’t know what,” said AKP voter Cihat Içyumaz, 65, who like many Istanbullus cut short his summer holiday to vote. “For me, chaos after this round of elections is the scariest outcome. I just want the candidate who is best for Istanbul to win.”Yıldırım worked hard in the second round of campaigning to close the gap with his rival, reaching out to the party’s base in working class and conservative neighbourhoods, voters who punished the government for Turkey’s economic crisis by staying away in March.However, in both a televised debate with İmamoğlu and in conversations with voters, Yıldırım struggled to explain why the repeat election was necessary.İmamoğlu was embraced by voters for a platform which focused on bringing people together across the city’s religious, class and ethnic ides, and was able to paint his new campaign as a battle for the future of Turkish democracy itself.“Erdoğan has to do some serious house-cleaning in his government and reassess his policy making process to bounce back from this, or the suggestion that this is the beginning of his decline will get louder.”Rumours are already circulating that the second defeat could trigger a snap national election as Erdoğan seeks to oust increasingly fractious elements in his governing coalition.Observers note that İmamoğlu’s mandate is still far from assured: the 2015 general election which saw the AKP lose its majority in parliament was rerun and other charismatic challengers to Erdoğan have been imprisoned or folded under pressure.The AKP still controls 25 of Istanbul’s 39 districts and holds a majority in the municipal assembly, which will make it difficult for İmamoğlu to deliver on campaign promises. The margin of his victory, however, shows that at least in Istanbul there is a strong appetite for change after 16 years of national AKP rule.“People say it takes a long time to build a democracy, but what today’s result shows it takes a long time to kill a democracy too. Clearly, Turkey’s democratic structures are incredibly resilient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db9d052f9bd38d7ec1f46bb1c11c716780bd881/886_857_5030_3018/master/5030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98e1322f4fe81b22f26117d1644129dd","title":"iran may pull further away from nuclear deal after latest sanctions","story":"US president says move will be made on Monday as Iran warns it may step up nuclear activitiesDonald Trump has pledged that Iran’s “absolutely broken” economy will face “major” new sanctions on Monday, as Iran countered it would take further steps to increase its nuclear programme unless Europe does more to shield it from US pressure over the coming fortnight.The US president claimed that Iran wanted to negotiate because of the relentless economic pressure from sanctions. Tehran has so far rejected any talks while sanctions remain, and there was no sign of relief on Sunday. Despite calling off airstrikes that had been planned in reprisal to the downing of a US drone on Thursday, tensions in the Gulf remain high.On Sunday, one person was reported dead and seven wounded in a suspected drone attack on a Abha airport in southern Saudi Arabia. The Houthi movement in Yemen, which is backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the second drone attack on the Abha airport in 10 days, and also claimed to have struck the airport in Jizan, on the south-west Saudi coast.John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, warned Iran not to mistake US prudence for weakness. It was reported that the US carried out a cyber-attack on an organisation linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards suspected of being involved in tracking and attacking tanker traffic and naval deployments in the Gulf. A US official told CNN the US cyber command targeted software that was used to track tankers targeted in attacks in the Gulf of Oman on 13 June.Iranian cyber spies are also said to have extensively used social media, approaching sailors online while pretending to be young women, to mine intelligence on their ships’ movements.Bolton was judged to have lost an inter-agency dispute last week when Trump pulled back from missile strikes on three Iranian military sites. Trump said the US air force was “cocked and loaded” when he decided the estimated civilian death toll of a military action would be a disproportionate response to Iran’s downing of the unmanned drone.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran threatening to resume higher uranium enrichment.John Bolton announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to \u0027a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u0027.Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal. The US responds by imposing sanctions on Iran\u0027s metals industry.The EU urges Iran to respect the nuclear deal and says it plans to continue trading with the country despite US sanctions.\u0026nbspThe US says it will move a Patriot missile battery into the Middle East to counter threats from Iran.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It\u0027s not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: \u0027If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Semi-official media in Iran report it has quadrupled production of the low-enriched uranium used for civilian applications. Iran is allowed to enrich uranium, but increased production could lead it to exceed the stockpile limits in the nuclear deal.Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia\u0027s King Salman hosts high-level summits in Mecca. He calls on the international community to use all means to confront Iran and accuses them of being behind \u0027terrorist operations\u0027 that targeted Saudi oil interests.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift as 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US \u0027spy\u0027 drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Bolton, speaking in Jerusalem before a three-way conference between the US, Russia and Israel on the future role of Iran in Syria, insisted the US had not lost its nerve.He said no one had granted Iran “a hunting licence in the Middle East”. He echoed Trump’s warnings that the US military was “rebuilt, new and ready to go”, and said “biting” new sanctions would be imposed on Monday.“Iran’s continued pursuit of nuclear weapons, its threats to exceed the limits set in the failed Iran nuclear deal in the coming days … are not signs of a nation seeking peace,” Bolton said.However, back in Washington Trump issued one of his frequent reminders that Bolton does not have the final say in US national security matters, but is just one voice among several competing views.“John Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him he’d take on the whole world at one time, OK? But that doesn’t matter because I want both sides,” Trump told NBC News’s Meet the Press on Sunday. He pointed to the disastrous US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 – a war Bolton aggressively advocated – as a reason for caution in the Middle East.However, the president warned that any more hostile acts by Iran could draw a more forceful military response than the one planned and aborted on Thursday.“So what happened is I said, ‘I’m not going to do it. I’ll save it. If they do something else, it’ll be double’,” Trump told NBC, adding that he would continue to ramp up sanctions.“We are putting major additional sanctions on Iran on Monday,” Trump tweeted.In his NBC interview he added: “I think that they want to negotiate. I don’t think they like the position they’re in. Their economy is, is absolutely broken.”As he has done on almost every occasion he has discussed Iran, Trump offered direct talks with “no preconditions” focused on Iran’s nuclear programme.He said he told Shinzō Abe, before the Japanese prime minister visited Tehran on 12 June: “Send the following message: you can’t have nuclear weapons. And other than that, we can sit down and make a deal. But you cannot have nuclear weapons.”On further questioning he added the demand that Tehran should not have a ballistic missile programme, and suggested he wanted a tougher inspection regime.Iran has said it does not want to acquire nuclear weapons and has agreed not to do so under the non-proliferation treaty. Until now, it has stuck to the limits on its nuclear programme agreed in a 2015 multilateral deal, which Trump withdrew the US from last May and has since tried to destroy.Faced with a US-imposed oil embargo and a web of other sanctions, Iran has warned in recent months that it will cease to abide by some elements of the 2015 agreement.It is allowing stocks of low-enriched uranium to build up, and President Hassan Rouhani has warned that if Europe does not do more to shield Iran from US sanctions by a 8 July deadline, it will take the much more significant step of increasing its uranium enrichment levels, bringing it closer to weapons grade.On Sunday, the head of Tehran’s strategic council on foreign relations suggested Iran could further raise the stakes.Speaking after meeting the British Middle East minister, Andrew Murrison, in Tehran, Kharazi said Europeans should provide capital for the special trading vehicle designed to enable European trade with Iran and circumvent US sanctions. Accusing Europe of failing to deliver on its promises, he said: “One should see whether Europe is making empty promises or taking practical steps in the two weeks that remain until the deadline.”European solidarity in support of the 2015 nuclear deal and resistance to the drift towards conflict may be affected by the current Conservative Party contest to replace Theresa May as the UK’s prime minister. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and one of the two contenders for the top job, said the UK could support the US in a conflict with Iran, depending on the circumstances.“We will stand by the United States as our strongest ally but of course we have to consider any requests for military support on a case-by-case basis,” Hunt said while campaigning in Scotland, according to the Daily Mail. “We want to de-escalate the situation but we are of course extremely worried.”The UK has its own points of friction with Iran. On his visit to Tehran, Murrison raised the plight of the Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is on hunger strike in a Tehran jail. She is serving a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she denies.Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, is on a sympathy hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London. A stream of well-wishers have been to visit him, including Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson.

There will be special phonelines, and “cool rooms” will be available between 2pm and 6pm across the capital.The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said on Sunday that as many as eight major swimming pools would stay open after 10pm and swimming would be allowed in the canal basin at La Villette. She also said three temporary outdoor pools would be set up for in highly populated, lower-income areas of the city, which would be free to use.Paris has relatively little green space and has been working for years on how to “green up” and introduce more plants in order to counter the heat held by stone and concrete. Hidalgo told the Journal du Dimanche that 13 large parks would stay open all night during the anticipated heatwave because the temperature there would be one or two degrees lower than in the rest of the city. She said five more parks would be added if the heatwave continued.The city’s growing homeless population, which includes high numbers of migrants who sleep rough in groups of tents under bridges or by roads, is also a particular concern. Hidalgo said 5,000 reusable flasks of water would be distributed to people living on the street, and more than 1,000 drinking fountains added across the city. Aid workers would increase their rounds of the city to check on rough sleepers, she said.The homeless help centre at La Chapelle, an area with large numbers of undocumented migrants and refugees sleeping rough, “would stay open seven days a week, with a capacity for 400 showers a day”, she said. Campaigners have long complained that not enough year-round support is available for the city’s homeless.Hospital emergency rooms in Paris are braced for an increase of patients just as many have led strike action over insufficient resources."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3934942.1561304561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us to impose new sanctions on iran as early as monday","story":"Iranian politicians chanted Death to America! during a parliament session on Sunday, June 23rd amid escalating tension with Washington following the downing of an unmanned US drone. Video: ReutersThe United States will unveil new sanctions on Iran as early as Monday, US national security adviser John Bolton has said, warning that Iran should not “mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness”.Speaking alongside Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu during a visit to Israel, Mr Bolton noted that President Donald Trump had just stopped the strikes from taking place “at this time”.“As President Trump said on Friday our military is rebuilt, new and ready to go,” he said.Mr Bolton was speaking days after Mr Trump abruptly called off planned air strikes on Iranian targets that had been planned as retaliation for a shooting-down of a US naval drone in the Persian Gulf region last week. US media also reported that the US launched a cyberattack on Iran’s weapons systems on Thursday, disabling the computer systems that control missile launchers though there was no confirmation from the White House.Mr Bolton’s comments in Tel Aviv were seen in part as efforts to reassure US allies in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, that the United States will remain tough on Iran, despite aborting a planned air strike. His threat of new sanctions echoed warnings from Mr Trump over the weekend that new sanctions were imminent.Mr Netanyahu said he welcomed the prospect of further economic pressure on Iran, adding that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal had only served to give the country more cash, arguing that “tens of billions of dollars” had poured into Iran’s coffers.Mr Trump was asked on Saturday as he left the White House for Camp David if he still had confidence in Mr Bolton, who is well-known to have hawkish views on Iran and previously advocated regime change. “I do,” he replied. “John Bolton is doing a very good job but he takes generally a tough posture,” he said, adding: “ultimately I make the decision”.Mr Trump warned in an interview with NBC that war with Iran would be “obliteration like you’ve never seen before.” But he struck a more conciliatory tone in his comments to journalists on Saturday as he departed for Camp David, claiming that he could help “make Iran great again” if Tehran co-operates.NegotiationsMr Trump suggested that he could be open to negotiations with Iran. “We’ll start all over. We could have a deal with them very quickly. It’s up to them,” he said. He dismissed the 2015 nuclear deal struck by president Barack Obama and other international powers, arguing that it would have allowed Iran to legally build a weapon in a number of years and did not allow full inspection rights.“We’re not going to have Iran have a nuclear weapon. When they agree to that, they’re going to have a wealthy country. They’re going to be so happy, and I’m going to be their best friend. I hope that happens . . . but it may not.”He said that, as a New Yorker, he knows a lot of Iranians, describing them as “very smart, very ambitious”.“I come from New York City. We have a lot of Iranians and they’re great people,” he said. “I have many friends who are Iranians. I don’t want to kill 150 Iranians,” he added, referring to his decision not to sanction military strikes on Iran after he was advised that 150 people might be killed. He again defended that decision, repeating his view that a military strike would have been disproportionate to the shooting-down of an unmanned US drone.“We want to be proportionate. We’re getting lot of praise for what I did,” he said. “We have plenty of time, we have plenty of time.”He also said that Iran was wise not to shoot down an American aircraft carrying passengers, following claims from Tehran that it refrained from shooting down a second aircraft last week.The president also dismissed suggestions that the ongoing standoff between Washington and Tehran was about oil and keeping access to the Straits of Hormuz, a key thoroughfare for oil tankers.“We are the number one oil producer – oil and gas – in the world by far,” he said. “We don’t really need the straits anymore. The biggest beneficiary of the straits is China. Ninety-one per cent of their energy comes out of the straits,” he said, adding that Japan and Indonesia also benefit. “We are doing them a very big service.”The UN Security Council which includes China and Russia as members, is expected to discuss Iran on Monday at the request of the US. Mr Bolton is also due to meet with Russian officials to discuss the situation in the Middle East, including in Syria."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Ministry of JusticeCyclist thanks well-wishers for helping with £100,000 legal bill after he collided with woman looking at phoneForeign cannabis firms set up shop in UK hoping the drug will be legalised for recreational useBoris Johnson renews commitment to leave the EU on October 31 as he insists he will not \u0026#39bottle\u0026#39 BrexitSuzy Lamplugh may have used \u0026#39Mr Kipper\u0026#39 as a cover storyBeecham House, episode 1, review: An ambitious drama with a worryingly wooden heroNorthern Ireland\u0026#39s Brexit backstop \u0026#39can be made obsolete using existing technology within three years\u0026#39Nye Bevan relative was \u0026#39let down by NHS\u0026#39 before dying of lung cancerFacebook plans to encrypt messages will put children at increased risk of sexual abuse, warns NSPCC chiefSpending watchdog launches investigation into MP with biggest expenses bill in ParliamentComment: It\u0026#39s been three long years since we voted to Leave – which is why we can, must and will do so by October 31Boris Johnson still planning to live with Carrie Symonds in Downing Street despite rowCharles Dickens was \u0026#39outraged\u0026#39 by cheap parodies which made Victorian publisher a fortuneBritish tennis player with only six fingers wins Wimbledon wildcardHollywood comedy in decline as Netflix takes overBoris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedErdogan\u0026#39s ruling party loses Istanbul election in major blow to Turkish presidentUkraine urges Council of Europe not to lift Russia banJihadi Jack feels \u0026#39guilty\u0026#39 for his parents\u0026#39 convictionCzechs turn out for biggest protests since the end of Communism Erdogan\u0026#39s party loses controversial re-run of Istanbul electionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

Jihadi Jack taught children about terror and created propaganda videos, he has admitted in an interview before his parents were convicted of funding terrorism.Jack Letts, 23, said he left the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) after fearing for his life when 20 of his friends were killed.In an interview with the BBC, Letts admitted that he taught recruits under the age of 15, referred to as cubs, about Isil ideology.After almost losing his arm in battle he became a contributor to Dabiq, an online recruitment magazine, before making Isil videos.It allegedly took Letts three months to get to Syria after travelling through Kuwait, Jordan and Turkey before crossing into Syria at Al Raj.Jack Letts talks from Kurdish jailHe claimed to have been radicalised in part by a British Isil cell from Portsmouth, Hampshire, most of whom are reportedly dead.In the interview at a Kurdish prison camp, Letts said: The so-called Islamic State. If it was an Islamic state, I wouldn\u0027t have left.The main reasons I left the so-called Islamic State is because they started to kill people I know them personally that are Muslims.I had a group of about 20 friends that all left the so-called Islamic State. They all left at one time. One by one, they started to kill them.Jack Letts in Raqqa, SyriaLetts said that he was caught as he tried to escape the border into Turkey after expecting safe passage through Al Nusra-Front territory.He said: They would help us leave. They would get us a smuggler. Nusra Front not great guys, but they\u0027re a lot more trustworthy than the Free Syrian Army.Letts\u0027 commented on his mental heath, claiming that he was diagnosed with Tourette\u0027s and severe obsessive compulsive disorder.The convert left his middle-class home in Oxford to become one of IS\u0027 most notorious recruits before his eventual capture.Now, after languishing in prison for two years, Letts said that he regretted becoming the poster boy for Islamic extremism.He said: That\u0027s one of the things that I regret I realised that me coming had a lot more meaning than a Syrian becoming ISIS.Jack Letts in Kurdish jailSpeaking about his time in solitary confinement, he said: You wouldn\u0027t be able to sit with me like this. You\u0027d say I\u0027m insane.  Letts faces being barred from returning to the UK under rules that allow Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, to strip him of his citizenship provided it would not make him stateless.   I\u0027ve repented from what I did, and it\u0027s not important in a sort of legal sense, but that\u0027s why I left. I realized what I did was wrong, religiously and also in a moral sense, he added.There\u0027s a feeling of stress and there\u0027s a feeling of regret. Regret without result. ... we\u0027re just being left like dogs. Cyclist thanks well-wishers for helping with £100,000 legal bill after he collided with woman looking at phoneForeign cannabis firms set up shop in UK hoping the drug will be legalised for recreational useBoris Johnson renews commitment to leave the EU on October 31 as he insists he will not \u0026#39bottle\u0026#39 BrexitSuzy Lamplugh may have used \u0026#39Mr Kipper\u0026#39 as a cover storyBeecham House, episode 1, review: An ambitious drama with a worryingly wooden heroNorthern Ireland\u0026#39s Brexit backstop \u0026#39can be made obsolete using existing technology within three years\u0026#39Nye Bevan relative was \u0026#39let down by NHS\u0026#39 before dying of lung cancerFacebook plans to encrypt messages will put children at increased risk of sexual abuse, warns NSPCC chiefComment: It\u0026#39s been three long years since we voted to Leave – which is why we can, must and will do so by October 31Spending watchdog launches investigation into MP with biggest expenses bill in ParliamentBoris Johnson still planning to live with Carrie Symonds in Downing Street despite rowCharles Dickens was \u0026#39outraged\u0026#39 by cheap parodies which made Victorian publisher a fortuneBritish tennis player with only six fingers wins Wimbledon wildcardHollywood comedy in decline as Netflix takes overBoris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedErdogan\u0026#39s ruling party loses Istanbul election in major blow to Turkish presidentUkraine urges Council of Europe not to lift Russia banJihadi Jack feels \u0026#39guilty\u0026#39 for his parents\u0026#39 convictionCzechs turn out for biggest protests since the end of Communism Erdogan\u0026#39s party loses controversial re-run of Istanbul electionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"worlds ugliest dog 2019 competition pictures","story":"Puka prepares to compete in the 31st edition of the annual World\u0027s Ugliest Dog Contest at the Sonoma-Marin Fair in Petaluma, California, USACyclist thanks well-wishers for helping with £100,000 legal bill after he collided with woman looking at phoneForeign cannabis firms set up shop in UK hoping the drug will be legalised for recreational useBoris Johnson renews commitment to leave the EU on October 31 as he insists he will not \u0026#39bottle\u0026#39 BrexitSuzy Lamplugh may have used \u0026#39Mr Kipper\u0026#39 as a cover storyBeecham House, episode 1, review: An ambitious drama with a worryingly wooden heroNorthern Ireland\u0026#39s Brexit backstop \u0026#39can be made obsolete using existing technology within three years\u0026#39Nye Bevan relative was \u0026#39let down by NHS\u0026#39 before dying of lung cancerFacebook plans to encrypt messages will put children at increased risk of sexual abuse, warns NSPCC chiefSpending watchdog launches investigation into MP with biggest expenses bill in ParliamentComment: It\u0026#39s been three long years since we voted to Leave – which is why we can, must and will do so by October 31Boris Johnson still planning to live with Carrie Symonds in Downing Street despite rowCharles Dickens was \u0026#39outraged\u0026#39 by cheap parodies which made Victorian publisher a fortuneBritish tennis player with only six fingers wins Wimbledon wildcardHollywood comedy in decline as Netflix takes overBoris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedErdogan\u0026#39s ruling party loses Istanbul election in major blow to Turkish presidentUkraine urges Council of Europe not to lift Russia banJihadi Jack feels \u0026#39guilty\u0026#39 for his parents\u0026#39 convictionCzechs turn out for biggest protests since the end of Communism Erdogan\u0026#39s party loses controversial re-run of Istanbul electionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/20/TELEMMGLPICT000138214184_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqC_LLCXkS_z-CZqgOMP7Be9WPY3Z_26YLrAU_gL4_dbY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside jared kushners unravelling israeli palestinian peace","story":"Jared Kushner, Mr Trump’s son-in-law, has so far failed to get the two sides in the same room.When Donald Trump first met Kim Jong-un in Singapore last year, he showed the North Korean a breathless four-minute film trailer made especially for the occasion.

Louis Staples hears their testimony – one for each year that has passedClick to followThe Independent USOn 28 June 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn in New York City. Tucked in the centre of Greenwich Village – the city’s gay district – the bar had become accustomed to hostility from law enforcement officers, who would often forcibly remove customers and seize cash. This time, around 200 customers were tossed out onto the street. But the tables turned when the crowd turned on the police officers.At the time, sex acts between two men or two women were illegal in every US state apart from Illinois. If you were gay, you couldn’t work for the US government or the military. In New York, thousands were arrested each year in the city for “crimes against nature” and coming out as gay could cost a person their licence in law and medicine.The Stonewall riots were not the beginning of the LGBT+ rights movement. But their impact was felt across the western world, galvanising a generation to fight for change. As that fight continues, 50 LGBT+ people tell us what Stonewall means to them.Created with Sketch.50 years of Stonewall: 50 LGBT+ people on what it means to them Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.‘When I heard about Stonewall, I remember feeling just like the famous line in the movie Network – I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more. Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist. That’s what the people at the Stonewall Inn did that fateful night in 1969. They resisted arrest and the status quo because they knew that their right to love and exist was equal to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.’‘Growing up I just did not see myself reflected within the history books. But when I found out that it was Marsh P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two transgender women of colour, who kicked off the Stonewall riots which lead to the gay rights movement... If filled me with pride.’‘I think perhaps the most glorious fact of the Stonewall riots is that it was the queens, the camp, glitzy queens who saw off the police that night in Greenwich Village. Years of mockery in the streets, being jostled, spat at, arrested and pushed off the sidewalk had toughened them up.’‘Trans women of colour have always stood at the forefront of this movement. Some try to erase the legacies but it’s still apparent in today’s climate that trans women are as bold as ever.’‘I am eternally grateful to those who fought for the recognition of gay identity at a time when society saw it only in crude sexual terms. Stonewall was about the freedom to love without fear.’850 Ruth Hunt, CEO of Stonewall‘We named ourselves after this historic moment and we continue to honour those involved by naming the meeting rooms in our London office after some of the leaders, including a lesbian woman of colour called Storme DeLarverie and two trans women of colour, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson.’950 Rikki Beadle-Blair, creator and performer‘I put my heart and soul into the script for Stonewall. And they’re all there: the butches, the fems, the blacks and hiics and whites. The middle-class activists. The street queens. The homeless queer kids. And they are still here, with us in every battle we still have to fight.’‘It laid the foundation for all the campaigns for LGBT+ equality that followed: against Section 28, for an equal age of consent, for equal access to services, for equal marriage, for justice around the world in the face of hostility and violence and bigotry.’‘The Stonewall riots were the spark that galvanised the LGBT+ community to organise in support for our rights. From homosexuality being a criminal offence, to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer.’1250 Shon Faye, writer and comedian‘While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.’‘Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.’1450 Tamal Ray, baker and doctor‘Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do.’‘In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health.’‘Those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard-won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law.  Prejudice persists. The fight continues.’1750 Shahmir Sanni, whistleblower and digital strategist‘In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on BAME sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us.’1850 Travis Alabanza, performer and activist‘It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory - but always in practice, on the streets, together.’‘The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and others have been carried though time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve.’2050 Michael Cashman, politician, actor and co-founder of Stonewall‘For me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel‘s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community.’‘It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.’‘I was born in the year of the Stonewall riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. Its a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are.’‘Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge, so that our heroes are never forgotten.’‘Trans people, especially trans women of colour, need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.’2550 Lea DeLaria, actor and comedian‘That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.’‘Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.’‘We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour - especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei.’2850 Phillip Picardi , journalist and editor-in-chief of OUT magazine‘This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.’‘On that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said no to state-sanctioned police brutality.’‘A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks. It serves to push back even harder and negate the strides we have already made.’3150 Jide Macaulay, pastor and activist‘As a black African British gay Christian living with HIV, it’s a reminder of the continuous fight for inclusion, liberation and ersity, to be respected for who I am and who I love.’Pride in LondonYouTube‘Will those corporations be aligned with us once the parade inevitably turns back to a protest?’‘Stonewall was the founding legend that we all learn from and we must stand tall as one community and one voice so we can pave the way for the new generations.’‘Trump and other emerging nationalists worldwide tend to hold a dim view of gay people. So we must our fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.’‘News that there is to be a straight pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s June 28 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence.’‘As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969.’3750 Jake Graf, actor and writer‘When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour.’3850 Lisa Power, co-founder of Stonewall‘We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot.’3950 Matthew Todd, author and journalist‘When a lesbian, we think Stormé DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme – did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me.’‘The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we\u0027ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away.’4150 Joseph Galliano, CEO and co-founder of the Queer Britain Museum‘Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.’‘It\u0027s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles.’4350 Glynn Fussel, performer and creator‘I\u0027m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don\u0027t have the rights that we have. Every single day we should remember the fights that came before us.’Sink the Pink‘Small towns now celebrate their LGBT citizens and the police are no longer hostile. That is progress of which we should all be proud.’‘What matters most to me about Stonewall was that it was one protest of many, one moment in time across decades of rebellion, building community, making our mark.’4650 Andrew Lumsden, journalist and activist‘The uprising brought us the word “gay”. When it crossed the Atlantic to us in 1970 as the Gay Liberation Front, which I promptly joined, none of us had ever before used the word in the sense of sexual orientation. And I\u0027m glad we did.’‘The stonewall riots were not only a moment in time and history, but a real signal that we are not a community that is to stay quiet and remain silenced.’‘However we should remember that there are so many stories of queer join, pain, struggle and victory out there to be discovered, if we take the time to look for them.’‘While many of us feel safe and accepted, Pride is about remembering that there are still people in the world who don’t. Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.’5050 Carrie Lyell, journalist and editor-in-chief of DIVA magazine‘What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’‘When I heard about Stonewall, I remember feeling just like the famous line in the movie Network – I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more. Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist. That’s what the people at the Stonewall Inn did that fateful night in 1969. They resisted arrest and the status quo because they knew that their right to love and exist was equal to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.’‘Growing up I just did not see myself reflected within the history books.

Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.’5050 Carrie Lyell, journalist and editor-in-chief of DIVA magazine‘What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’I was not as closely in tune with the community, or myself, in 1969 as I am today. I was in England playing at Wimbledon and being geographically removed from the news was a factor. While there was some limited media coverage, in those days the news travelled faster by word of mouth in an underground manner. Eventually the Stonewall uprising evolved into the origin of the modern gay movement.When I heard about Stonewall, I remember feeling just like the famous line in the movie Network – “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore.” Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now. The Stonewall riots gave so many the courage to finally be their authentic selves.There was so much that led up to that night, to those queer people fighting back, and so the legacy of the uprising, for me, is the people. What we’ve seen since then, as queer people of colour, is the erasure of our contributions, the minimising of our experiences and the silencing of our voices.I think in asking us to look back, we may be wondering where it went wrong – the point of ergence from what mattered for all of us to what was beneficial for a few. In that spirit, I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.Resist. That’s what the people at the Stonewall Inn did that fateful night in 1969. They resisted arrest and the status quo because they knew that their right to love and exist was equal to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. We must continue to resist what we know is wrong by speaking up with our voices, votes and dollars, and sometimes by acting up. We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to those who can’t help themselves, and we owe it to those who paved the yellow brick road from 1969 to 2019.Growing up I just did not see myself reflected within the history books. But when I found out that it was Marsh P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two transgender women of colour, who kicked off the Stonewall riots which lead to the gay rights movement it filled me with pride. It made me realise the importance of being educated about what our communities have been through, to seek out information ourselves because the reality is that our stories are so often whitewashed, erased or appropriated. We have always been here and I’m so glad that the trans community are finally getting our dues, even if there is still so far left to go.I think perhaps the most glorious fact of the Stonewall riots is that it was the queens, the camp, glitzy queens, who saw off the police that night in Greenwich Village. Years of mockery in the streets, being jostled, spat at, arrested and pushed off the sidewalk had toughened them up. They were the ones – stereotypes and cliches to the outside world and shamefully disowned by plenty of gay people back then too – who finally stood up and cried “ENOUGH”, and for that the whole world, not just the LGBT+ world, owes them a debt. Got it, girls!Trans women of colour have always stood at the forefront of this movement. Some try to erase the legacies but it’s still apparent in today’s climate that trans women are as bold as ever. Stonewall to me represents courage, and the willingness to stand in our power for unity, and equality.I am eternally grateful to those who fought for the recognition of gay identity at a time when society saw it only in crude sexual terms. Stonewall was about the freedom to love without fear. We can honour the bravery of those who fought tirelessly for our community by continuing their work, because it’s too easy to become complacent, to think that the job is done. It isn’t.In many countries, any act that expresses or signals same-sex attraction will lead to your death. And whilst LGBT+ people have greater legal protection than ever in the UK, there are still battles to be won, views to be challenged. We can start by standing up to anyone who tries to reintroduce anything that remotely resembles Section 28. Recent comments made by Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey are cause for alarm.The Stonewall uprising was a watershed moment that changed the course of our history and sparked the modern LGBT+ rights movement. The erse coalition of LGBT+ people that led the uprising showed the power that comes when we stand together and fight for the equality of every LGBT+ person. We named ourselves after this historic moment and we continue to honour those involved by naming the meeting rooms in our London office after some of the leaders, including a lesbian woman of colour called Storme DeLarverie and two trans women of colour, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson.Many of those people at the uprising were part of groups who continue to exist at the margins of our community, and for whom Pride isn’t yet a celebration but an act of defiance. We owe it to those who came before us to take on Pride’s spirit of protest to redouble our efforts to make the world a better place for every LGBT+ person.Creator and performer In 1978, when I was 17, I saw an incredible performance at the Ovalhouse theatre’s lesbian and gay cabaret evening. An actor strode centre-stage in full drag and in a broad New York accent started telling us how eight years before the queens, hustlers and street dykes of the Stonewall bar in Greenwich Village had fought back against some violent, corrupt and abusive New York cops and launched the final civil rights rebellion of the Sixties. The crowd of radical queers were ided. Some cheered. And many, to my amazement and confusion, hissed and booed loudly.Years later, I created a one-person show. I made it about someone who got caught up in the Stonewall riots. This got me the job writing the 1995 movie Stonewall. I put my heart and soul into the script for Stonewall. And they’re all there: the butches, the fems, the blacks and hiics and whites. The middle-class activists. The street queens. The homeless queer kids. And they are still here, with us in every battle we still have to fight. And we must honour them repeatedly. Year after year. We must never betray or dismiss them. We must never forget how we got this far. We must never forget who we are.Britain’s first openly gay male MPStonewall was the moment when the gay community decided to fight back, not to take things lying down any longer, and to assert some pride in their identity. As a result, it was a completely decisive moment for all of us. It laid the foundation for all the campaigns for LGBT+ equality that followed: against Section 28, for an equal age of consent, for equal access to services, for equal marriage, for justice around the world in the face of hostility and violence and bigotry. We stand on Stonewall’s shoulders.The Stonewall riots were the spark that galvanised the LGBT+ community to organise in support for our rights. From homosexuality being a criminal offence to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer. The truth is, the LGBT+ community has always been judged by the standards of a very heterosexual and binary world.We have been treated as abnormal and dangerous purely because we do not conform to how society expects us to be. Where we have made progress, we see how much of a celebration Pride is. However, we must never forget it is a protest first and foremost. Our existence in this world is inherently political. We must never stop celebrating, or fighting for our rights.Writer and comedian Stonewall functions as a kind of origin myth or oral history that gets retold, constantly, with different emphases. These varying accounts of the past always reveal a lot about the politics of the LGBT+ community retelling them. For example, 15 years ago it was very common to read that the riots were fuelled by gay men’s grief over the death of Judy Garland, now the role of trans people or the lesbian Storme Delarverie is more central. While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.The most important thing about the Stonewall riots was that they sparked the formation of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and prompted the first Pride marches. This LGBT+ revolution, which began in the US, quickly spread worldwide. I was part of London GLF. Instead of pleading for reform or seeking equality within the status quo, we demanded the transformation of straight society.GLF set the agenda for all the gains of the last five decades in the UK. Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.Baker and doctorI’m not a confrontational person by nature so I often think about the riots and what I would have done if I’d been around back then. Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of Section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do. Remembering the riots is so important to me. Not just as a bit of history but as a constant reminder of the need to be brave. That doesn’t always feel easy, or even safe, but it’s still necessary.The Stonewall riots are a reminder that our rights and freedoms were not given to us as acts of charity and goodwill, but through struggle and sacrifice. The gay and trans people who led this iconic event are giants on whose shoulders we stand – but their spirit needs to be emulated. In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health services LGBT+ people disproportionately depend on to defending LGBT+ inclusive education. We have so far to go still.Watching gay people assert themselves in the face of authority – and being supported and defended by straight friends and allies across Greenwich Village – was a real turning point in gay history. That’s why so many people cite the Stonewall riots as the start of the LGBT+ movement’s campaign for equal rights.Every advance we have made in law and in public consciousness across the western world is built upon those foundations. But those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law. Prejudice persists. The fight continues.Our community is inherently righteous, our community is inherently good. There is a reason LGBT+ people are 20 times more likely to be activists than their heterosexual counterparts – wanting to make the world a better place is in our blood. But conforming to a society built on social capital and influence in the age of the internet has led us down a path where our idea of liberation is being in an advert for a company that has consistently undermined people of colour or other marginalised communities, not in social justice.In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on Bame sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us. It’s been 50 years since a black trans woman made the first move in what would lead to one of the most defining moments in our history. I hope in the next 50 years our community reaffirms its intrinsically black, feminist values and responds with ever more passion to a growing climate of hate, homophobia and racism.Performer and activistThe riots remind me, especially in times of great uncertainty, that our community has always been resourceful, survivors and fighters. It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory – but always in practice, on the streets, together. For me, the riots remind me of the daily resilience queerness has in its history and presence, and I feel now more than ever – we need to remember that!What astounds me about the Stonewall riots is how rich the history of that moment is without the institutional support of well-funded organisations, or even the government for a long time. The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Riviera and others have been carried through time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve. This moment was about human beings and their right to life, love and liberty. Stonewall doesn’t allow us to forget the humans behind the moment, and so we continue to progress.Politician, actor and co-founder of StonewallI was 18 at the time and I don’t even remember it being reported in the British media. Certainly not as a riot started in a gay bar. But for me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel’s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community. When we should have been given support and succour right wing seized it as an opportunity to drive us underground. It was the moment we decided to fight back – and win. The fight continues.Today, the legacy of Stonewall is a community that fought across gender identity, sexual orientation, race and class. It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.I was born in the year of the Stonewall Riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. It’s a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are. This is our queer history. But not only is the fight not yet won, but the small gains that we have made are also unevenly distributed. There may be spaces of celebration and expression in urban centres, but until every queer person in every rural community across this country can feel a valued part of society, we have to keep fighting. Together. For all of us.I am ashamed to say that before starting as the BBC’s first LGBT+ correspondent, I did not know the full story behind the Stonewall riots. Of course, I had seen the infamous film, but only after visiting New York last month, and soaking up the past, did I discover the truth. I am so sad that I grew up searching for queer role models who were also people of colour, and meanwhile I was missing out on some incredible legends... legends who actually kickstarted the modern LGBT+ rights movement through their actions 50 years ago.Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge so that our heroes are never forgotten.As we celebrate 50 years since Stonewall, I think it’s important we remember who was at the forefront of the Stonewall riots (and in turn at the forefront of the LGBT+ liberation movement) it was trans women of colour who fought for all of us. Google the trans murder epidemic (that predominantly affects trans women of colour) that is taking place right now, and it is worse than ever. Trans people, especially trans women of colour need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.First openly gay referee in the professional football leaguesThe Stonewall riots’ legacy for me is that we should never give up or become complacent. Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.We are not done until everyone can live and love regardless of their sexual orientation, regardless of their gender, regardless of their race, colour or creed. For until we can all be who we are born to be, the fight for equality must continue and we will not be silenced.The Stonewall uprising was about LGBT+ people standing up for each other, together. We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour – especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei. Working together is how we started to fight back, and it’s by working together that we will end this fight, too.Journalist, editor-in-chief of “Out” magazineStonewall, for me, is a reminder and a wake-up call. This year much has been said or done to retroactively honour our trans ancestors (like Marsha P Johnson or Sylvia Rivera) for their contributions to the movement and to that fateful night in 1969. But as recent events in America and the UK have shown, we are still so far from liberation for the trans community.Whether that’s the coordinated, insidious attack on trans iniduals like Munroe Bergdorf by the UK media, the cruel murders of black trans women like Ashanti Carmon and Zoe Spears or the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict trans folks from access to housing, healthcare, or public service, we’ve got a long way to go. This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.Stonewall has become a beacon or totem of LGBT+ emancipation. So much has been said and we can’t know precisely what happened. I think we can extrapolate that, on that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said “NO” to state-sanctioned police brutality. That sense of unity is needed as much today as it was in 1969 as our rights and freedoms are continually debated and challenged.I grew up in a country that inherited Victorian colonial laws criminalising consenting same-sex sexual relationships. Anachronistic as they are, they are in fact very dangerous and extremely cruel and inhumane. The Stonewall riot was a pivotal point in the global gay liberation movement. It galvanized the LGBT+ movement globally and many countries have moved positively forward. However, there are many countries such as mine, Sri Lanka, that seem to be sinking more into the abyss of homophobia and intolerance.A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks. It serves to push back even harder and negate the strides we have already made. Now, more than ever, we need to be vigilant and continue fighting to win our dignity and our liberation.Pastor and activistFifty years is a long time in any struggle. As the world celebrates the anniversary of Stonewall it’s incumbent to reflect on what it means for this and future generations. So much more needs to be done as many LGBT+ communities are still left behind without the protection of the law. Personally, as a black African British gay Christian living with HIV, it’s a reminder of the continuous fight for inclusion, liberation and ersity, to be respected for who I am and who I love.Since the first stiletto was thrown at Stonewall we’ve seen a slow assimilation politic led by an organisation of the same name in the UK. Gone are the days of yesteryear resistance, rebellion and difference – we now live in an age of rainbow washing, corporate gay-for-pay and the legacy of a largely depoliticised community, a community that is now facing daily aggression, abuse and violence in public space, online and across the media. We’re fighting for survival, again – will that sponsored float save the day? Will those corporations be aligned with us once the parade inevitably turns back to a protest?We have fought the fight and paved the way and Stonewall was the founding legend that we all learn from and we must stand tall as one community and one voice so we can pave the way for the new generation. At the same time we must remember those who fought the fight for us and let’s raise the rainbow flag and light a candle as their remembrance.The Stonewall riots were a response to a physical attack from police. Fast forward to today. Nowadays we have many more rights, and police don’t openly harass our watering holes. So I wonder what we’re currently fighting for? On social media, I recently posted about the passage of an LGBT+ equality bill in the house. A few people liked my post but no one shared it.Are we so bored with the quest for our own rights? Or do we need another attack like Stonewall or a tragedy like the Aids epidemic to bring back our fighting spirit? Trump and other emerging nationalists worldwide tend to hold a dim view of gay people. So we must fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.News that there is to be a straight Pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s 28 June 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence. What is now a party started as a riot. After two women were attacked on a London bus for refusing to kiss, we must never forget that we may need to riot again sooner than we think.As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969. But we still live in a country where 68 per cent of LGBT+ people are afraid to hold hands in the street and anti-LGBT+ hate crime has more than doubled in the last five years.Because of Stonewall, I will soon address UK Pride as the first “out” leader of a political party in England. And because of Stonewall, I know that if we continue to fight for better, we will get there.Actor and writerAs a writer who was a part of the London lesbian community pre-transition for over a decade, and who has always identified as queer, I have always been interested in our history as a global community. The Stonewall riots are almost folkloric for us. When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour, standing up to bigoted and hateful law enforcement officers, determined to hurt LGBT+ folk.While there is still a long way to go, the significance of the events at the Stonewall Inn that day in 1969 still resonate powerfully today, and as recent media coverage sadly shows, the battle against homophobia, biphobia and transphobia is not yet won.Co-founder of StonewallThe important thing about Stonewall 50 years ago is not who threw the first brick. It’s who stayed to build the community of resistance to the injustices that LGBT+ people faced. Trans and bi people, lesbians, gay men and others rejected by society all got stuck in and changed their world. We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot. We need to keep fighting, for all the LGBT+ people still imprisoned, beaten, sacked, abused because of who they love. We are stronger together.Author and journalistBecause of erasure of people of colour and trans people, Stonewall sometimes highlights the isions in our community. But researching my book, Pride, what I found incredibly moving was that Stonewall was really about a community coming together. When a lesbian, we think Storme DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme, did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me. That sense of unity is needed now more than ever.When I think about the Stonewall riots, and the history of heroic activism in the LGBT+ community, it reminds me never to get complacent. The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we’ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away. Our community, more than ever before, needs to harness the political energy of our ancestors and keep fighting.CEO and co-founder, Queer Britain Museum There have been many accounts about what started the riots: the hot summer the recent death of Judy Garland yet another raid. Truth is buried in myth. What is true is that the Stonewall Inn’s customers, a mixture of marginalised communities – transgender, gay and lesbian people, sex workers, people of colour – were heartily sick of the daily harassment they faced and finally snapped.It wasn’t the start of LGBT+ campaigning, but the moment it angrily took to the streets. Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent-up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.Stonewall is an important reminder of how integral black and brown queer folks have been in the fight for liberation. It’s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles. As much as Stonewall has become a celebration, we still have a very long way to go and stand on the shoulders of all who fought so hard on those nights.Performer and creatorFifty years is a very short amount of time and a lot has changed. But we’ve really only just begun to show the rest of the world what fundamental human rights are and how far we can come in such a short space of time. I’m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don’t have the rights that we have. Every single day we should remember the fights that came before us. That’s why I’ll always be involved in as many Pride celebrations. Not because I want to, but because I have to. As long as I can live my life to the fullest, I have an obligation to fight for the people that don’t.Fifty years ago LGBT+ people fought back against police intimidation. It was the catalyst for LGBT+ people to gather publicly to demand equality and justice, and it resonated around the world. In small towns those of us who knew we were different learnt that we could go to cities and find a community. Fifty years on we are still marching. Pride in New York or London gives hope to those living in countries which criminalise homosexuality. Small towns now celebrate their LGBT+ citizens and the police are no longer hostile. That is progress of which we should all be proud.What matters most to me about Stonewall was that it was one protest of many, one moment in time across decades of rebellion, building community, making our mark.Journalist and activistI was 27, born in Surrey and living in London and working as a journalist for The Times newspaper when the Stonewall uprising staggered the cops of New York. I’d been late understanding I was queer, as so many of us LGBT+ people were in those days, only realising it for sure at 25. The uprising brought us the word “gay”. When it crossed the Atlantic to us in 1970 as the Gay Liberation Front, which I promptly joined, none of us had ever before used the word in the sense of sexual orientation. And I’m glad we did.The Stonewall riots were not only a moment in time and history but a real signal that we are not a community that is to stay quiet and remain silenced. The power and strength trans women of colour, and queer people showed at that moment is something we should all carry with us through our lives as it’s got us to where we are now and will continue to move us forward.To me, Stonewall is a great focal point and moment to be proud of in LGBT+ history, especially when so much of our history was not or could not be recorded, or if it was, sometimes destroyed. However, we should remember that there are so many stories of queer pain, struggle and victory out there to be discovered, if we take the time to look for them. Knowing where we came from helps us to work out where we’re going.Pride is as important now as it was when the first brick was thrown at Stonewall. While many of us feel safe and accepted, Pride is about remembering that there are still people in the world who don’t. Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.Journalist, editor-in-chief of “DIVA” magazineWhen I first came out, I knew very little about Stonewall. I knew very little about queer history generally. It was never on the curriculum, and certainly not discussed around the dinner table. What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don’t need to hunt as I did.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Louis Staples hears their testimony – one for each year that has passedClick to followThe Independent USOn 28 June 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn in New York City. Tucked in the centre of Greenwich Village – the city’s gay district – the bar had become accustomed to hostility from law enforcement officers, who would often forcibly remove customers and seize cash. This time, around 200 customers were tossed out onto the street. But the tables turned when the crowd turned on the police officers.At the time, sex acts between two men or two women were illegal in every US state apart from Illinois. If you were gay, you couldn’t work for the US government or the military. In New York, thousands were arrested each year in the city for “crimes against nature” and coming out as gay could cost a person their licence in law and medicine.The Stonewall riots were not the beginning of the LGBT+ rights movement. But their impact was felt across the western world, galvanising a generation to fight for change. As that fight continues, 50 LGBT+ people tell us what Stonewall means to them.Created with Sketch.50 years of Stonewall: 50 LGBT+ people on what it means to them Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.‘When I heard about Stonewall, I remember feeling just like the famous line in the movie Network – I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more. Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist. That’s what the people at the Stonewall Inn did that fateful night in 1969. They resisted arrest and the status quo because they knew that their right to love and exist was equal to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.’‘Growing up I just did not see myself reflected within the history books. But when I found out that it was Marsh P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two transgender women of colour, who kicked off the Stonewall riots which lead to the gay rights movement... If filled me with pride.’‘I think perhaps the most glorious fact of the Stonewall riots is that it was the queens, the camp, glitzy queens who saw off the police that night in Greenwich Village. Years of mockery in the streets, being jostled, spat at, arrested and pushed off the sidewalk had toughened them up.’‘Trans women of colour have always stood at the forefront of this movement.

From homosexuality being a criminal offence, to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer.’1250 Shon Faye, writer and comedian‘While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.’‘Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.’1450 Tamal Ray, baker and doctor‘Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do.’‘In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health.’‘Those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard-won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law.  Prejudice persists. The fight continues.’1750 Shahmir Sanni, whistleblower and digital strategist‘In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on BAME sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us.’1850 Travis Alabanza, performer and activist‘It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory - but always in practice, on the streets, together.’‘The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and others have been carried though time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve.’2050 Michael Cashman, politician, actor and co-founder of Stonewall‘For me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel‘s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community.’‘It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.’‘I was born in the year of the Stonewall riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. Its a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are.’‘Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge, so that our heroes are never forgotten.’‘Trans people, especially trans women of colour, need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.’2550 Lea DeLaria, actor and comedian‘That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.’‘Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.’‘We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour - especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei.’2850 Phillip Picardi , journalist and editor-in-chief of OUT magazine‘This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.’‘On that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said no to state-sanctioned police brutality.’‘A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks.

So we must our fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.’‘News that there is to be a straight pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s June 28 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence.’‘As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969.’3750 Jake Graf, actor and writer‘When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour.’3850 Lisa Power, co-founder of Stonewall‘We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot.’3950 Matthew Todd, author and journalist‘When a lesbian, we think Stormé DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme – did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me.’‘The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we\u0027ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away.’4150 Joseph Galliano, CEO and co-founder of the Queer Britain Museum‘Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.’‘It\u0027s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles.’4350 Glynn Fussel, performer and creator‘I\u0027m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don\u0027t have the rights that we have.

So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’I was not as closely in tune with the community, or myself, in 1969 as I am today. I was in England playing at Wimbledon and being geographically removed from the news was a factor. While there was some limited media coverage, in those days the news travelled faster by word of mouth in an underground manner. Eventually the Stonewall uprising evolved into the origin of the modern gay movement.When I heard about Stonewall, I remember feeling just like the famous line in the movie Network – “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore.” Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now. The Stonewall riots gave so many the courage to finally be their authentic selves.There was so much that led up to that night, to those queer people fighting back, and so the legacy of the uprising, for me, is the people. What we’ve seen since then, as queer people of colour, is the erasure of our contributions, the minimising of our experiences and the silencing of our voices.I think in asking us to look back, we may be wondering where it went wrong – the point of ergence from what mattered for all of us to what was beneficial for a few. In that spirit, I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.Resist. That’s what the people at the Stonewall Inn did that fateful night in 1969. They resisted arrest and the status quo because they knew that their right to love and exist was equal to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. We must continue to resist what we know is wrong by speaking up with our voices, votes and dollars, and sometimes by acting up. We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to those who can’t help themselves, and we owe it to those who paved the yellow brick road from 1969 to 2019.Growing up I just did not see myself reflected within the history books. But when I found out that it was Marsh P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two transgender women of colour, who kicked off the Stonewall riots which lead to the gay rights movement it filled me with pride. It made me realise the importance of being educated about what our communities have been through, to seek out information ourselves because the reality is that our stories are so often whitewashed, erased or appropriated. We have always been here and I’m so glad that the trans community are finally getting our dues, even if there is still so far left to go.I think perhaps the most glorious fact of the Stonewall riots is that it was the queens, the camp, glitzy queens, who saw off the police that night in Greenwich Village. Years of mockery in the streets, being jostled, spat at, arrested and pushed off the sidewalk had toughened them up. They were the ones – stereotypes and cliches to the outside world and shamefully disowned by plenty of gay people back then too – who finally stood up and cried “ENOUGH”, and for that the whole world, not just the LGBT+ world, owes them a debt. Got it, girls!Trans women of colour have always stood at the forefront of this movement. Some try to erase the legacies but it’s still apparent in today’s climate that trans women are as bold as ever. Stonewall to me represents courage, and the willingness to stand in our power for unity, and equality.I am eternally grateful to those who fought for the recognition of gay identity at a time when society saw it only in crude sexual terms. Stonewall was about the freedom to love without fear. We can honour the bravery of those who fought tirelessly for our community by continuing their work, because it’s too easy to become complacent, to think that the job is done. It isn’t.In many countries, any act that expresses or signals same-sex attraction will lead to your death. And whilst LGBT+ people have greater legal protection than ever in the UK, there are still battles to be won, views to be challenged. We can start by standing up to anyone who tries to reintroduce anything that remotely resembles Section 28. Recent comments made by Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey are cause for alarm.The Stonewall uprising was a watershed moment that changed the course of our history and sparked the modern LGBT+ rights movement. The erse coalition of LGBT+ people that led the uprising showed the power that comes when we stand together and fight for the equality of every LGBT+ person. We named ourselves after this historic moment and we continue to honour those involved by naming the meeting rooms in our London office after some of the leaders, including a lesbian woman of colour called Storme DeLarverie and two trans women of colour, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson.Many of those people at the uprising were part of groups who continue to exist at the margins of our community, and for whom Pride isn’t yet a celebration but an act of defiance. We owe it to those who came before us to take on Pride’s spirit of protest to redouble our efforts to make the world a better place for every LGBT+ person.Creator and performer In 1978, when I was 17, I saw an incredible performance at the Ovalhouse theatre’s lesbian and gay cabaret evening. An actor strode centre-stage in full drag and in a broad New York accent started telling us how eight years before the queens, hustlers and street dykes of the Stonewall bar in Greenwich Village had fought back against some violent, corrupt and abusive New York cops and launched the final civil rights rebellion of the Sixties. The crowd of radical queers were ided. Some cheered. And many, to my amazement and confusion, hissed and booed loudly.Years later, I created a one-person show. I made it about someone who got caught up in the Stonewall riots. This got me the job writing the 1995 movie Stonewall. I put my heart and soul into the script for Stonewall. And they’re all there: the butches, the fems, the blacks and hiics and whites. The middle-class activists. The street queens. The homeless queer kids. And they are still here, with us in every battle we still have to fight. And we must honour them repeatedly. Year after year. We must never betray or dismiss them. We must never forget how we got this far. We must never forget who we are.Britain’s first openly gay male MPStonewall was the moment when the gay community decided to fight back, not to take things lying down any longer, and to assert some pride in their identity. As a result, it was a completely decisive moment for all of us. It laid the foundation for all the campaigns for LGBT+ equality that followed: against Section 28, for an equal age of consent, for equal access to services, for equal marriage, for justice around the world in the face of hostility and violence and bigotry. We stand on Stonewall’s shoulders.The Stonewall riots were the spark that galvanised the LGBT+ community to organise in support for our rights. From homosexuality being a criminal offence to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer. The truth is, the LGBT+ community has always been judged by the standards of a very heterosexual and binary world.We have been treated as abnormal and dangerous purely because we do not conform to how society expects us to be. Where we have made progress, we see how much of a celebration Pride is. However, we must never forget it is a protest first and foremost. Our existence in this world is inherently political. We must never stop celebrating, or fighting for our rights.Writer and comedian Stonewall functions as a kind of origin myth or oral history that gets retold, constantly, with different emphases. These varying accounts of the past always reveal a lot about the politics of the LGBT+ community retelling them. For example, 15 years ago it was very common to read that the riots were fuelled by gay men’s grief over the death of Judy Garland, now the role of trans people or the lesbian Storme Delarverie is more central. While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.The most important thing about the Stonewall riots was that they sparked the formation of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and prompted the first Pride marches. This LGBT+ revolution, which began in the US, quickly spread worldwide. I was part of London GLF. Instead of pleading for reform or seeking equality within the status quo, we demanded the transformation of straight society.GLF set the agenda for all the gains of the last five decades in the UK. Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.Baker and doctorI’m not a confrontational person by nature so I often think about the riots and what I would have done if I’d been around back then. Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of Section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do. Remembering the riots is so important to me. Not just as a bit of history but as a constant reminder of the need to be brave. That doesn’t always feel easy, or even safe, but it’s still necessary.The Stonewall riots are a reminder that our rights and freedoms were not given to us as acts of charity and goodwill, but through struggle and sacrifice. The gay and trans people who led this iconic event are giants on whose shoulders we stand – but their spirit needs to be emulated. In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health services LGBT+ people disproportionately depend on to defending LGBT+ inclusive education. We have so far to go still.Watching gay people assert themselves in the face of authority – and being supported and defended by straight friends and allies across Greenwich Village – was a real turning point in gay history. That’s why so many people cite the Stonewall riots as the start of the LGBT+ movement’s campaign for equal rights.Every advance we have made in law and in public consciousness across the western world is built upon those foundations. But those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law. Prejudice persists. The fight continues.Our community is inherently righteous, our community is inherently good. There is a reason LGBT+ people are 20 times more likely to be activists than their heterosexual counterparts – wanting to make the world a better place is in our blood. But conforming to a society built on social capital and influence in the age of the internet has led us down a path where our idea of liberation is being in an advert for a company that has consistently undermined people of colour or other marginalised communities, not in social justice.In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on Bame sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us. It’s been 50 years since a black trans woman made the first move in what would lead to one of the most defining moments in our history. I hope in the next 50 years our community reaffirms its intrinsically black, feminist values and responds with ever more passion to a growing climate of hate, homophobia and racism.Performer and activistThe riots remind me, especially in times of great uncertainty, that our community has always been resourceful, survivors and fighters. It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory – but always in practice, on the streets, together. For me, the riots remind me of the daily resilience queerness has in its history and presence, and I feel now more than ever – we need to remember that!What astounds me about the Stonewall riots is how rich the history of that moment is without the institutional support of well-funded organisations, or even the government for a long time. The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Riviera and others have been carried through time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve. This moment was about human beings and their right to life, love and liberty. Stonewall doesn’t allow us to forget the humans behind the moment, and so we continue to progress.Politician, actor and co-founder of StonewallI was 18 at the time and I don’t even remember it being reported in the British media. Certainly not as a riot started in a gay bar. But for me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel’s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community. When we should have been given support and succour right wing seized it as an opportunity to drive us underground. It was the moment we decided to fight back – and win. The fight continues.Today, the legacy of Stonewall is a community that fought across gender identity, sexual orientation, race and class. It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.I was born in the year of the Stonewall Riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. It’s a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are. This is our queer history. But not only is the fight not yet won, but the small gains that we have made are also unevenly distributed. There may be spaces of celebration and expression in urban centres, but until every queer person in every rural community across this country can feel a valued part of society, we have to keep fighting. Together. For all of us.I am ashamed to say that before starting as the BBC’s first LGBT+ correspondent, I did not know the full story behind the Stonewall riots. Of course, I had seen the infamous film, but only after visiting New York last month, and soaking up the past, did I discover the truth. I am so sad that I grew up searching for queer role models who were also people of colour, and meanwhile I was missing out on some incredible legends... legends who actually kickstarted the modern LGBT+ rights movement through their actions 50 years ago.Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge so that our heroes are never forgotten.As we celebrate 50 years since Stonewall, I think it’s important we remember who was at the forefront of the Stonewall riots (and in turn at the forefront of the LGBT+ liberation movement) it was trans women of colour who fought for all of us. Google the trans murder epidemic (that predominantly affects trans women of colour) that is taking place right now, and it is worse than ever. Trans people, especially trans women of colour need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.First openly gay referee in the professional football leaguesThe Stonewall riots’ legacy for me is that we should never give up or become complacent. Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.We are not done until everyone can live and love regardless of their sexual orientation, regardless of their gender, regardless of their race, colour or creed. For until we can all be who we are born to be, the fight for equality must continue and we will not be silenced.The Stonewall uprising was about LGBT+ people standing up for each other, together. We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour – especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei. Working together is how we started to fight back, and it’s by working together that we will end this fight, too.Journalist, editor-in-chief of “Out” magazineStonewall, for me, is a reminder and a wake-up call. This year much has been said or done to retroactively honour our trans ancestors (like Marsha P Johnson or Sylvia Rivera) for their contributions to the movement and to that fateful night in 1969. But as recent events in America and the UK have shown, we are still so far from liberation for the trans community.Whether that’s the coordinated, insidious attack on trans iniduals like Munroe Bergdorf by the UK media, the cruel murders of black trans women like Ashanti Carmon and Zoe Spears or the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict trans folks from access to housing, healthcare, or public service, we’ve got a long way to go. This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.Stonewall has become a beacon or totem of LGBT+ emancipation. So much has been said and we can’t know precisely what happened. I think we can extrapolate that, on that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said “NO” to state-sanctioned police brutality. That sense of unity is needed as much today as it was in 1969 as our rights and freedoms are continually debated and challenged.I grew up in a country that inherited Victorian colonial laws criminalising consenting same-sex sexual relationships. Anachronistic as they are, they are in fact very dangerous and extremely cruel and inhumane. The Stonewall riot was a pivotal point in the global gay liberation movement. It galvanized the LGBT+ movement globally and many countries have moved positively forward. However, there are many countries such as mine, Sri Lanka, that seem to be sinking more into the abyss of homophobia and intolerance.A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks. It serves to push back even harder and negate the strides we have already made. Now, more than ever, we need to be vigilant and continue fighting to win our dignity and our liberation.Pastor and activistFifty years is a long time in any struggle. As the world celebrates the anniversary of Stonewall it’s incumbent to reflect on what it means for this and future generations. So much more needs to be done as many LGBT+ communities are still left behind without the protection of the law. Personally, as a black African British gay Christian living with HIV, it’s a reminder of the continuous fight for inclusion, liberation and ersity, to be respected for who I am and who I love.Since the first stiletto was thrown at Stonewall we’ve seen a slow assimilation politic led by an organisation of the same name in the UK. Gone are the days of yesteryear resistance, rebellion and difference – we now live in an age of rainbow washing, corporate gay-for-pay and the legacy of a largely depoliticised community, a community that is now facing daily aggression, abuse and violence in public space, online and across the media. We’re fighting for survival, again – will that sponsored float save the day? Will those corporations be aligned with us once the parade inevitably turns back to a protest?We have fought the fight and paved the way and Stonewall was the founding legend that we all learn from and we must stand tall as one community and one voice so we can pave the way for the new generation. At the same time we must remember those who fought the fight for us and let’s raise the rainbow flag and light a candle as their remembrance.The Stonewall riots were a response to a physical attack from police. Fast forward to today. Nowadays we have many more rights, and police don’t openly harass our watering holes. So I wonder what we’re currently fighting for? On social media, I recently posted about the passage of an LGBT+ equality bill in the house. A few people liked my post but no one shared it.Are we so bored with the quest for our own rights? Or do we need another attack like Stonewall or a tragedy like the Aids epidemic to bring back our fighting spirit? Trump and other emerging nationalists worldwide tend to hold a dim view of gay people. So we must fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.News that there is to be a straight Pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s 28 June 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence. What is now a party started as a riot. After two women were attacked on a London bus for refusing to kiss, we must never forget that we may need to riot again sooner than we think.As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969. But we still live in a country where 68 per cent of LGBT+ people are afraid to hold hands in the street and anti-LGBT+ hate crime has more than doubled in the last five years.Because of Stonewall, I will soon address UK Pride as the first “out” leader of a political party in England. And because of Stonewall, I know that if we continue to fight for better, we will get there.Actor and writerAs a writer who was a part of the London lesbian community pre-transition for over a decade, and who has always identified as queer, I have always been interested in our history as a global community. The Stonewall riots are almost folkloric for us. When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour, standing up to bigoted and hateful law enforcement officers, determined to hurt LGBT+ folk.While there is still a long way to go, the significance of the events at the Stonewall Inn that day in 1969 still resonate powerfully today, and as recent media coverage sadly shows, the battle against homophobia, biphobia and transphobia is not yet won.Co-founder of StonewallThe important thing about Stonewall 50 years ago is not who threw the first brick. It’s who stayed to build the community of resistance to the injustices that LGBT+ people faced. Trans and bi people, lesbians, gay men and others rejected by society all got stuck in and changed their world. We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot. We need to keep fighting, for all the LGBT+ people still imprisoned, beaten, sacked, abused because of who they love. We are stronger together.Author and journalistBecause of erasure of people of colour and trans people, Stonewall sometimes highlights the isions in our community. But researching my book, Pride, what I found incredibly moving was that Stonewall was really about a community coming together. When a lesbian, we think Storme DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme, did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me. That sense of unity is needed now more than ever.When I think about the Stonewall riots, and the history of heroic activism in the LGBT+ community, it reminds me never to get complacent. The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we’ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away. Our community, more than ever before, needs to harness the political energy of our ancestors and keep fighting.CEO and co-founder, Queer Britain Museum There have been many accounts about what started the riots: the hot summer the recent death of Judy Garland yet another raid. Truth is buried in myth. What is true is that the Stonewall Inn’s customers, a mixture of marginalised communities – transgender, gay and lesbian people, sex workers, people of colour – were heartily sick of the daily harassment they faced and finally snapped.It wasn’t the start of LGBT+ campaigning, but the moment it angrily took to the streets. Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent-up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.Stonewall is an important reminder of how integral black and brown queer folks have been in the fight for liberation. It’s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles. As much as Stonewall has become a celebration, we still have a very long way to go and stand on the shoulders of all who fought so hard on those nights.Performer and creatorFifty years is a very short amount of time and a lot has changed. But we’ve really only just begun to show the rest of the world what fundamental human rights are and how far we can come in such a short space of time. I’m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don’t have the rights that we have. Every single day we should remember the fights that came before us. That’s why I’ll always be involved in as many Pride celebrations. Not because I want to, but because I have to. As long as I can live my life to the fullest, I have an obligation to fight for the people that don’t.Fifty years ago LGBT+ people fought back against police intimidation. It was the catalyst for LGBT+ people to gather publicly to demand equality and justice, and it resonated around the world. In small towns those of us who knew we were different learnt that we could go to cities and find a community. Fifty years on we are still marching. Pride in New York or London gives hope to those living in countries which criminalise homosexuality. Small towns now celebrate their LGBT+ citizens and the police are no longer hostile. That is progress of which we should all be proud.What matters most to me about Stonewall was that it was one protest of many, one moment in time across decades of rebellion, building community, making our mark.Journalist and activistI was 27, born in Surrey and living in London and working as a journalist for The Times newspaper when the Stonewall uprising staggered the cops of New York. I’d been late understanding I was queer, as so many of us LGBT+ people were in those days, only realising it for sure at 25. The uprising brought us the word “gay”. When it crossed the Atlantic to us in 1970 as the Gay Liberation Front, which I promptly joined, none of us had ever before used the word in the sense of sexual orientation. And I’m glad we did.The Stonewall riots were not only a moment in time and history but a real signal that we are not a community that is to stay quiet and remain silenced. The power and strength trans women of colour, and queer people showed at that moment is something we should all carry with us through our lives as it’s got us to where we are now and will continue to move us forward.To me, Stonewall is a great focal point and moment to be proud of in LGBT+ history, especially when so much of our history was not or could not be recorded, or if it was, sometimes destroyed. However, we should remember that there are so many stories of queer pain, struggle and victory out there to be discovered, if we take the time to look for them. Knowing where we came from helps us to work out where we’re going.Pride is as important now as it was when the first brick was thrown at Stonewall. While many of us feel safe and accepted, Pride is about remembering that there are still people in the world who don’t. Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.Journalist, editor-in-chief of “DIVA” magazineWhen I first came out, I knew very little about Stonewall. I knew very little about queer history generally. It was never on the curriculum, and certainly not discussed around the dinner table. What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don’t need to hunt as I did.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They feel Hunt is the ideal opponent.He voted Remain in , he has been in Cabinet throughout Theresa May’s premiership with its Brexit failures and he is a mild-mannered figure who struggles to impose himself on debates.One Boris backer jokes that they have never seen, “a more lop-sided two-horse race”.The Hunt campaign bristle at the idea that this is going to be a walkover.They believe he has a route to victory by playing on Tory members’ concerns about whether Boris can actually do the job of being PM.They also think they will do well with the large Scottish membership — Scots are twice as likely to be members of the Tory party than the English — and are planning an early campaign trip there.They expect to pick up the endorsement of Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.But for all Jeremy Hunt’s efforts to make this a contest, it is still Boris Johnson’s to lose. Of course, he could. He could make a spectacular gaffe or some scandal could blow up.Last night’s revelations of the screaming match at the flat he shares with his new partner shows the scrutiny that his le is going to come under.If he can get through the next fortnight without any major blunders, he’ll become Tory leader.Why  Because the postal votes go out from July  and most Tory members willthem within two days.As one Tory veteran explains: “A week after the ballots have gone out, it is too late to change anything.”I understand Boris will use the next weeks to set out his Brexit position in more detail.Those hoping to see him in full entertainer mode at these hustings will be disappointed. Instead, he intends to stick to the serious persona of the past few weeks.One of those preparing him for the month tells me that Tory members “know he can do Boris. They need to see him do Prime Minister.”This new, more serious approach won’t stop the attacks.Boris’s critics have lost their judgement and want to attack him as a homophobe, despite the fact he was one of the first politicians to back gay marriage. Just as absurdly, they want to smear him as a racist.Oddly, these attacks actually create a problem for Jeremy Hunt.The more ridiculous the criticism Boris faces, the more Tory activists will rally to him. This will make it harder for Hunt to get a hearing for his far more measured criticisms of Boris.All of these hustings will be broadcast on the internet. I understand the Boris campaign were not best pleased about this, which suggests they still have some concerns about their candidate slipping up.But even in this age of political upsets, it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson won’t be the winner of this contest.EDDIE Lister is to run the transition team that will prepare Boris Johnson’s governing programme.Lister, chief of staff for Boris when he was Mayor of London, will take charge of this process and the working assumption is that having done this, he will move to No as chief of staffBoris becomes PM.Crucially, Boris knows and trusts Lister. In his successful stint at City Hall, Lister showed that he knew how to bring order to Boris world – which is no mean feat.One of those close to the decision tells me: “Boris has made the biggest shout, who is your number one man  It is Eddie.” The need for order is urgent.If Boris enters Downing Street, he’ll only have  days until October , the day by which he has promised Britain will be out of the EU. He won’t have any time to lose.Intriguingly, I understand that Sajid Javid – who was knocked out of the leadership race on Thursday – was interested in doing this role.But the Johnson camp wanted whoever ran the transition to become the Downing Street chief of staff. A key challenge for Lister will be to make sure there is a clear structure.Boris has always liked having multiple sources of advice.As one of those who has known him for years observes: “There are going to be lots of dferent courts, lots of people competing for the monarch’s ear – and he quite likes that.”But this source warns that, “as a recipe for government, it could be quite fractious”.It is Lister’s job to make sure there is a clear chain of command.I understand that the spoilt ballot papers weren’t covered in graffiti, but simply left blank.“THE problem is the ,” says one of those preparing Boris for government.The  is a reference to those Tory MPs who voted for Rory Stewart before his elimination from the leadership contest.If only a fraction of this group decides to try to bind Boris Johnson’s hands on Brexit, then the Government could collapse.One of Boris’s closest allies warns that, “It is going to be really problematic, there is going to be a Remainer counterweight to the ERG”, the group of hardline Brexiteer MPs.To the alarm of Boris’ allies, Rory Stewart is uninterested in serving in a Boris Cabinet. Instead, he is setting himself up as an alternative voice on the backbenches.Stewart and his supporters have to remember, though, that a Corbyn government would be worse for this country than any Brexit outcome.The problem for Boris Johnson is that his Brexit strategy relies on MPs giving him time to seehe can use the threat of No Deal to winkle a concession out of the EU.The only chance of these  MPs giving him this time isthey think it is a bluff.“They have to believe it is a bluff, the ERG have to believe it is for real,” con- cedes one Boris ally.Pulling this off is going to be a political high-wire act.BORIS Johnson and Michael Gove have spoken since Gove’s elimination.I’m told the conversation wasn’t substantive but wasn’t rancorous, despite the tactical voting by Johnson supporters that led to Gove being knocked out.In the next few weeks Gove will get on with departmental business. He’ll introduce “Natasha’s law” for clearer labelling of allergens in products, named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret sandwich, and increased sentences for those who abuse animals.I am told that it is “not settled one way or the other” whether Prime Minister Boris would keep Gove at the Environment department or offer him a bigger job. But given the scale of the challenges facing theTories, it would be foolish to not put their most talented departmental minister in one of the great offices of state.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When she was little, Freya Williams, from Plymouth, suffered with severe back pain but wanted to eventually join the British Army, so she pushed through the pain and continued to train for the forces. Freya went on to pick the appropriate A-Levels and was well on her way to achieving her le-long dream. But her hopes were shattered after a visit to the doctor in October last year, which led to her being diagnosed with a number of health conditions.   The -year-old now relies on a wheelchair and cannot be left alone as she suffers between  and  seizures a day, which led to her having to abandon her studies, , reports PlymouthLive .But despite this set-back, Freya remains positive and wants to raise awareness of hidden health conditions and even hopes to write a book to inspire other unwell teenagers.    Freya has al neurological disorder , non-epileptic attack disorder , postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome , hyper-mobility syndrome, chronic fatigue and scoliosis. She said the long list of conditions have caused ious mental health issues as well, but the teen hopes by speaking out she will help other people who are going through a similar situation. The former Heleaposs School pupil said: I have suffered horric back pain for around three years and in October I got diagnosed with scoliosis. This is a curvature of the spine, so my spine is the shape of a aposc’.    This was pretty tough to deal with as my le long dream was to join the army, but I continued to train for the forces and and do my A-levels. Freya also has many allergies and after her GP tried her on a neuropathic pain killer called Duloxetine, she ended up severely ill and was paralysed from the waist down for around  days. She continued: I also had very little movement on my upper body. I was like a young child, I had to be fed, showered, carried. I felt like I’d lost everything. After  days I got discharged from the hospital after finally walking with a lot of aid. But around a week later, Freya was back in hospital, paralysed again, when she got another diagnosis. She was told she had FND and NEAD, which Freya said canapost really be fixed other than having intensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation, which often has no guarantee that you will be able to get back to the way you were prior to getting sick. Freya said when she goes to bed at night, she doesnapost know which part of her body she will be unable to move the following day, which sometimes makes it dficult to carry out daily activities, such as eating.    She said: Living with FND means that when I go to bed I’m the evening I don’t know which part of my body won’t work the next day - so I often can’t swallow foods, I struggle with walking and I went from being army fit to using a wheel chair when I leave the house. Freya also gets memory loss, constant nausea, joint pain and other debilitating symptoms due to the condition.Freya said due to her POTS, which causes her to faint due to her heart rate being really high and her blood pressure being really low, that she recognises dferent places by what the ceiling looks like.The teenager has spent around two months in Derrord Hospital so far this year and for many of those weeks she has been in a state of paralysis. Freya has praised the phenomenal health care professionals that look after her during her stays. She said: I’ve had to leave my job and my education and basically put everything on hold. As a result of all of these conditions I now suffer very badly with chronic fatigue along with a lot of mental illnesses that are very dficult to cope with. The NHS and Livewell staff are just so phenomenal and it is safe to say that without them I would probably still be in a state or paralysis. This and amazing support from my wonderful family and close friends. Since I have gotten sick my le has been turned around. But I now see the world in a new light and I have become a person that I am proud to be.    When you are chronically ill you can wake up some days and not see the point of le anymore, and I think it is so acceptable to feel that way because it sucks, and I feel like that a lot, but I am trying to channel my illness into a positive thing. I met some wonderful NHS staff that inspired me to go into nursing. I have also found an inner voice since getting ill. I am so passionate about raising awareness for chronic illnesses and mental illness and sharing the passivities of my experiences and what I have learnt this year. I try to stay as positive as I can, it’s inevitable to have the bad days and to not be OK all of the time. There is no amount of medicine that is going to make you happy, you’ve got to just try and stay positive and stay upbeat and do everything that you can to make it feel a little bit better and a little bit easier.

And it shows % believe Islamist terrorists reflect a widespread hostility to Britain amongst the Muslim community.The , Tory members are the sole electorate whoaposll decide between Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson to choose the next Prime Minister.   Matthew McGregor, Hope Not Hate’s campaigns director said: “From the grassroots to the great offices of state, Conservative members buy into racist myths, with almost half unwilling to have a Muslim Prime Minister – and only % being proud to have one – and most denying that there’s even an issue to confront.” In an open letter to both candidates, Hope Not Hate have demanded they publicly acknowledge the problem and set up an independent investigation to tackle it. The letter reads: “There appears to be a serious problem with Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Evidence compiled by the Muslim Council of Britain and others shows a systemic issue within the party that affects it at every level – from the Cabinet, to council chambers, to the grassroots.  Urging both candidates to make a public commitment to tackling the issue, the letter reads: “This issue will not disappear on its own – it cannot be wished away. Islamophobia in the party can only be rooted outthe party leadership commits to taking concrete action to do so.” It also calls on the party to agree to and publish a definition of Islamophobia. Closing the letter, Hope Not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles adds: “It is time for the next leader of the Conservative Party, and this country, to show real leadership and tackle the issue of Islamophobia within your party. HOPE not hate is on hand to be a partner in this work” The Tory party has been hit by damaging allegations of Islamophobia and has been criticised by senior Muslim Tory politicians for failing to call it out.

For Terence, married with four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, immigration means pressure on the NHS. “You can’t get an appointment when you need one,” he says. Donna says: “Yes, services are struggling but that’s more about investment.” But when Donna and Terence, from Whitefield, meet over wine and coffee, they find a shared love of Bury Football Club – and agree the NHS needs cash. “It’s been good to have someone to listen to what I’ve got to say, without being shouted down,” says Donna, as they decide to meet up again this week. Terence agrees. “I have strong opinions but we live in a world where people are scared to express them, or to speak to someone with dferent views.” Brecon Beacons  In the foothills of the Brecon Beacons, Annette Lloyd and Emily Durrant are searching for common ground in a canal-side cafe. Emily was not even born when Annette started her first job in a factory, and they are never going to agree on Brexit. But there is much to unite them... Emily, , juggles two young children and three jobs, including her role as a Green Party county councillor. Meanwhile, Annette, , toils on nights as a support worker and helps to look after her grandchildren and elderly relatives. Both agree low wages and austerity mean families are under pressure. Emily, who also works for the National Trust, says: “The economy doesn’t work for families. Wages are just too low.” Emily, from Llangorse, Powys, is a committed Remainer. Annette, , favours Brexit. “It’ll get the factories working again,” she says. But Emily finds common ground with Annette, from Llandeilo Graban, over the NHS. “We’ve been sold down the river,” they agree. Before going their separate ways, Annette and Emily hug and laugh. “When you look at the bigger picture,” Annette says, “we’re very similar.” Stoke  In the leafy hamlet of Stockton Brook, near Stoke- on-Trent, it’s clear William Alcock and Louise Adams both feel passionately about their city. William, , served in the Army for  years before joining the police and Louise, , is a freelance artist who works in the ceramics industry. And William, now retired, doesn’t hesitate to air his views about Brexit. He says: “We are spending £million a day to be in the EU. That is what we are paying the thieves in Brussels. They have taken away our sovereignty. “We are losing control of this country and we are losing control of our cultures.” Louise believes we should stay in the EU. “It will allow us to build on love, peace and friendships,” she says. “Being part of the EU has allowed us to work together, share cultures and ideas.” Louise believes that with the right investment refugees can settle here successfully but William is concerned about the pressure it puts on the NHS. But they agree they both want what’s best for their beloved country.

The presenter and journalist, , was seen travelling with her whippet, Moody, on a busy Great Western train to London Paddington this afternoon. There were few empty seats but she let her dog curl up next to her. Other paying passengers had to look ­where for a place to sit. A witness said: “I was really surprised to see the dog on the seat. There wasn’t even a mat or newspaper underneath it. “For someone who is very much in the public eye, who holds politicians to account, I would have expected her to behave better. “When I boarded the train it was really busy. A lady was looking for a seat and ended up sitting behind Emily and not on a seat with a table, where there is more room.  “Some people chose to stand, as there were few spare seats. It shows a lack of respect for other passengers to feel it appropriate for dogs to sit on seats meant for passengers. “It’s a question of courtesy and consideration for others. The dog should have been on the floor. It could have been dirty or could have had ticks or fleas.” The witness, going from Reading, Berks to London, said Maitlis’s dog slept on the Penzance to London service for at least  minutes before Paddington. Last week, Maitlis, one of ­Britain’s most respected interviewers, was criticised over her handling of the televised Tory leadership debate with hundreds of BBC viewers accusing her of losing control of the candidates and failing to get answers. Bruce Williamson, of the ­Railfuture campaign, said expensive train fares mean “people who have paid for a ticket must come first”.  He added: “I’m surprised a conductor didn’t say something about it. I’m a dog lover, but dogs on trains are essentially luggage and second-class ­citizens to humans. Seats should be reserved for first and ­foremost for humans. “It just highlights the level of overcrowding on our railways and the shortage of seats.” A railway passenger group said Maitlis broke one of the network operators rules. Fraser Pithie, of the Campaign for Rail, said: “The rules do not give animals any right to take up seats. Dogs must remain on the floor. Even guide dogs are not allowed on seats. A train guard should have spoken to her.”  A spokesman from Great Western confirmed the company does allow people to bring animals on their trains but said they are never allowed on seats. National Rail conditions say: “Animals are not allowed on seats in any circumstances” and warn a charge could be madeanimals occupy seats. In a statement, Maitlis said: “There was no one without a seat looking to sit down. “The dog was under the table for the first three hours of the journey whilst four people sat down at it. He came on to the seat for the last  minutes of the journey when the seat next to me became free.” "},{"url":null,"title":"three years after eu referendum","story":"NewsThree years after the EU referendum Britain is more ided than ever on BrexitAs Westminster fails to find solutions, more people favour “no deal” or a second referendumShareByRyan Fletcher:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsStuart Lilland Nick Thompson both from Hull, discuss Brexit \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Three years after the EU referendum, Britain is more ided than ever on Brexit .As Westminster fails to find solutions, more people favour “no deal” or a second referendum. But left-right politics, Scottish independence, trans rights and veganism are also among the topics which we are ided over. Hull voted by .% to .% to leave the EU. Locals Nick Thompson and Stuart Lill dfer over Brexit, but agree politicians are failing to bridge the ide. Marketing worker Nick, , is a Remainer, while Stuart, , a carer for his autistic son, is a Leaver. Stuart says: “It’s very much a case of, ‘You must be a racistyou voted Brexit’. Tell that to my Polish better half and Polish kids. “I’m still a Brexiteer, I just care about my country.” Nick says: “It’s wrong that people on the Leave side are labelled like that. Part of the trouble is representation. You don’t feel represented and I don’t feel represented either.  “It’s just I don’t think that situation will change by leaving the EU.” Stuart and Nick both feel public services are being starved of resources but dfer on the causes. Nick says: “Austerity was a choice by the UK Government and nothing to do with Europe. “Some say it had to be made, but it didn’t. When you think they can’t cut any more, they cut more and more.“As one of the richest countries in the world, we shouldn’t have foodbanksall over the place.We shouldn’t have all these people sleeping on the streets.” Stuart thinks immigration has added to the pressures on public services. He says: “You can’t argue that the numbers that have come haven’t added to the burden on things such as housing and hospital waiting lists. “Populism is rising across Europe because of the hatred of the EU.” Nick worries the power will go from the EU to the UK Government which is “a lot less trustworthy than Brussels”. Stuart agrees: “I don’t think there’s a political party out there that is really doing a very good job.” Nick says: “We both feel politically homeless. Politics now is a shambles.” Devon  * A clash over climate change got a cool reaction from Green Party voter Adrian Allery when UKIP supporter Andre Savini said blaming CO for global warming was hot air. Proving it is possible to disagree very agreeably, -year-old antiques shop manager Andre and deep-sea ship pilot Adrian, , shared their views over a pint in Honiton, Devon. Leave voter Andre argued: “It’s a myth that CO is the main driver in climate change.” Remain voter Adrian thought the two-hour pub chat raised interesting points. “But I simply do not agree with Andre that climate change is a scam to raise taxes, that big pharma is toxic or that the EU is an evil Stalinist empire,” he said. But even these unlikely lads found common ground. They agreed faith schools should be abolished and the first-past-the-post political system is not fit for purpose. Despite his Italian roots, Andre believes immigration has to be controlled, saying he supports UKIP because “mainstream parties are just there for big business”. While Adrian said, “I felt Andre cherry picks facts that back his theories. I was glad we met, I’d do it again.” Bristol  When two Bristol locals went on a debating date in the park, they found plenty of common ground. The sun smiled on -year-old electrician James Pierce and NHS administrator Jane Westmead, , and they found their dferences melting away.Poetry lover Jane said: “It went really, really well. James was very honest, and we were still chatting away hours later when we bumped into Bristol’s Labour mayor Marvin Rees in the park and he joined in the discussions.”Leave voter James said he was expecting Jane to be shouty and unwilling to listen, but instead she was fun and open-minded. He explained: “Although we disagree on many issues, we have the same goals. Jane voted for Remain, but she respects the result and neither of us want a second referendum.” Left-voting Jane admits she had preconceived notions about staunch Tory James. But she said: “We both love the NHS but think it’s very inefficient. London  Retired local government officer Ken Hickford and charity worker Billy Beckett met in a North London Italian restaurant for their debate. Ken, , wants Britain out of Europe but Billy, , thinks unity makes us stronger and more secure. Ken reckons refugees should get sanctuary but be sent home when their nation is back on its feet as the UK’s infrastructure is close to collapse. Billy thinks, by then, they may bring all sorts of value to us and austerity may be more to blame for the problems. They are polar opposites but Ken said: “I liked Billy’s enthusiasm. He seems to believe in politicians and our conversation did give me a boost.” Billy liked talking to someone with dferent views. He said: “Social media confirms our own biases. This has been a way to step out of it.” Liverpool  Remainer Michelle Bennett and committed Brexiteer Dave Jones live just a few miles away from each other. But, on paper, they are poles apart. It isn’t long before Michelle, , a trained social worker, and retired community nurse Dave, , are setting the world to rights over a coffee. Mum-of-one Michelle voted to Leave but has since become a Remainer – worried about the prospect of no deal – and wants a second referendum. “So much has changed since then,” she says. Dave, a mild-mannered father of four from Wavertree, disagrees. He said: “We need to respect the result.” But, both are clear the NHS needs to be valued and we should help refugees. Michelle lives in Toxteth – where Dave was born – and they leave, laughing, and admitting they’d loved the experience. Dave even offered Michelle a lt home. Edinburgh  They met as strangers on a bridge coming from opposite sides. John Birchmore, , is a company director and such an ardent Remainer he moved his company’s centre of operations to Latvia and has a new Irish passport. John’s campaigning for a People’s Vote and even has politics discussions with his postie, who decried the EU as non-democratic while delivering his postal vote. “He failed to see the irony,” says John. Claire Milne, , is a Jacob Rees-Mogg-loving, Tory-voting Brexiteer. At home, she has been told she’s only allowed to speak three sentences of politics a day because, “I tend to go on a bit”. As they settle down to a cool drink in the shade of Edinburgh’s Princes Street Gardens, their conversation heats up until there is table thumping and exclamations of “cobblers!” and “b*****ks!”. John says: “There were lots of myths pedalled by Brexiteers about not being able to sell crooked cucumbers.” Claire retorts: “Bananas!” It’s a robust  minutes. At times, their voices rise higher than a nearby pipes and drums contest. But, at the end, both are keen to chat again. “It’s great to listen to someone who is well informed and can be challenged on details,” John says. Claire laughs: “And no milkshakes were thrown.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i went undercover told take","story":"NewsI went undercover - and was told to take explosives hidden in teddy bears to schoolDavid Rupert was drawn into the dark and dangerous world of terrorism to become a double agent working for the FBI inside the IRA - this is his incredible story in his own wordsShareComments\"ByDavid Rupert :,  JUN NewsDavid Rupert who infiltrated the Real IRA in Ireland while working for the FBI \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was , and I’d been living in West Florida while running my trucking company. I was in Tampa with friends when I heard folk music coming from an Irish and Scottish bar, The Harp  Thistle. I liked the music, so I went in. There one night, I met this beautul, lively woman named Linda. We started dating and I soon learned she was heavily involved with Noraid, the US political wing of the Provisional IRA. I didn’t know much about the Northern Ireland conflict, but feigned interest because I liked Linda. She invited me to Ireland and I accepted. We drove up to Sligo and Donegal on the west coast – Linda knew the owners of pro-IRA bars and they all knew her by her first name.    One of the owners, Joe O’Neill, was a long-time IRA man and he took a liking to me and taught me about Irish history. Linda and I broke up soon afterwards, but I was hooked on Ireland by then and went back by myself to meet Joe and other IRA men.I didn’t know it at the time, but the Irish police were photographing me with IRA members and sent the photos to the FBI.One day an FBI agent showed up at my trucking company office. I said I didn’t know about anything illegal, which was the truth, but he insisted on coming back to ask questions. He then said the FBI would pay for me and my new girlfriend, Maureen, to fly to Ireland when we wanted, in exchange for small pieces of information about the IRA.    As I didn’t know anything, I felt I might as well let the FBI pay for our holidays. So we would go back and forth to Ireland and give the FBI very little. Then one day, Joe invited me to the room he used for IRA meetings, which was above his pub. He said he wanted me to smuggle explosive parts from the US, and gave me the address of a primary school where I should send them – the plastic explosives were to be hidden in teddy bears, detonating cord disguised as skipping rope, and electronic parts hidden in radios. This made me flinch – the idea of sending explosives to a school. I said I would, but I passed on the info to the FBI, and soon the spying operation became more serious. I wanted to move to Ireland anyway, and the FBI agreed to pay for the lease on a pub on the Irish border, near Joe’s bar. My bar quickly became a gathering point for IRA members and the information started to come in.  I liked the customers, but some moments shocked me – like watching a granny bouncing a young boy on her knee and telling him some day he would shoot policemen in the North. Pretty soon the FBI asked me to meet MI, which was keen to have spies in the IRA groups that were opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process. I flew to London for a debrief with an MI agent, and soon I was reporting to them as well. Then, in August , the Real IRA set off a car bomb in Omagh, which killed  civilians, including a mother nine months pregnant with twins. Later, Maureen and I watched a documentary about children injured in the Omagh bomb, one of whom was blinded. It was devastating.  I had to remind myself these were the people I was dealing with. There was a tendency to see them as friends, but I also had to find those other feelings at the back of that – revulsion and disgust for what was happening to innocent people. Then I was introduced to the Real IRA’s leader, Mickey McKevitt, along with several of his top men. He liked me straight away, and I liked him. He was easy to talk to and was enthusiastic about American fund-raising money and my ability to get weapons and bomb parts in the US.Over time, I learned he had a sleeper agentin the US who would be brought to the UK when the time was right to shoot Tony Blair , or some other high-level British establishment figure.I met the sleeper several times in Massachusetts and he was keen toget weapons moving to Ireland.Eventually, Mickey suggested I sit on the Real IRA’s army council. I wouldn’t have voting rights, but I could very to US supporters that their money was being well spent and be able to report back on weapons and bomb parts needed by the Real IRA.The army council meetings were held at a farmer’s cottage in the mountains on the border, where the farmer’s we would make us tea, while he discussed bombings in England and assassinations of police officers.I would send detailed emails to the FBI and MI of what was happening.My scariest moment came when I attended the ‘engineering’ orbomb-making meetings.I brought along encryption software for the team that had been doctored by MI.  One of the top bomb makers was very suspicious and said that it might have been tampered with. My heart was racing and I was sweating. I was petried and couldn’t sleep that night. I was really on edge, wonderingthe Real IRA would find out that the encryption software had been compromised. What would happen to me and Maureenthey did  I knew about the torture and death that came to other IRA informers. There was a case in which a woman was beaten to death by three IRA members, while with another informer, they set up a roadblock, shot him in the back of the head and rolled his car into the canal. The police didn’t find his body for two years. That would have been my fate.  I began to wonder how much longer we could stay in this le. Mickey told me he was looking for a foreign sponsor to supply them with weapons and was interested in Saddam Hussein.I told MI, who were excited and saw it as an opportunity to ensnare the Real IRA.It was agreed with MI that I would testy against some of the Real IRA leadership, and in one day there were arrests of leaders in the south of Ireland, the north, and the US. I was flown to a US airbase in Britain, as I was due to testy against three Real IRA council members who had set up meetings with Saddam Hussein’s agents . Then I flew on the British royal jet to testy against Mickey McKevitt, who was arrested at his home. He wasn’t one bit happy to see me this time, and glared at me. I was nervous at the beginning of the trial – there were lots of TV cameras outside the court, and army snipers on the roof of the courtroom. Mickey’s barrister cross-examined me for two weeks. It was gruelling.  After I finally finished testying, the SAS took me by Hercules plane out of Ireland forever. The most stressful part was after I had finished testying and ed to the US in hiding. I had all this adrenaline running through me for years. Suddenly I wasn’t living on the edge any more and couldn’t handle my emotions. I went on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs, Maureen went on them too. We couldn’t adjust to this new passive world after so many years undercover, but I eventually learned to get on with le and enjoy myself. Mickey McKevitt was jailed for  years and I know he will never forgive me. Still, after the Omagh bomb, I have no regrets about what I did.  I also earned millions of dollars from the FBI, but I can never work again because the Real IRA would catch up with me.

I couldnapost relate. The University of Kent in Canterbury was my number one choice. While attending an applicant day, I was immediately put at ease. The campus was beautul, my desired course— religious studies — was being taught by world class scholars, and it was not too far from my home in Bromley. I instantly knew it was  meant to be.    It is, however, an understatement to say that in September   I was nervous. I dreamt and imagined what this new phase of my le would entail but had no idea what to expect.The numerous Netflix films I watched, exhibiting the American college experience would never prepare me for the journey I was about to embark on.“We hate you you f******  n*****” was the racial abuse directed at me by my housemate in my halls of residence.  My housemates took personal offence to the fact that I did not want to drink and go out with them. I was friendly but reserved because I was still acclimatising to le away from home. Additionally, getting drunk every night and being asked to clean up vomit was not my idea of fun.  It was only the first couple of months of university, I wanted to take my time. I had worked so hard to get into university. It goes without saying that I quickly became the least favourite person in the house. Living in the most aesthetically pleasing accommodation, Turing College,  on campus — jokingly referred to by some as Beverly Hills — could not compensate for living with people I did not get on with. My bedroom not only became the place where I had to store my kitchenware, it became my sanctuary. However, even my room couldnapost shield me from the unedying sight of  strangers using my shared toilet with the door wide open! It is a notorious attitude that because the first year does not contribute to your final degree, you do not have to work as hard. Whilst many of  my first year counterparts were partying nightly, I was determined to excel academically from the outset.      Consequently, I was a first year student stressing out like a final year one. Year  Carrying the weight of isolation that the  first year brought, I feared that my bedroom, my place of refuge, had become a cage, locking me away from all of the enjoyable experiences that the University of Kent had to offer. I did not regret working hard in my first year because that is what I set out to do.  I did, however, feel that consuming myself solely with my degree was unhealthy and not conducive to forming meaningful relationships and enjoying my university experience outside of academia.    As a British-Jamaican person, I noticed that a wider isolation  existed among students of caribbean heritage at university. In response to this,  I co-founded a society, with Louise Mayne, where  such students could be represented and elevated. This society, Kent Caribbean Union , aims to rewrite the narrative by educating, raising aspirations and inspiring all students to fulfill their potential. It was, therefore, to my dismay that KCU had to fight for the right to exist. Even the backdrop of the th anniversary year of Windrush and the infamous Windrush scandal would not motivate some members of the student body  to acknowledge our right to be represented. Second year was the year where I really had to strengthen my time management skills. In addition to my responsibilities to the society, I  devoted time to being an academic mentor and outreach ambassador. By this stage I no longer lived on campus, but privately rented of off campus   with my sister and two other friends  — whom I had met during the previous year. The courses we studied were religious studies, maths and law. The novelty of not living under your parent’s roof soon wears off as you become burdened with the responsibilities that come with independent living. Luckily, I moved to Canterbury from Bromley and so was never too far away toto home comforts. Year  With Canterbury Cathedral within a stoneaposs throw of my house, I was ashamed that by my final year I still I had not managed to visit it. I began to explore the beauty of the city. Walking down the quaint cobbled streets served as a constant reminder of the rich heritage of this city. The contrast between the lively and progressive student city with the historic sights and buildings never ceases to fascinate me. This amazement, however, quickly dwindled when I noticed the visible homelessness, something I did not see as often in Bromley. Canterbury is home to three dferent universities, accommodating thousands of UK and international students. It is evident that much of the  ersity present in the city can largely be attributed to the substantial student population.    I always wonder what Canterbury would look like without such student residents  This year was the most rewarding as the society soared to new heights. At the Kent Student Awards , KCU, was awarded ‘Group of the Year’ and ‘Outstanding International Multicultural Initiative of the Year.’ We were also shortlisted for Outstanding Contribution to Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity, being the only group to be shortlisted in more than one category. The awards ceremony celebrated other inspiring students who are contributing to changes in government policy, campaigning against social injustices and raising awareness of illnesses. Considering this, not only is there evidently hope for my generation, but I am proud to have unapologetically fought for something I believe in. Whilst my three years in Canterbury have been physically, mentally and emotionally draining, they have built my character,confidence and inner strength. So would I do it again  No. Am I happy that I did it  % yes. I have left Canterbury, not just with a st class degree, but with a better sense of self. University of Kent statement A spokesman for the university said: We do not tolerate any form of racism or racist abuse. We are committed to the promotion of ersity and inclusivity within the University community, and this commitment is underpinned in our Institutional Strategic Plan. Through the Student Charter that we developed with Kent Union, the University has also committed to the fair and equal treatment of every person, and to ersity and inclusivity in its student and staff community.    Our students are also committed to treating fellow students, University staff, visitors, neighbours and all people equally and respectfully, regardless of gender, religion, community background, nationality, race ethnic origin, disability, marital or other status, responsibilities, sexual orientation or age.   In order to ensure all students are fully informed when it comes to treating everyone with dignity and respect we created the aposExpect Respect @ Kent’ e-learning module which all students must complete within six months of arriving at Kent.

Sophie Matheson, , dropped from a size  to a size  in just  weeks after getting in touch with a personal trainer. She got married in October and has since lost another stone, taking her total weight loss to six stone. Sophie, who works at Intake Farm Primary School in Mansfield, said: I had reached a point where I was dreading my wedding day. I was anxious about the photos, how I would look and feel in my dress and what others would think of me, and knew I had to do something to make a positive change.    She got in touch with local personal trainer Luke Hewitt after seeing some of his work on social media. Sophie, who lives in Ollerton, in Nottinghamshire, said she was nervous before her first session but was put at ease by Lukeaposs team. I started to see changes really quickly and began to develop a love for the gym, she told Nottinghamshire Live . She trained with Luke three times a week for  weeks in the lead up to her wedding day, with a programme that included a combination of cardiovascular exercise and weight training as well as a diet plan. Sophie said: My job as a primary school teacher can be quite stressful and fast paced and my diet before starting the programme reflected that. A typical day would have previously started with good intentions, with Weetabix for breakfast and fruit for my mid-morning snack, but then it would start to go downhill. Lunchtime would arrive and the staff room at work would be full of cakes and biscuits, so I’d help myself to those before grabbing a pre-packed wrap or sandwich for lunch. After work, I’d go to the shop and get crisps, sweets and chocolates and binge eat and then dinner would be something like wedges and a burger. We would also indulge in takeaways several times a week.”  Before she lost the weight, Sophie took  tablets a day for endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome , but now she doesnapost take any medication at all. Sophie is a vegetarian and now keeps to a diet plan tailored for her.

She has continued training and lost a further stone. She said: I felt amazing on my wedding day, and I definitely have Luke to thank for that, but for me this wasn’t just about losing weight for my wedding.

The -year-old woman began kicking off  minutes into the journey from Stansted Airport last night, according to witnesses. Chance Lewis-Donnelly and Stewart Brown, who were sat about eight rows behind the woman, said she became abusive swearing and then trying to hit the staff. She complained about their seats when they first got on the plane... but she seemed fine then and fairly polite as a couple swapped seats with her, Miss Lewis-Donnelly, of Deal, Kent, said. We were delayed on the runway so we were sitting there for a while. I noticed her go to the toilet and at that point she was fine. Were you aboard the plane  Contact webnews@trinitymirror  About  to  minutes later she started kicking off, hitting the seat in front of her and shouting. She then stopped and we took off. As we took off she started shouting and singing again. The cabin crew asked her to stop, but she continued. And eventually staff had to request assistance from the RAF, which sent two fighter jets to escort the Titan Airways A back to Stansted, in Essex. People reported hearing an explosion as the jets were scrambled - later confirmed by police as a sonic boom - up to  miles away.    The passenger was restrained until she was escorted off the flight by officers from Essex Police. She remains in custody after being arrested on suspicion of two assaults and endangering an aircraft. Dramatic photos and video seen bycapture the arrest. But Miss Lewis-Donnelly continued: She became abusive, swearing and then trying to hit the staff. She walked down the aisle and was attempting to open the cockpit door. She was restrained by cabin crew and passengers.  The crew decided we needed to ert and contacted air traffic control who thought we needed assistance so scrambled the military jets, and all the while she was being restrained by passengers. She was escorted off the plane by police when we landed but the police had her on the runway for a while causing further disruptions. We were around eight rows back, but most of the commotion happened at the front of the plane so I couldn’t hear what was being said, only her shouting. Jet sent a plane from Manchester to collect the other passengers and take them to Turkey - and they arrived some six hours later than scheduled.  Mr Brown, a -year-old mobile DJ, said: She seemed absolutely fine before take off. The stewards gave her several chances and did the best they could before she became abusive and then made a dash for the cockpit and had to be restrained by staff and passengers. A spokesman for the airline said: “We are aware of an incident regarding an extremely disruptive passenger on a flight from Stansted to Dalaman yesterday. The aircraft has ed safely and we are liaising with the relevant authorities to support their investigation. We are working hard to ensure the remaining customers reach their destination as soon possible.  The assisting jets were scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Essex Police reassured residents the huge bang was not an explosion, as initially feared. We were made aware of a disruptive passenger on an inbound flight to Stansted on Saturday, June , a spokesman for the force said. There is a possibility that residents nearby may have heard a loud noise, often associated with a sonic boom, as the aircraft descended into Stansted airspace. Officers attended and arrested a -year-old woman on suspicion of two assaults and endangering an aircraft.

But the future is in safe handsnine-year-old Ella McEwan and her sister Caitlin, seven, are anything to go by. After learning at school how rubbish is endangering sea le, the eco-aware pair from Southampton set up an online petition for fast-food giants to stop putting plastic toys in children’s meal boxes. Inspired to act after a family trip to Burger King, their campaign has already attracted , signatures – and counting.  The girls said: “We like to go to eat at Burger King and McDonald’s but ­children only play with the plastic toys they give us for a few minutes before they get thrown away and harm animals and pollute the sea.” Staggeringly, McDonald’s is the largest toy distributor in the world, handing out more than . billion a year in a tsunami of single-use plastic. On tomorrow night’s War on Plastic on BBC One – hosted by Anita Rani – the problem is laid bare showing millions of toys – many unopened from fast-food meals and magazines, as well as Kinder Surprise eggs, all adding to our mountain of plastic waste. A new advert has also popped up on our TV screens to promote Cadbury Freddo Treasures. But this “treat” is more plastic waste than chocolate – a purple plastic treasure chest and plastic toy versus a handful of chocolate buttons.    Yes, in theory these toys can be recycled – as McDonald’s states on its website – but it is rarely economically viable to do so thanks to the mixture of plastics they are made from, meaning most still end up in landfill or being incinerated. And the thing is, the kids don’t actually want them either. “We want anything they give to us to be sustainable so we can protect the planet for us and future ­generations,” Ella and Caitlin added. The solution to this problem lies with the producers taking ­more responsibility for this mess. Help the girls out by signing their petition here .

Imagination is necessary in spades however, because for this particular property, viewing is not essential, or even advised. In fact, potential buyers are warned ‘DO NOT enter the cottage UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES’. And since Lavender Cottage went up for sale in , firstly for £,, and then inviting offers in the region of £,, no-one has been allowed inside... until now.  Inside the abandoned Aleister Crowley house of West Cornwall  After following the old path on my hands and knees through the undergrowth for about  feet, I reach Lavender Cottage, completely hidden in a Cornish jungle of brambles and stinging nettles. Despite all the branches pushing into the building from every side like nature’s scaffolding, the structure looks decidedly unsafe, as warned. Nevertheless, I don my hard hat and delicately climb through the window.     The cottage is small and simple, with the ground floor split in half by a staircase iding what was once a lounge and a kitchen, leading upstairs to where there was once two bedrooms. The cottage features on historic maps dating back to .  The empty bottles of Corona also date back to the eighties, when people could redeem p when they ed the bottles to be recycled.In , UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove proposed that similar schemes were reintroduced to encourage people to recycle bottles by financial incentives.The  pence redeemable for the two Corona bottles is included in the price of the property.    Since this half drunken can of Coke was left on a rusting fridge, at least three decades have passed. The Berlin Wall has fallen, as have almost all of the interior walls in Lavender Cottage.  However, the cottage has not been untouched during that time. There are signs inside where repairs have started in earnest. Cob has been used to try and sure up some of the walls, as has concrete in places, such as around the old Rayburn.    In , a planning application for ‘alterations and erection of extension sites’ were ‘approved with conditions’. With the house derelict at this time, there are no obvious signs that these plans came to fruition.      Transforming the cottage from a two bedroomed house with no toilet into a three bedroomed home with bathroom and downstairs W.C., the plans appear to have been approved by Carrick District Council, but again, never became a reality.   The first Google Street View car to drive past Lavender Cottage, did so in June .A ‘WARNING KEEP OUT’ sign can be seen on the side of the house, which is still there today somewhere underneath the foliage. However, there appears to be repair work on the roof and front of the building, and a caravan on the land has its door open, asoccupied.    Lavender Cottage went on the market for £, with Camel Homes in , described as offering the ‘opportunity to live the dream in Cornwall and create your own perfect home’.    Despite the cottage being off limits to any prospective buyers, the estate agents say that they have had a lot of interest in the derelict property which sits on a plot of approximately . of an acre. However, no-one has snapped it up yet, and not being able to see inside it might not be the only factor putting people off.    The letter from Cornwall Council to the interested buyer concluded: “In summary the proposal that you have put forward for residential development through replacement for which Policy  of the Cornwall Local Plan is unlikely to be supported as the residential use on the site appears to have been abandoned. If you are minded to proceed with the development proposal on this site it is strongly recommended that you first obtain a Lawful Development Certicate to demonstrate that the existing home is in fact lawful.” What this essentially boils down to, is that planning permission to demolish Lavender Cottage and build a new home in its place is considered likely to be refused. So anyone who buys this property will have to work with what is already there, renovating the existing property as it stands.    Asthis old cottage wasn’t entangled enough with greenery, it is also now constrained by red tape. However, it doesn’t take too much of a stretch of the imagination to pull back the brambles and ivy and see this home as it once was, with its sunny garden and plentul orchard.    And standing inside Lavender Cottage, red tape to one side, it is easy to see how these crumbling walls could become a home once again.If you would like to find out more about Lavender Cottage, you can get details from  Camel Homes . Do not enter the property under any circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"jihadi jacks parents haunting story","story":"NewsJihadi Jacks parents haunting story of how sweet little boy turned into ISIS fanaticJohn Letts and Sally Lane have been convicted of funding terrorism after sending money to their son Jack Letts after he joined the Islamic State in SyriaShareCommentsByPippa Allen-Kinross:,  JUN NewsJohn Letts and Sally Lane have been convicted of funding terrorism \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The parents of Jihadi Jack have spoken about how their le is now in ruins after being convicted of funding terrorism because of sending money to their son when he joined the Islamic State in Syria .Organic farmer John Letts, , and former Oxfam fundraising officer Sally Lane, , were handed  month suspended sentences on Friday. The court at the Old Bailey heard how they ignored repeated warnings their son had joined the Islamic State terrorist group and sent money to him despite being told three times not to by police.  They were convicted over a payment of £ wired to a man in Lebanon in September  at Jackaposs request, but found not guilty of trying to wire a further payment of £, on December  that year so Jack could pay for a people-smuggler to help him escape. The jury could not agree on a third attempted payment of £. Jack converted to Islam as a teenager, and it has been suggested he was radicalised by someone he met at a mosque in Oxford when he left school after failing his AS levels. His parents gave him money to travel to the Middle East in May  to study Arabic, first in Jordan and then Kuwait. But, in September , he rang Sally and told her: Mum, Iaposm in Syria. However, by  he had become disillusioned with the group and attempted to leave. He was captured by Kurdish forces and is still in jail in northern Syria, now aged .Sally told the Mail on Sunday she was immensely pleased not to be in prison but her le was in ruins, while John said the conviction destroys me. Sally said: My career and my le are in ruins. The people I used to work with donapostmy calls. Above all, Jack is still a prisoner. I feel guilty when itaposs a nice, sunny day, because Jack is shut up in a room with no access to the open air. My fear now is they are trying to make him so ill he either dies or kills himself. She said she thinks about her son every second of every day. John said: Being found to have supported terrorism is a tremendous blow. Itaposs going to have a huge impact. Inside, it destroys me. But he added he will never give up on his son. The trial heard that the pair refused to believe their -year-old son had become an extremist when they allowed him to travel, and following the verdicts they said they remain committed to help Jackhome. Judge Nicholas Hilliard said he was suspending their sentences only because of very special circumstances and he accepted that the pair loved Jack very much, but warned they had lost sight of realities and ignored warnings. The Mail reported that Jackaposs mental health was deteriorating by the age of , and was diagnosed with Touretteaposs syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder.   He converted to Islam soon afterwards but John said prayer became one of his OCD ritiuals.  Jackaposs best friend Mazen told the Mail on Sunday said he had seen Jackaposs mental health deteriorate after the age of . He said that before he left the country, he would sit in a corner, whispering to himself in Arabic. While he was in Syria and Iraq, his parents said he often tried to reassure them that he was safe and not in a warzone and not a fighter. In January , he married Asmaa, the daughter of an Iraqi tribal leader, who his parents have spoken to just once by phone. The couple had a son, but it is not knownAsmaa or the child are still alive.Five months after his marriage, Jack was hit by shrapnel from an air strike and taken to Raqqa for medical treatment. From this point he appeared to become more militant, including posting on Facebook about carrying out a aposmartyrdom operationapos against the British Army.In September , they agreed to send £ to Jack, accepting his assurance it was aposnoting to do with jihadapos and was to help someone in poverty who needed new glasses. From December  Jack began to ask his parents to send money to help him escape. Although they were initially told they had permission to fund Jackaposs escape, this was later rescinded and they were told they would be prosecuted. Jack Letts has admitted he was at one time prepared to carry out a suicide attack, telling the BBC: I used to want to, at one point, believe it or not. Not a vest. I wanted to do it in a car. I saidthereaposs a chance, I will do it. In the interview, which took place in October last year but was not broadcast until his parentsapos trial had ended, he said he realised he had been an enemy of Britain but added he had made a big mistake.

Jessica Hyer was studying at the University in Manchester and originally planned for it to be a short-term fix, but it ended up having damaging long-term consequences for the vulnerable student. Becoming a ‘sugar baby’ on an established website was easy, but the ‘pay per dates’ arrangement soon became sex work for Jess.She became reliant on the large amounts of money she’d receive in exchange for dates and sex with older men, she told the Manchester Evening News.   It was quick cash for the desperate -year-old, who had supported herself since leaving home aged . For her, the reality of sugar daddy dating was far from glamorous. In fact, it was dangerous and isolating for Jess, who has been left traumatised by some of the encounters she had with so-called ‘sugar daddies’. Jess, who lives in south Manchester, now wants to lt the lid on apossugar daddy datingapos in a bid make young women and men aware of what it entails, and some of the risks. The -year-old is also setting up a support network for so-called apossugar babiesapos, offering them safety advice, someone to talk to and advice on how to get back into regular work. “The way sugar daddy dating has been glamorised is problematic,” says Jess. “There are vulnerable girls and there are underrage girls who lie about their age on those websites. “Don’t get me wrong, there are some girls who love it and have successful relationships with men on there. All the power to those. “But the ones who need support, and have had awful experiences like myself, that’s what is important to me. “People shouldn’t think it’s all rosy and glamorous because it’s not.” Jess grew up on Stoops Estate in Burnley, one of the most impoverished postcodes in the UK, and left home when she was . She went to college before gaining a place at the University of Manchester to study English and Drama.  A year into her studies, Jess was in what she describes as ‘financial ruin’. She was £ overdrawn and owed her friend £. The earnings from her part-time job as a waitress weren’t going to pay the debts she owed.Then, an advert popped up on her Facebook feed featuring a ‘sugar daddy dating’ website.“They target students and you actually get a free premium accountyou have a student email,” says Jess.  “When you look at the page there’s an image of a young attractive man. “They make you think that these men are mentors and, that they are going to help you with your career, men who don’t view you in a sexual way. “When really, sex is usually the end goal, she said. Jess said it soon became apparent that ‘sugar daddy dating’ wasn’t a scenario where an older, wealthy man lavishes a younger girl with gts or long-term financial support. Instead, men were using it as a way to pay students for sex. At first she would meet men for dates only, making between £ to £ per meet. But as her financial circumstances became more desperate, she agreed to have sex with the men she met online for much larger sums of cash. On the first arrangement of this kind, Jess was picked up from her student house in Fallowfield by a man driving a Lamborghini. “My first proper, proper sugar daddy messaged saying ‘a dinner and a date and a night at mine for a grand’,” says Jess. “I’d never been on a date like that but I was desperate so I had to take the risk. “I got in his Lambo and he passed me a grand in cash, a wad of £ notes with a ring around it. I’d never seen that amount of money before. “That was one of the few glamorous occasions of sugar daddy dating for me. “I was so scared I askedI could get out the car and post the money through the door in case he killed me. “I felt I had so little choice at the time I just did it.” Jess estimates she met with around  men through a website over four years. The men she’d meet were usually in their forties and fties with a iety of jobs and backgrounds. Some were wealthy businessmen or doctors, but some she knew very little about. “They don’t all have loads of money,” adds Jess. “In fact, some are really tight.” What sugar daddies seek from sugar babies ies, Jess says. Some want to take the girls on dates and have the ‘girlfriend experience’, while some ask for arrangements where there are no sexual limitations and want to indulge fetishes. Jess said she often hid the seedy reality of sugar daddy dating from her friends. “Some of my friends thought it was really fun and glamorous but that was only because I didnapost tell anyone what it was really like, most women don’t,” she added. “Most of us wouldn’t admit what it’s really like unless it’s to another sugar baby.  “I sugarcoated it at the time because I didn’t want anyone to know what I was really doing. “I did feel a lot of shame because of the way men and women view sex work. But you can’t deny that it’s happening and it’s not going to stop.” Jess said the longer she did sugar daddy dating, the more risks she took. It all started to have a severe effect on her mental health. She said she was left traumatised by some of her experiences with men who paid her, and has had therapy to recover. “Once you get into it you get used to the money and it’s hard to get out,” says Jess. “You start lowering your standards and you start taking risks because you need the money. “And when you get the money you spend because you think ‘this is an easy le’. “I was making up to £ a date sometimes, but not all the time. “It was enough to support myself but also my problems. “My mental health severely deteriorated around this time and it was heavily influenced by what I was doing. “I felt so isolated and there was no support for people like me at the time. “There’s nothing for the girls to chat on the site I used. “I’d reported a number of users to the site and never got a response. “None of it is taken seriously. “I’m not saying that all the men on there are not nice. “But in my experience the vast majority of men don’t treat you like you’re human. A sugar daddy once said to me, aposI usually go for girls who are less pretty like you because they are less confidentapos. “To them you’re an investment and a sexual investment.” Jess managed to extract herself from sugar daddy dating last year. With therapy and the support of her partner, Jess has taken control of her mental health and is recovering from some of her experiences.    Her aim is to get a job as a mental health support worker and start her masters in applied theatre in the autumn. Her sugar babies support group will be open to students turning to sex work through websites to fund their time at university. “I managed to get out of sugar daddy dating and I want to be part of that process for other people. “I want people to know that I’m not judging those with a positive experience. “I personally had a terrible experience and at the time I felt there wasn’t any support available to me “I want to provide that support for men and women without judgment.” The Manchester Evening News has contacted the website Jess used for a response.

His parents ensured he had staff tending to his every need, and the gardens of his home were filled with cages containing monkeys and bears for his entertainment. Huge playrooms boasted more toys than any European store and the gardens inside the walled compounds where he was raised were so large that many called them parks. A personal chef was hired to be the future North Korean dictatoraposs friend - and the young Kim would don military gear to boss adults around. Thataposs according to a new book about the feared world leader, who executed his uncle and had his half-brother killed with a nerve agent.  Washington Post journalist Anna Field has chronicled his le as a child and as a teenager sent to study in Switzerland in new book The Great Successor. The son of former Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il - who died in  - and grandson of the countryaposs founder, Kim Il-sung, he was a spoiled brat in childhood. Contact with other children was scarce, Field writes, with his eighth birthday party attended by high-ranking adults instead of other children. In an interview with Vox, Field said: He was brought up to believe that he was a demigod from the age of three or four, probably as long as he can remember.  Even when North Koreans were plunged into famine, Kim was probably unaware of the horric conditions they were enduring, she believes. Determined to give the young boy the same mythical status afforded to his father and grandfather, propagandists claimed Kim was such a good marksman that he could hit a lightbulb from  metres. When he was eight, it was claimed he could drive a truck at mph. The author said he was close to his mother, Ko Yong Hui, from who he got the belief that he was a military genius, as well as a love of basketball.  Her influence was seen everywhere from the cartoons of her that suddenly started appearing on TV to the way her sons were promoted and moved up the ranks, Field stated. In the s Kim was sent to live and study at the International School of Bern in Switzerland under a  identity. This was done in the hope that exposure to the West would turn him into a reformer - but the author said the opposite was true. She told Vox: What his time in Switzerland must have taught him is thatit wasn’t for the family myth and family dynasty, he’d be a nobody. Knowing that without his connections he would be another ordinary, chubby immigrant kid going to school and struggling with his math homework, he decided to perpetuate the system.  Although he would kick and spit on his fellow students in fits of anger and frustration, Field said there is no evidence of Kim being a pyschopath - and he did make four close friends. He would regularly play basketball after school, watched by his uncle and aunt who acted as his s. They would set up picnic-like chairs and cheer him on - something classmates found odd.When he did take over from his father in , many thought the dynasty would collapse within months. But Field writes that his every move is calculated to ensure he stays in power.  Under Kim, the country carried out its first successful hydrogen bomb test in , and has developed a new generation of cyber hackers. Field believes that Kim is very consciously trying to look like his grandfather, who is still revered in North Korea. And Kimaposs ruthlessness has not seen members of his immediate family spared. Half-brother Kim Jong-nam died after being attacked with a nerve agent at Kuala Lumpar International Airport in Malasia in . While his death is regarded officially as an assassination, it is thought of by many as a public execution.  Although it has never been proved, Kim is believed to have ordered the killing, believing his half-brother was a threat. Four North Korean suspects left the airport shortly after the assassination and left Korea without being arrested. And his uncle Jang Song Thaek - described in North Korean media as despicable human scum, worse than a dog - was reportedly fed to  hungry dogs in .

Staff at Tobe Zoo in Ehime, south Japan carried out the emergency drill on Saturday. Instead of using a real lion an employee donned a furry suit and large mascot head. The clip begins with the ferocious beast wandering somewhat aimlessly down a concrete road. After looking around dubiously for some prey, it opts to walk away from four men holding up a net with poles.    An official looking man in a blue unorm does eventually catch the big cataposs eye, prompting the King of the Jungle to race towards him. The man is thrown backwards but fortunately his colleagues hold firm, rebuffing the flesh hungry mammal.    A small white van then appears and crawls alongside of the lion. Out of its windows a zoo worker aims a gun towards at the brown and yellow animal, firing a singular shot.    As a pair of real lions look on, the mascot-like feline staggers to the floor. A long poll is threaded through the window which pokes the animal, making sure it is firmly out of action before workers rush over to restrain them.    Mascot costume culture is particularly prominent in Japan. Yuru-chara for example, is just one category of many mascot categories. With unsophisticated and cute looks, yuru-chara characters represent towns and their history, culture or produce.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have. We are also inviting them to meet with us in person in Brussels and with our permanent staff in our Brussels office, the British Agriculture Bureau.Andrew McCornickMinette BattersJohn Daviesand Ivor Ferguson "},{"url":null,"title":"show us your mojo","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDon#t miss out on your chance to play on MOJO#s unique live stage on October  in Ardfern.Bands have only three weeks left to enter their demo on to MOJO organisers, so don#t delay to be part of this exclusive night of original live music.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"high street fashions boost charity funds","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHigh Street style and a good cause drew fashion-conscious ladies from miles around to Lochgilphead Joint Campus.The Mid Argyll group of the Marie Curie charity hosted a special fundraising fashion show on Monday June  in association with Colours.An audience of around  eager shoppers were treated to fashion items from shoes to cardigans and handbags to floaty summer skirts, all well known brands at discount prices.The evening, which included a raffle featuring excellent prizes, raised around £, for Marie Curie, which offers support to people and families affected by terminal illness.Jenny Brolly of the Mid Argyll Marie Curie fundraising group said: #Once again thanks to the community for turning out to support Marie Curie.#An enjoyable evening was had by everyone.#"},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The school, which is at the heart of more than  new homes at Letham Mains, is being funded entirely through developersrsquo contributions.Morrison Construction, which is also behind the development of the nearby East Lothian Community Hospital, was appointed to build the primary school, which will have  classrooms suitable for pre-school and primary teaching, a dining hall, social space and a two-court PE hall with retractable seating for performance and community use.Now the foundations and concrete base have been completed and the steel frame is being put in place.As part of the projectrsquos commitment to sustainability,  tonnes of ground soil taken from the site have been moved to other projects in the county, including a BMX track in Musselburgh.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, a Haddington ward member and cabinet spokeswoman for education, visited the site to meet with Morrison Constructionrsquos team there.She said: ldquoItrsquos great to see the progress that is being made on the new school.ldquoHaddington is growing, with people choosing to live here because itrsquos a lovely town with beautul natural settings and good transport links within the county and wider region.ldquoItrsquos important that we keep up with the pace of growth, have facilities in place to accommodate it, and ensure our wider community benefits from it.ldquoI look forward to ing to Letham Mains Primary School later in the construction process as it continues to take shape.Outside the new building, areas will be designed for outdoor learning, PE and play.Jim Hanna, Morrison Construction project director, said: ldquoIt was great to be joined by council representatives on site so they could see the progress we are making.ldquoWith groundworks and foundations complete, we are now under way with the steel frame for the new building which will start to provide the community with a sense of what the school will look like once delivered.ldquoMorrison Construction is committed to minimising the impact of our activities on the environment and local community.ldquoAlready during the project we have been able to ert hundreds of tonnes of soil from landfill for reuse at Musselburgh, and we look forward to maintaining a proactive approach to sustainability throughout our time at Letham Mains."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-musselburgh-gala-2019","story":"Organised by Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, the fun-packed event is adored by youngsters in the Honest Toun.From noon until pm, there is a range of activities on offer including shows, quad bikes, face painting and dance displays.Edinburgh magician Alexander the Great will enthral gala visitors with his magic and circus skills show and Dinky Donuts will be present to keep those hunger pangs at bay.East Coast FM lead the fun and games as compegraveres.Also present will be Musselburghrsquos Army Cadets, Air Cadets and Sea Cadets, with musical entertainment provided by the Penicuik and Musselburgh Boysrsquo Brigade Pipe Band.Representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership will also be on hand to discuss its work with the local community.The Brunton Bistro serves tea, coffee, sandwiches and pies in a marquee.For those who prefer a snack as they enjoy the many activities, Sizzlers are selling food such as burgers, bacon rolls and chips.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

He and the SPFL have committed to discuss the matter at the next board meeting.The Justice Committee, which is made up of SNP, Tory, Labour, Lib Dem and Green MSPs, has intervened by making its own approach to the SPFL.In her letter to Doncaster, Mitchell wrote to ldquoadd to the calls for the SPFL to publish the report:ldquoThis was referred to earlier this week in the Scottish Parliament and the Committee believes that transparency on this matter is essential.ldquoYou will be aware that the Justice Committee has undertaken a signicant amount of work in recent years on the problem of sectarianism at football, including consideration of legislation in this area. The Committee members therefore request that data held by the SPFL and SFA on this matter, and any recent report, is published.Football clubs have been accused of taking little action to stamp out sectarianism directed towards players, fans and managers.Former Kilmarnock manager Steve Clarke responded to chants of ldquosad Fenian b****** at Ibrox in February by saying it was reminiscent of the \"Dark Ages.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes also hit out after Celtic fans called him a ldquosad Orange b****** during a Scottish Cup semi-final.Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur said: ldquoThis dodgy agreement to keep essential statistics secret, available only to the SPFL, police and government ministers, should never have been signed in the first place.ldquoMinisters knew before the SPFL started collecting the data that they never intended to make it public, but didnrsquot force a change of approach.ldquoPersistent sectarian behaviour at football is hurting the sport and Scotlandrsquos reputation. It will be impossible to know whether progress towards cleaning it up is being made unless this data is released.Doncaster said: \"I had a very positive meeting with Humza Yousaf where he formerly requested that a iety of information be made public.\"We will now discuss this as a board before deciding the best way forward.\"During the conversation, we wholeheartedly agreed on the imperative to do all we can to tackle unacceptable conduct and underlined our keenness to play an active role in the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on combating sectarianism in Scottish society when it convenes, we believe, in the summer.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mavis-81-completes-lands-end-to-john-ogroats-cycle","story":"Mavis Paterson, who lives near Stranraer in Dumfries and Galloway, set out on May  from Landrsquos End and reached John OrsquoGroats on Saturday.Mrs Paterson, who took up the challenge in memory of her three children, who died within four years of one another, raised more than pound, for Macmillan Cancer Support ndash smashing her pound, target.Itrsquos hard to find the words now.

Napoleon slept, it is said, with a version of the ldquoCeltic Homer under his pillow as he fought his campaigns in Egypt, and the German literary giant Goethe was famously inspired by the tales of the blind, third-century bard Ossian, and the adventures of Fingal and Oscar, Malvina and King Swaran.Indeed, Macphersonrsquos writings ndash fragments, he contended, of ancient Gaelic stories, tales and songs that he had collected, translated and heard ndash inspired composers, poets, politicians and artists across Europe. In Britain alone, the works of the man from Ruthven, Badenoch, influenced Burns and Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott and Byron.However, the Ossian tales as told by Macpherson in a series of publications starting with Fragments Of Ancient Poetry in  ndash largely gloomy stories of wars and loss, tumultuous epic landscapes roiling with storms and conflict ndash were publicly savaged by critics, most notably Samuel Johnson, one of the most famous men of letters of his day.Johnson said the Ossian tales as presented by Macpherson were ldquoas gross an imposition ever the world was troubled with. The charge was that Macpherson was a fraud, and had essentially written the works himself.The controversy was huge at the time: Macpherson defended his work,not as robustly as an author may do in these more media-savvy times ndash one account notes that he challenged Johnson to a duel ndash and the Highland Society of Scotland launched an official investigation, which found, albeit not until , that he had used genuine material in his work.Some  years later, Macphersonrsquos works are little known, and have not benefited from a renaissance in their audience through radio, television or film: Ossian is not a namethat creates many ripples in popular culture.However, a major new show at Scotlandrsquos National Museum ndash Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland, which opens this week ndash hopes to shine a new light on the Ossian controversy. It shows the Ossian tales as crucial to the development of Romantic thought and literature in the late th century, and states clearly, and provides evidence, that Macpherson based his work on authentic texts.Scholars, too, see the whole controversy at the crux of a tension between industrialised central Scotland and the rapidly changing Highlands, and between Scottish culture and the burgeoning idea of British Empire and the dominance of obviously ldquoEnglish culture.Johnsonrsquos ridiculing of Macpherson was much more than a literary argument: the cultural and political undercurrents of the controversy are unmistakable.The exhibition includes one of Macphersonrsquos sources, the Red Book of Clanranald. It adds: ldquoJames Macpherson maintained that his translations of the Ossian cycle were based on authentic Gaelic verse, ballads and songs, collected during his travels in the Scottish Highlands ... Macpherson consulted and collected original Gaelic manuscripts belonging to numerous Highland families.ldquoThese included the Red Book of Clanranald, a volume containing the history and lore of Clan Donald, which was compiled by a member of the MacMhuirich family of bards.The curator of the show, Dr Patrick Watt, said that Macpherson was ldquoscholarly and rigorous in his research.He said: ldquoMacpherson definitely made use of old manuscript sources, we have that one in our show. Itrsquos very interesting to see how he approached his task ndash he had evidence. These are real things, whether he actually changed them or not, we are almost past that now.ldquoI think when you look at it for what it is ndash a lasting interpretation of the remnants of Gaelic poetry ndash then it is fantastic. If you read them, they are incredibly interesting, the characters that are portrayed are fascinating ... the thing that really hit me was that you have a man who goes for himself to investigate these documents. Why did he do this  I doubt it was because he thought it was going to be a best seller.One of the contributors to the show, Dr Domhnall Uilleam Stiugravebhart of Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, believes it is high time for Scotland to move beyond the debate over the ldquoauthenticity of Macphersonrsquos Ossian tales.He said: ldquoYou could talk about it for hours, it is an under-researched part of our own history, which at long last, we can stop being embarrassed about. Put to one side questions of authenticity, and think about how it was put together. It was not just a work of literature, it was seen as a historical document when it was first being produced. It was first produced with footnotes.ldquoMacpherson ushered in an age of romantic nationalism which is still with us. We have never really left that age, and by looking at Macpherson we can fruitfully compare him with other national myths, national epics that were being created, or shall we say recreated, in the th and th centuries, including JRR Tolkienrsquos own attempts to provide the English with national myth in the form of Lord of the Rings.Of the controversy, he added: ldquoIs Macpherson a fraud and a faker ndash or is he perhaps trying to do something possibly a bit more interesting with his own native culture  There is absolutely no doubt, first of all, that he made stuff up.ldquoAt the same time, and we should say that very quickly indeed, he was drawing upon an existing culture of Gaelic, heroic ballads common to both Scotland and Ireland, they date from the middle ages, and they are about Fionn mac Cumhaill and his heroic band, and the defender of Ulster, Cuacutechulainn.Professor Nigel Leask, Regius Chair of English language and literature at the University of Glasgow, says that scholarship suggests Macpherson drew upon about  traditional Fenian ballads ndash that is, medieval and post-medieval heroic ballads in Gaelic relating the feats of Fionn mac Cumhaill and his warrior band the Fianna ndash working from notes of transcriptions made from oral performances and some old Gaelic manuscripts.He added: ldquoBut there was a lot of lsquopaddingrsquo, and his most ambitious long poems Fingal and Temora presented the ballads in the form of epics, modelled on the th centuryrsquos understanding of Homerrsquos Iliad and modern sentimental poetry.Professor Tom Devine, the distinguished historian, has another view of the Macpherson controversy. He notes the tension between the myth that Macpherson was writing, and the reality of Scotland ndash and indeed Britain ndash in the late th century.The stormy epic, godless but noble and ancient, contrasted with a country rapidly gearing up to the Industrial Revolution and, in the Highlands, the Clearances.Devine said: ldquoThe impact of Ossian in Europe was quite extraordinary. Itrsquos dficult now, in the cold light of the st-century day, to think of how the celebrati in Europe were seduced by him. The other aspect is you are dealing with two parallel universes at this time ndash at the same time as this almost fictionalised Highland Scotland was being projected, the break-up of the real traditional society was accelerating rapidly.ldquoOssian was having an impact from the s. And that is the decade when you are beginning to see the rapid commercialisation of Highland society. The s are a real break point in the journey towards modernity in Scotland ... we see the first signs of emigration on a major scale, and the first removals from land at a signicant level. So at the same time as a romanticisation is going on, a quite dferent narrative is occurring at the same time.Devine added that the way Macpherson wrote in the tales suggested ndash sometimes explicitly ndash that Highlanders of the late th century were ldquothe antique past, living in the present, in a way which did not exist anywhere  in Britain, a seductive idea because of the ldquosheer pace of advancing modernity in the UK.The works, too, Leask notes, ldquogave new dignity to Gaelic culture and language that had been crushed in the aftermath of Culloden [in ] and, in a way still seen in modern marketing images for Scottish tourism, ldquocast a romantic light on the rugged mountain landscape, and even turned terrible weather ndash mist and rain ndash into a sublime Ossianic experience, encouraging huge number of tourists to visit the region in the romantic period.Watt notes that the debate over Macpherson and what was authentic and what was his own invention may carry on for many years yet.Stiugravebhart added: ldquoYou can spend your entire time knocking your head against a wall, playing lsquospot the genuine versersquo in Ossian. I am not saying we should move on from that, but I think a more fruitful line of enquiry would be to try to examine and analyse what Macpherson was up to, and beyond that, why at this particular juncture this should be such an attractive literary production, not just for people in Scotland but across the world.ldquoI think the first thing to say about Macpherson is that he didnrsquot work alone. He was the poster boy of a coterie of Scottish enlightenment figures who were interested in Scotlandrsquos past and what that past might tell us about the development of society. So, OK, he was creating literature, but he was also bringing to light these incredibly valuable documents, which illustrated what le might have been like in Scotland, , years before.Macpherson, who died in , perhaps did not help himself.Leask says his original inspiration was existing traditional Scottish and Irish ballads about Fionn mac Cumhaill with which he had been familiar since boyhood in the ceilidh houses of Badenoch, as well as further material he collected in the Highlands and Islands in -.He added: ldquo[The verses] were only lsquoauthenticrsquo in the sense that he had freely adapted traditional Gaelic Fenian poetry ndash it would have been betterhe had admitted as much. He was a dficult and curmudgeonly personality, but made a lot of money from his successful literary career.The Ossian texts are available in current publishing such as Blind Ossianrsquos Fingal, published by Luath Press of Edinburgh.Watt says thata filmmaker adapted the works for the screen, the current general lack of knowledge of Macphersonrsquos works would quickly be overturned. In the meantime, the texts are still available to read ndash Leask says itrsquos best to ldquotry reading it loud, taking long breaths, to capture the flavour of the original.Stiugravebhart added, of reading the often ldquogloomy and morbid works: ldquoYoursquove got to let yourself go, plunge in, and live in the moment. Someit is unreadable, some it isnrsquot. Some of it echoes or gives a foretaste of what other romantic writers, with better reputations, would write over the next two generations.ldquoItrsquos always worth having a go with Ossian, and see what you think.Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland, National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, runs from June  until November ."},{"url":null,"title":"headline-to-come","story":"WHEN she talks about her fatherrsquos long and tortured last days her voice begins to crack. It is only when she gets on to who she blames for killing him and failing her and her family that it regains a steely edge.Justine Gordon-Smith holds the Scottish and UK Governments responsible. For their failure, not just to properly compensate for infecting their dad with the blood products which would finally kill him, but virtually abandoning him and his complex needs and leaving her and her sister to provide round-the-clock care as he became more and more ill.Justine is one of four girls, two of her sisters live away, so it was left to her and her sister Rto look after their father Peter in Edinburgh as he deteriorated from a caring and funny man to a bedridden one they could barely recognise. All four were at his bedside when he died and she can be precise about it ndash it was .pm on July , just  days, she notes, after the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, which infected him, opened its ldquoshiny new pound million building in the Heriot Watt Centre.Peter Gordon-Smith was a well-known figure on the Scottish music and entertainment scene, a musician and primarily double bass player ndash he backed Shirley Bassey and others ndash and he managed night clubs, worked at the Citizensrsquo Theatre in Glasgow under the legendary Iain Cuthbertson, even managed a youth hostel in the Edinburgh.ldquoHe was a very outgoing man. He loved a yarn and a funny story. He could charm anyone, she recalls. ldquoHe was a very talented musician and he was also very handsome.Peter was a haemophiliac. ldquoWhen we were young I remember him having the odd bleed and he would go to hospital for a few days. But it was manageable. ldquoYou were always very conscious of it and how an injury would affect him.It was in  that Peter was told he was infected with the Hepatitis C virus, although he was not told how he got it or when. It is clear, however, from his medical records that he received clotting agents Factor VIII and cryoprecipitate produced by the transfusion services Protein Fractionation Centre and administered by the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, the RIE.ldquoHe was absolutely outraged when he was told. There was a distinct lack of information about how he became infected. Dad looked into suing the hospital, but that didnrsquot go ahead.Justine, like all the core participants in the new inquiry, has had to sign a non-disclosure agreement ndash in case information at this stage might prejudice future legal chargesanyone is held responsible ndash but she is determined not to be completely silenced.For  years, from when he was told about the infection which would finally kill him, the family received no help or compensation. In  the UK Government set up and funded three charities ndash while refusing to admit liability ndash one of which was the Skipton Fund.ldquoAround that time R found out about it in a newspaper article and we applied to Skipton. Peter subsequently received pound, as well as pound a quarter. The money was used to do up his house, just a stones throw from the Scottish Parliament.Justine, a filmmaker, who was brought up in Edinburgh with sister R, had been living in London but in  ed to pursue a doctorate at Edinburgh University in film and geography. She and R were shortly to become their dadrsquos full-time carers.ldquoHe had been badly beaten in the  and spent a long time in the RIE in . He developed what they call an inhibitor - the clotting agents were facing increasing resistance - and he would turn over in bed and bleed, or opening the door, even shaking hands.In  he developed sores in his legs which refused to heal. In that same year he had a fall in the bath, which led to him developing even more resistance to clotting. At the beginning of  Justine asked the hospital to perform a liver test on Peter. It revealed cancer.ldquoWe used to call him the Comeback Kid, he was so stoic, but this time he said lsquoIrsquove finally hit the buffersrsquo, she recalled.Skipton awarded Peter a further pound,.In May  he was told the cancer was terminal and there would be no further treatment. He was put on steroids and other drugs. ldquoUp until he took the steroids he was a lovely dad. As soon as he took them he went.Justine and her R were now alternating carers. She says she was repeatedly told she was ineligible for carers allowance because she was a student and was unable to work. Later, the sisters were given  hours a week assistance.Peter tried to kill himself in July, taking a massive overdose. After an alert, because the part-time carer couldnrsquot get in, Justine rushed to the house. Her father was saved.ldquoHe was put on fentanyl [a powerful opioid]. This strange creature then appeared who was not our dad, Justine recalls.There was a second suicide attempt in September ndash ldquoGod knows how many Tramadol he took ndash and again he was brought out of it.ldquoThat was the only time I saw him as my dad again. He was so angry he wasnrsquot dead. He didnrsquot want to be alive.Justine and R installed a drug safe in the house so he couldnt try that method again, but he was later to attempt it a third time by stabbing himself. She adds, on the verge of tears again, ldquoWe had become his jailers and his prisoners.After the sisters had taken turns on seven-nights-a-week suicide watch without any support they were given a carer for three nights.ldquoEventually we got seven nights a week, but only when Dad was so frail he required double staffing, but we got at least to sleep in our own beds, Justine says.In  the Scottish Government set up the Scottish Infected Blood Support Scheme which replaced the Skipton and other charities. While it makes payments to those infected, and to partners and dependent children, non-dependent children, carers like Justine and R, donrsquot qualy.ldquoHow can you say itrsquos generous  Why doesnrsquot the government just hold up its hand like the Republic of Ireland The Irish Government has paid out over euro billion in compensation, with the average award euro,.ldquoMy sister lost twenty-one thousand pounds from not working and Irsquom about seventy thousand out of pocket, she says.But itrsquos not about money, itrsquos about justice. ldquoI am outraged at the way our father, our family and other victims and their families have been treated.

He was interested in seeing where his father had come from.Having arrived in Edinburgh, his eyes were opened by the breadth of knowledge of botany that thrived in the city.Johnson adds: ldquoHe wrote lsquoI am very much mortied by my ignorance of botanyrsquo. He was surrounded by people who were completely conversant in botanical science and he didnrsquot know a thing.Hosack resolved to improve his knowledge, and spent hours in botany classes and exploring Edinburghrsquos gardens, including the original botanic garden in Edinburghrsquos Leith Walk, which later evolved into todayrsquos Royal Edinburgh Botanic Garden.Back in New York, he ventured beyond the city limits to Manhattanrsquos untamed pastoral landscape where in  he paid under , for a -acre stretch of land. There he built greenhouses inspired by the ones hersquod seen in Edinburgh and paid tribute to his fatherrsquos birthplace by naming it Elgin Botanic Garden.ldquoHe planted all kinds of agricultural crops, adds Johnson. ldquoItrsquos amazing to think he was growing barley, wheat, cotton and sunflowers on land where the Rockefeller Centre stands today.ldquoHe experimented with native and non-native species. He taught students how to identy plants and prepare medicines, and they conducted chemical experiments to figure out whether plants that were not known could have medical properties.ldquoHe built two ft conservatories which were clearly modelled on the ones hersquod seen in Leith Walk and had plants brought from all over the world.The conservatories faced what is now Fth Avenue, while streets which today are a hub for commerce and retail were surrounded by a belt of forest trees and shrubs.

More than % of respondents supported the plans.The plans have been at the centre of controversy after some womens groups, backed by several prominent SNP MSPs and MPs, say the new legislation could put womens spaces at risk.They claim that predatory men could access womens refuges, toilets and other facilities.Now transgender and non-binary Scots have spoken out about their disappointment following Sommervilles announcement on Thursday.Emily Frood, a trans woman from Edinburgh, said: \"Irsquom ashamed, disappointed, and incredibly upset by the actions the Scottish Government have taken this week in relation the GRA reform.\"Trans and non-binary people in Scotland have been let down.\"The Scottish Government has suggested reforming the GRA in a frankly half-arsed capacity.

This has never been the case.\"Irsquove campaigned on this reform for nearly four years and to see it get ripped to shreds as a result of what comes across as a public pressure from a minority of bigoted people is heartbreaking.Kerry Rush, who is non-binary and from Edinburgh, added: \"To say Irsquom disappointed is an understatement. Irsquom heartbroken, for myself and for the entire trans and non-binary communities. We waited  months to hear from the Scottish government about our rights, or lack thereof. We were led to believe they were working to help usbe legally recognised and instead we received two pitul sentences [In Sommervilles statement].\"Non-binary people are people and deserve to live and love as part of wider society with the same rights and privileges as others. Instead what this so called progressive Scottish government has done is send a message of absolute disrespect and disregard for all non-binary people.\"I exist and I wonrsquot be erased. I will keep fighting for my existence to be recognised.\"One senior SNP source said that the decision to roll back on the manesto pledge is down to \"weak leadership, and the First Minister not having enough control at the top.\"Colin Macfarlane, director at Stonewall Scotland said: \"Now that the government has made this announcement, and it has fallen well short of what we had hoped, they are going to have to show leadership to ensure they tackle transphobic language when they hear it and when they see it, and ensure it is called out. \"Trans people have had their lives put under the microscope now for the past  months, so it is the governmentrsquos duty of care now to ensure that that rhetoric is dialled down while we go through yet another consultation.\"Cabinet Secretary for Equalities Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoWe know that some in the trans community will be feeling a sense of deep disappointment at what they see as a lack of progress on trans rights. I want to reassure them that the Scottish Government is committed to reforming the  Act and to removing unnecessary barriers for trans people to live in their true gender. We are committed to doing so during the current parliamentary session.ldquoHowever, it is important for that reform to be passed with strong support from across the Chamber and wider society.

It was nominated for three Oscars, with Lasseter himself being presented with a Special Achievement Academy Award.ldquoSuddenly, writes Cavalier, ldquothe rush was on for computer-animated features.The rush became a torrent, with ious Hollywood animation studios getting in on an increasingly lucrative trend in film-making and opening a new chapter in the history of animation, a history in which key moments had ranged from early Disney classics to works by influential figures as erse as Tex Avery, Ray Harryhausen and Stirling-born Norman McLaren.Today, the list of top-earning animation movies on the Box Office Mojo website is headed by such films as Incredibles  , Finding Dory, Shrek , The Lion King, Toy Story , Frozen, Finding Nemo, The Secret Le Of Pets, Despicable Me , and Inside Out. Merchandising tie-ins and DVD sales have also been hugely profitable.In , the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences launched a new Oscar category, for Animated Feature Film. The first winner was DreamWorks Animationrsquos Shrek, followed in successive yea rs by Spirited Away, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Wallace  Gromit in The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, Happy Feet, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Toy Story , Rango, Brave, Frozen, Big Hero , Inside Out, Zootopia, Coco, and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. Of these  winners, no fewer than half were products of Disney Pixar.Animated films have become increasingly sophisticated in terms of their storylines. Again, Disney Pixar has blazed an adventurous trail, giving the world films about a lonely little robot cleaning up a ruined Earthan elderly widower who tethers balloons to his house in order to embark on one last adventurethe control centre of the mind of an -year-old girland a young Mexican boy stranded in the Land of the Dead .There was also that remarkably daring scene in Toy Story  when for a few minutes the toys resigned themselves to be an appalling fate, in a trash-incinerating facility. This, observed Empire film magazine, was ldquoa scene of such intense, exquisite end-of-the-line poignancy mdash also the scariest moment of the whole [Toy Story] series mdash that it deserves comparison with Snow Whitersquos terried forest flight, or the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Indeed, much has been made of the emotional palette of the best animated films, and of the \"le lessons\" that can be learned from them. \"Negative feelings are perfectly okay\" is one such, gleaned from Inside Out. Bereavement and grief were powerful impulses in Up.The software used in the making of the films has steadily grown more sophisticated, too.Asnoted this week, the first Toy Story film, in addition to being a critical and box-office success, also helped Pixar to win an ldquoanimation arms race, with visual effects going on to become a staple of blockbuster films. The crucial weapon in all of this, the paper added, is RenderMan, a software tool that enables film-makers to create photorealistic computer images.Toy Story  was made on an updated version of RenderMan, using ray tracing, which, says the , allows animators to achieve granular detail on light shading.Rob Redman, editor of D World  D Artist, is quoted as saying: ldquoThe outdoor scenes in Toy Story  are really where it comes into its own. You get the blues and greens where the sky is bouncing off the floor: it makes everything feel lush and vibrant. \"Realistic\" is not quite the word, but it does feel more real. The textures feel more believable.The Spectatorrsquos film critic, Jasper Rees, concurs. ldquoThe animation now has such a painterly exactness it may as well be real rain stubble tarmac up there on screen, he writes.And while Hollywood may dominate the world of animated movies itrsquos important to remember the influential work of, for example, Studio Ghibli, which is based in Tokyo.It has made a succession of strikingly beautul films, from Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro to Howlrsquos Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke.The Red Turtle, a superb animated fantasy ndash a French Japanese production \"presented by Ghibli\" ndash was described in the following terms by the prominent critic, Mark Kermode: ldquoA poignant, wordless tale of a man shipwrecked on a desert island, it boasts a sublime simplicity that unies its complex elements into a singular, universal voice.\"Eloquent, profound and moving, it left me with a heart full of bittersweet joy, a head dizzy with dreamy visions and cheeks wet from tears that rolled like waves on a distant beach.INCOMINGTHE big US studios have an impressive slate of animated films in the pipeline over the next few years. Some of them are sequels, taking the themes of the original hit film and exploring them further.Disneys Frozen , the long-awaited follow-up to s Frozen, the biggest-grossing animated musical of all time, will be in cinemas this winter.Pixar has two films due out next year: Onward , about two teenage elf brothers \"who embark on an extraordinary quest to discoverthere is still a little magic left out there\" and the newly-announced Soul, which will debut next June .

The tennis ace, who was close to retiring in January as he was struggling to walk without pain, let alone play tennis, strolled off with the silverware at his first attempt back.Murray and Lopez - the latter fresh from winning the singles title less than an hour earlier - beat Britains Joe Salisbury and Rajeev Ram of the USA -- - after a third-set match tie-break.Murray had insisted after their first-round victory that winning was not his number one priority this week but the three-time grand slam champion has clearly not lost the appetite for a battle.The fledgling partnership was - down in a first-set tie-break but fought back to level, and took it when Ram pushed a forehand wide.The second set went the way of Salisbury and Ram after Murray dropped serve, and like so many matches during Murrays career, it went to the wire.Lopez, who must have been running on empty, somehow conjured up a series of stunning winners in the match tie-break to secure his own personal double and an unexpected, but welcome victory for Murray.He said:\"Its incredible. Its tough to believe. I won this tournament in . That was the best win of my career. And then I did it again two years after, and then I won the doubles half an hour after that!.\"Murrays win lit up social media, with his mother, Judy, posting an image of the victors, saying: \"Mothers pride.\"Martina Navratilova Tweeted: \"How great to have @andy_murray back playing and congrats to him and also to @feliciano_lopez for winning both singles and double at #QueensTennis\""},{"url":null,"title":"beef event one of the best yet","story":"Early morning rain failed to deter farmers from attending the Scottish Beef Association#s Scotland#s Beef Event  held last month on a leading Aberdeenshire beef farm.Around , people streamed into North Bethelnie Farm, near Oldmeldrum, on Thursday, May .Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, speaking at the opening ceremony“It was a very successful day and generally recognised as one of the best of the biennial beef events the SBA has organised over the years,” said SBA vice-chairman, David Barron, who chaired the organising committee.“The  trade stands reported good business and the extensive technical demonstration area was thronged throughout the day with farmers keen to pick up all the latest technology for the beef industry.”Mr Barron was full of praise for the host farmers, Robbie and Barbara Milne, and their son, James, who put on a great show.One of the highlights of the day was the tour of the  acre all-grass farm – with no fewer than  tractors and trailers at the ready to avoid queuing – which took visitors right to the top of the hill, where they were treated to an ice-cream from neighbouring farmers, Mackie’s, while enjoying magnicent views of the Aberdeenshire countryside looking up to Bennachie.Beef farmers – like all farmers and indeed the whole of industry – are facing an uncertain future as the debacle and stalemate of the Brexit negotiations continues.The only thing farmers can do is to make sure they are operating as efficiently and productively as possible so they are in a strong position to cope with whatever hits them in the future – in or out of Europe – and they had plenty of pointers at the Beef Event which more than lived up to its theme - Breeding, Feeding, Succeeding.Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, who in giving the official opening address, reiterated his support for the beef industry and determination to reverse the continuing decline in the national beef herd.But saying is not doing although, in fairness to Mr Ewing, he dropped more than a broad hint that the Scottish Government is looking at an emergency support package for the beef sector. This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sc launches new children s activities programme","story":"Garioch Sports Centrethis week announced that it islaunching GSCkids, a new programme of children#s activities, in a bid to make children#s activities more accessible in the local area.Launching on Wednesday, August , children will still be able to enjoy their favourites, including additional football classes, and some new additions including Junior Boxercise.GSC will also be offering preschool gymnastics classes in partnership with Donside Gymnastics for the very first time.Sandra Simpson of Donside Gymnastics commented: “We’re delighted to be launching five brand new preschool gymnastics classes at Garioch Sports Centre. “Classes are suitable from .- years old and are the \u2028perfect pathway into our school-age gymnastics programme.”Garioch Sports Centre’s Kevin Bonarius, chief operating officer, added: ‘The aim of GSCkids is to provide a safe and inclusive environment for local children and their families and carers to enjoy active lestyles while having fun.“Our doors are open to children of all ages and abilities.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon. He will also sign copies of From Scuttle to Salvage at The Orcadian Bookshop on June , from am to pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HM Coastguard said the ordnance was found on the seabed during an underwater survey yesterday.The discovery was made just a day after a series of commemorative events took place at Scapa Flow to mark the centenary of the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet, which left  men killed.On Friday, ers from the Royal Navy and the German Navy went underwater to lay wreaths at the site, where more than  German warships were deliberately sunk by their commander at the end of the Second World War so as to prevent them being ided up amongst Allied forces.In the wake of the weekend discovery, a military explosives ordnance disposal team was dispatched from Glasgow. The group is expected to carry out an assessment to make the device safe.An exclusion zone has been set up in the area, with warning signs erected urging people to stay at least  metres away from the waters between Hoy and Cava.Kaimes Beasley, duty controller for HM Coastguard said: \"With weather in the area likely to be good, its more than possible that e charter boats will want to go there, but our strong advice is to keep away.\"Scapa Flow is one of Scotland’s most popular e sites, thanks to the number of British and German wartime relics lying on the seabed.It is not the first time that a torpedo has been discovered in the area. Three years ago, Royal Navy bomb disposal experts were sent to detonate an ordinance thought to have been fired at HMS Royal Oak by a German U-boat in . A total of  men were killed in the naval disaster.During the initial detonation, a section of the bomb containing its own explosive charge broke free and appeared on the surface of the water.However, the Royal Navy team carried out a second controlled explosion to destroy it.The German High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow following Armistice in November  while negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles were ongoing.Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter was in command of the  vessels - viewed as a threat to the UKs dominance at sea - but had not been informed of a last-minute extension to finalise details of the deal.He did not want the assets shared among foreign powers without the German governments consent and was struggling with a mutinous, embarrassed and increasingly bored crew.With the previous deadline for a treaty passed, he issued an order to scuttle the ships.The admiral was made a prisoner of war but his act of defiance was celebrated in Germany.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm we are poorly served by a political class devoid of self doubt","story":"Alex Salmond waged war on nuance five years ago, and the equally certain Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are keeping up the good fight, writes Euan McColm. Admirers of the high art of comedy may be familiar with an especially brilliant sketch written and performed by David Mitchell and Robert Webb. The pair – dressed in Germany army unorms – are on a World War Two battlefield, preparing an attack. Webb’s character, puffed up and confident, puts down a field telephone, and declares, “They’re coming. Now we’ll see how these Russians deal with a crack SS ision.”As distant gunfire echoes, Mitchell’s character approaches, nervously clears his throat, and begins, “Hans…”“Have courage, my friend,” says Webb’s alpha.“Yeah, eh, Hans, I’ve just noticed something,” comes the reply.“These communists are all cowards.”“Have you looked out our caps, recently ” asks Mitchell’s beta.“Our caps ”“The badges on our caps, have you looked at them ”“What  No… a bit.”With an anguished look on his face, Mitchell’s character continues, “They’ve got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our caps have actually got little pictures of skulls on them ”“I don’t, um…”“Hans,” Mitchell’s soldier continues, tentatively, “…are we the baddies ”There is more to come and I urge you,you haven’t seen it, to seek out the sketch, online. It is masterful stuff that endures almost  years after it was first broadcast on the double act’s BBC Two sketch show.Perhaps what makes this sketch so timeless, beyond the excellence of the performances, is that it captures something with which we can all identy. Which of us hasn’t, at some crucial point in our lives, been stricken by a moment of crushing self-doubt  Which of us hasn’t wondered whether, maybe, we are in the wrong I watched the sketch again last week and it occurred to me that it could not be more relevant, right now.Self-examination has never been so unfashionable uncertainty is a weakness to be deplored . Among the political classes, absolute certainty must be maintained, even in the face of crushing evidence that destroys one’s assertions.Think of the bluster of former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, who led the war against nuance during ’s independence referendum campaign. Any dficult question about how he might oversee the break-up of the UK was dismissed by Salmond as part of a “Project Fear” campaign designed to terry voters who might not have believed independence to be in Scotland’s best interests. Salmond’s aggressive reaction to legitimate inquiry created a culture in the Yes campaign where the done thing was not to consider the question but to question the motives of the questioner. After all, since we could be certain that independence would be a very good thing with no downsides, anyone who suggested otherwise must have had malice in their hearts. Of course Scotland would retain its EU membership after voting Yes, insisted Salmond, in the face of remarks from the EU that contradicted him. Of course an independent Scotland would enter into a currency union with what was left of the UK, despite assurances from the then chancellor and his Westminster shadows that no such arrangement would or could take place. Of course Scotland, standing proudly alone, would be wealthy and prosperous, even though the price of North Sea oil – on which this assertion was based – was plummeting.This absolute certainty infected the Yes campaign which, often, mistook angry shouting for debate and went on to discover that it needed more than blind faith to persuade a majority of Scots to support the independence project.A year later, as Donald Trump ramped up his campaign to become American President, dangerous certainty reached a new, even more disturbing level. Evidence of Trump’s misdeeds – things like film and audio recordings and paperwork that, by any standard, proved he was unsuitable for the role he sought – was rejected by the candidate as “fake news” and his supporters, so utterly convinced that Trump would make good on his promise to “make America great again”, accepted his words as truth. To question Trump’s claims was to be a traitor.And in , the same characterisation of doubt as weakness proved invaluable to Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as they bluffed their way to victory in the referendum on EU membership. Their every proclamation about “freedom” and “sovereignty” was accepted, without question, by their disciples. Self-reflection can be a painful business it’s hardly surprising that we are so uncomfortable about doing it. It’s so much easier to blame a former partner for the break down of a relationship than it is to consider whether our own behaviour might have played its part. It’s comforting to think that we missed out on a promotion because the interviewer had it in for us rather than because, maybe, another candidate was better suited. Over recent weeks, we’ve listened as contenders to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and, by extension, Prime Minister of the UK, have set out their “plans” to achieve Brexit where Theresa May failed.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyCouncil defends warning householder they could face hefty fine over unauthorised Irish language street sign Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"this is how many points you ll get on your licence for these driving offences","story":"Drivers who accumulate  or more penalty points from motoring offences within a three-year period can face a ban from driving for up to six months, while six or more penalty points within two years of passing your driving test can lead to a license withdrawal and a re-test requirement.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"22 northern ireland schools could close because

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

Deputy Leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds, Boris Johnson and DUP Party leader Arlene Foster \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"   Deputy Leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds, Boris Johnson and DUP Party leader Arlene Foster Mr Johnson addressed the DUP annual party conference in Belfast last November.However, Mr Robinson told the BBC’s Sunday Politics show that his party has good relationships with most of the candidates.Youd be amazed at how many people in the House of Commons want to build a relationship with usDUP MP Gavin Robinson“You’d be amazed at how many people in the House of Commons want to build a relationship with us , and we do have good relationships with almost all of the candidates that were seeking to be on the paper to succeed as Conservative leader, and the same is true of Jeremy Hunt,” he said.Mr Johnson earlier this year voted for Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit Withdrawal Deal – which the DUP opposed – despite earlier saying he would not back it.“It clearly contradicted what he had said previously where he had given clear indications that he doesn’t like the backstop and indeed he has reiterated those since, I think there was a quest within the Conservative ranks to get this done in the belief that evenyou were to vote for the Withdrawal Agreement, you could change it afterwards,” Mr Robinson said.“We saw the flaw in that approach at the time so we didn’t back the Withdrawal Agreement because we believed once the structures of the agreement were affirmed, it would be very dficult to change those structures. Boris Johnson now accepts that’s the right case.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Conservative party leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt “I think he recognises our concerns, he sees that a border down the Irish Sea – as does Jeremy Hunt – both recognise that sort of a border, that impediment to trade between one part of the United Kingdom and another, or indeed the insistence from the European Union they should have any say in interrupting the internal affairs of this country is wrong.“So the position they have adopted through this campaign, and previously, is positive from a unionist perspective.”Turning to a future deal under which the UK will leave the EU, Mr Robinson said his party will continue to use its influence to press for the protection of the union.“They are a long way from delivering a deal andwe are involved in discussions with them and advocating our position to them, we’ll be making sure that no outcome is going to be detrimental to this union we cherish,” he said.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the wait to find out who will be the next prime minister will not stop the ongoing political talks in Northern Ireland to restore powersharing government.“We approach the talks positively, we want to see a resolution and a re establishment of the institutions at Stormont, we think Northern Ireland as a society benefits from having a democratically elected, locally accountable decision making process,” he said.“We want to see that now and when a deal is right, a deal will be done.“The engagement you could say starts and stops, but there is a level of productivity now where I think the engagement is sincere. “That doesn’t mean that all the issues are resolved, and you’ll have heard other commentary which suggests they are not, but the willingness I think is there and the prize to have a restoration of the Executive is there to be achieved provided you get an outcome which is fair, which is proportionate, which is balanced.”"},{"url":null,"title":"future pm seeking to delay brexit would face eu hostility varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As recently as last week members of Westminsters Foreign Affairs Committee visited the area and heard similar concerns.Read MoreBrexits impact on many cross-border initiatives finally revealed in reportAs we boarded the plane to head back to London news broke of what would come to be known as the backstop agreement between the EU and UK namely that in the absence of another solution to keep the border open with no checks and no infrastructure, Northern Ireland would effectively remain within the EU customs union and large parts of the EUs single market.In the joint report published by the UK Government and the EU the following day - December ,  - we had the first mention of the mapping exercise which showed how North-South co-operation, established under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, relied to a signicant extent on a common EU legal and policy framework.The document noted that the UKs departure from the EU \"gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South co-operation\".Hoping the mapping exercise would provide answers to the people we met in Co Armagh, our committee went to considerable efforts to secure its publication.We called for this to happen in reports in March, May and September .We wrote letters to consecutive Brexit Secretaries of State in April, August, October, November and December . We asked for the document, face-to-face, in April and July . Despite the publication of a technical explanatory note in December , we did not get the full story until this week, after it was obtained by a member of the public through a Freedom of Information request.The document, which we have now published, lists  areas of le in Northern Ireland that could be impacted by Brexit.It demonstrates very clearly that the residents of Armagh were right to be concerned, as many areas of co-operation are \"not underpinned or linked\" to an EU law but listed because of their link to the Good Friday Agreement.Its deeply disappointing that the Department for Exiting the EU did not choose to share this information with us or with the people of Northern Ireland. Its another example of the Government not giving Parliament the facts which we need to help inform our decision-making.The stakes are even higher now as the clock ticks and the Conservative leadership debate takes up some of the available time until October , just  weeks away.Alternative arrangements for the border are highly unlikely to be in place by then or indeed any time soon, which makes the transition and the backstop as important as ever. And as for leaving with no deal, our committee concluded in January that a managed no-deal cannot constitute the policy of any responsible Government.Hilary Benn MP is chair of the Committee on Exiting the European Union"},{"url":null,"title":"late goal only a consolation for cavan as impressive donegal secure fifth ulster title of decade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They had much more success once they had their best forwards on the field. They probably scored enough to give them hope that they can still make the Super s.Declan Bonners side were also retaining the title for the first time since . But as this group of players look forward to the Super s in which they will be in the same group as Kerry, they will be aiming to go one better than in  and reach the All-Ireland semi-final.Cavan opted for a defensive side drafting in Ciaran Brady and Gerald Smith – who replaced corner-forwards Cian Mackey and Conor Madden. Obviously the strategy of team boss Mickey Graham was to stay in the hunt for as long as possible and then unleash more of their forward power.In the event both sides set up defensively – Cavan pulled  men behind the ball when not in possession while Donegal did one better and pulled everybody back.Read how the game unfolded:  []jsdjs.src\"embed.scribblelive widgets embed.js\"ijs"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts wattlebridge road in newtownbutler closed during security alert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  .However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m.Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":null,"title":"we can sort out border after brexit says boris as rivals for pm lock horns","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"cable in talks with tory and labour mps on defecting","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

So, my coach and GB coaches suggested I give it a go this year. My shoot was what won the event.ldquoI was neck and neck with the previous British champion most of the way round.

Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past. You can see the dference even in the way the likes of Tom Murray, only  and Darragh Mallon at , are playing like demons, he beamed.ldquoThe other thing be brings is a great calmness on match days.The lads respond well to that, when he has a quiet word with them beforehand.This will be Downrsquos fourth appearance in the Christy Ring final, but they have only lted the cup once and that was back in ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New working group to run local mountain bike trails  ","story":"A NEW working group is to be established to assist with the management of the hugely popular mountain bike trails in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is keen to meet with those who use the trails and organise local events, alongside representatives from Cycling Ireland, to discuss what have been described as a number of challenges in managing the facility and sister trails in Rostrevorrsquos Kilbroney Forest Park.Over pound.m has been invested in developing trails in both parks and together they attract over one million users each year, with pound, invested annually in their management.The success of both authorised and unauthorised trails within both parks presents challenges for Newry, Mourne and Down Council, members of its Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee were told on Monday.The local authority manages the bike trails under licence from the Forest Service and is also responsible for their maintenance.Politicians were told that in addition to the authorised trail network, an unofficial or lsquonaturalrsquo network also exists and has been in place for many years.

This time around it was warm and sunny throughout and the large crowd enjoyed the music in more traditional summer weather.It was a good day for piping and drumming and all the bands seem to be playing very well.It was a day for some shocks especially in the top grades with Closkelt edging out the PSNI by a single point in Grade  and then losing out to Raa in Grade  by a similar margin..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog In Grade A we had a new winning band in Thiepval Memorial who beat off the challenge of Quinn Memorial who won the drumming. In Grade B once again it was McNeillstown who just stayed ahead of the Grade A Augharan who were playing up. I have to say that McNeillstown’s strathspey ‘Wedderlie Castle’ is a breath of fresh air and I will be listening again. Augharan won Grade A ahead of nearest challengers Cullybackey while Broughshane  District won Grade B by some margin over Mountjoy and Ballyboley who had the best piping. In the drum majors there were first wins of the season for Andrea McKeown Gibson in the Adult section and Abigail Wenlock in the Juvenile. Benjamin Walker continued his recent good form in the Junior section as did Carys Graham in the Novice. The Chieftain of the Day was Alderman John Smyth, the mayor of Antrim and Newtownabbey.RESULTSGrade : st Closkelt [also Best Pipes and Bass Section], nd PSNI [also Best Drums], rd Raa [also Best MD].

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed. It feels very appropriate, given my fatherrsquos very high standards and professionalism that The Moorwell is being designed and constructed with the same values. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed to parties trying to form council policy in the wrong manner.“Procedures are there to protect the public and good governance and we will continue to follow those rules.”\"  \"  N.I. railway line

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
