The standard we walk past is the standard we accept\u0027. Prince William too was outspoken about the need to combat climate change during his sit down with Sir David Attenborough at a summit in Davos, Switzerland, last month.The Duke of Cambridge urged the global elite to tackle urgent environmental issues to preserve the planet for future generations.Speaking last November, the Prince of Wales also condemned the destruction of the planet, saying \u0027businesses and iniduals need to get better at recycling to sort out the mess and save the planet for our grandchildren\u0027. \u0027The obscene cost of this trip is utter hypocrisy\u0027: Climate...No wonder she needed a private jet!

It was not until the 47th hour of their 48-hour hold on the pair that police say their investigation shifted and put Smollett in the frame.  On Monday, an interview Roberts had landed with the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department who tore through Smollett will air. Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson reserved no mercy for Smollett as he announced the police\u0027s case against him on Thursday morning. During an extraordinary press conference, he made reference to Smollett\u0027s tearful GMA appearance and condemned it, saying he could not watch the whole thing because it \u0027angered\u0027 him.           Their interview was the first time Smollett had answered questions about the case publicly \u0027To be quite honest, it\u0027s shameful.

We knew that then but he didn\u0027t know that we knew.\u0027But yeah he helped us out when he identified them,\u0027 he said. During the interview, Smollett reacted to suspicion over his cooperation with the police investigation by insisting he was telling the truth. \u0027You do such a disservice when you lie about this kind of stuff,\u0027 he said.   Elsewhere he described himself \u0027fighting the f*** back\u0027 when he was jumped, screaming as he realized there was a noose around his neck and then calling the police with his 60-year-old friend Frank Gatson.He blamed the fact that he was being doubted on the political climate and said: \u0027The camera, facing north, how is that my issue? It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.\u0027 He also raised his voice when asked by Roberts about the fact people were suspicious he had gone out in subzero temperatures at 2am to get a salad from Subway.

It was a private visit so there was no additional cost to the British taxpayer.She is already back at work, flying the flag for Britain on a high-profile official visit to Morocco, where she and the Duke will promote diplomatic relations, boost UK interests and support humanitarian causes.Just another week in the everyday story of royal folk? Hardly. As Princess Diana’s private secretary, I learned to recognise that the line between official and private travel is never just about the money. It’s a code that opens a Pandora’s box of unintended consequences.Rich people’s jets — in this case a Gulfstream reportedly paid for by George and Amal Clooney — always come with a bill attached, even if it’s not the kind you can pay with a Duchy of Cornwall credit card.Favours must be returned, obligations quickly multiply and pretty soon royal free-riders are handing over their most precious assets: credibility and dignity, if not, please God, their lives.The uproar created in some quarters by Meghan’s brief, but undeniably extravagant, Big Apple excursion could hardly have been greater if she had run naked down Broadway and burned a Union Jack in Times Square.But let’s keep a sense of proportion here. A high-profile former actress, she happens to have rich celebrity friends and, if they behave as rich celebrities usually do, then good luck to her, surely.Anyway, other members of the Royal Family, notably Prince Charles and Camilla, have often been known graciously to accept favours from the mega-rich, especially if there’s a jet, a yacht or a private island on offer. Just don’t tactlessly mention the environmental damage.This whole subject is a high-hypocrisy zone, so instead, relax, enjoy the exotic pictures and remember the words of Jimmy Stewart’s character, the cynical hack Macaulay Connor in The Philadelphia Story: ‘The prettiest sight in this fine pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.’Royal dramas of this kind tend to fizzle out pretty quickly, fit only for tomorrow’s recycling bin.There will surely be some courtiers this morning (not least in Casablanca with the Duke and Duchess) who are trying this explanation on for size. Perhaps it will all blow over, they hope, and the British public’s love for its excitingly-disruptive American newcomer will resume undiminished.After all, it seems only yesterday that Her Royal Highness was winning hearts with her ‘bananagrams’ for sex workers in Bristol, recipe-sharing with women in the Grenfell community kitchen, and speech-making on women’s education and women’s suffrage on a hugely successful tour Down Under in October.

Five nights in a one-bedroom suite at The Mark Hotel costs $9,982.05Yet the excesses of the baby shower now threaten the benign indifference of the British public — an accident of history that is the Windsors’ most precious, but also most volatile, asset. Unfortunately for Meghan, in Windsor World it doesn’t require wicked intent to set the centuries-old edifice a-tremble: not knowing what you don’t know will do the job just as well.In this context, it’s hard to remember Meghan’s eager determination to ‘hit the ground running’ in her new royal career and not compare it with her sister-in-law Catherine’s less exciting but, in retrospect, wiser intention ‘to learn the ropes’.All Meghan’s running has brought her, at private-jet velocity, to a lonely crossroads. It’s a stark choice between the path of celebrity versus the path of duty, service and sacrifice.Did she recognise this dilemma before Prince Harry slipped that engagement ring onto her finger? As a gifted, intelligent and worldly woman, the answer is, surely, of course she did. She will also know that in marrying the Queen’s grandson, she has allied her interests with the Windsors’ instinct to protect their dynasty at any cost.          Duchess of Sussex visits  the Hubb Community Kitchen, LondonMeghan’s crossroads is as old as monarchy itself. A whole tribe of gutsy royal women have been here before her. In the last 100 years, several have been the spine and heart of the British Monarchy.These include: Alexandra, who endured Edward VII’s serial philandering and pioneered a new style of compassionate royal work Mary, who steeled her husband in World War I and Elizabeth the Queen Mother who did the same in WWII and the present Elizabeth, whose reign will likely never be surpassed as the standard for service before self.The common factor was a recognition that royal privilege and perks have to be paid for, not by rich chums, but by a lifetime of service to the people whose bows, curtsies and taxes will always be willingly given in return. Better make that probably willingly.Other women also passed this way. In the present reign, there has been a high failure rate of church weddings of first-rank Royal Family members. Only three, out of seven, have escaped the orce courts.One of those statistics was Harry’s mother, whose experience has hopefully also been carefully studied by Meghan. In comparing the two women, differences quickly outnumber any similarities. Diana’s 16-year royal career was already consigned to history before she reached the age Meghan is now.Meghan is no teen virgin, but a orced, media-smart and ambitious celebrity, empowered by all the arsenal of right-on feminism. Her fate is emphatically in her own hands, as it should be.Recent lurid headlines will fade, hurried on their way by the imminent arrival of what will surely be the most photogenic of babies.But that crossroads will, I predict, obstinately remain.Patrick Jephson was equerry and private secretary to HRH The Princess of Wales 1988-96.

The aim is to make it easier for the PM to face down the ERG.’Today’s intervention comes ahead of what is expected to be another critical week on Brexit.

Disentangling 46 years of membership has not been – and was never going to be – a simple task.But, as members of her Cabinet, we have seen for ourselves the extraordinary determination and resilience the Prime Minister has demonstrated in seeking to implement the result of the 2016 referendum.In the next few days, it is to be hoped that we can achieve a breakthrough in our negotiations with the EU and a new deal can be presented to Parliament. After months of uncertainty, it is time that MPs recognised the need to get a deal, accepted that this is the only deal on offer, and supported it.          Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, is seen arriving to attend a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street earlier this month  David Gauke (left), Amber Rudd (right) and Greg Clark write in today\u0027s Daily Mail: \u0027After months of uncertainty, it is time that MPs recognised the need to get a deal, accepted that this is the only deal on offer, and supported it\u0027Once the deal is passed, the benefits will be felt nationally. Optimism will surge, relief will be palpable, we will have pulled back from the damaging precipice of No Deal, and we can put the isions behind us. But too many of our parliamentary colleagues appear complacent about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal.Our economy will be damaged severely both in the short and long term. Costs will increase, businesses that rely on just-in-time supply chains will be severely disrupted, and investment will be discouraged. Obviously, trade with the EU will become harder but so will trade with important non-EU economies, such as Japan and South Korea, with whom we currently trade with the benefit of free trade agreements available for EU members.Our national security will be weakened. For example, co-operation with our EU allies depends upon the free flow of data between our authorities. Such co-operation will not be possible unless we reach agreement as to how this will work when we are outside the EU. No such agreement is in place.And the integrity of the United Kingdom would be put at risk. A No Deal Brexit will mean that those whose lives straddle the Northern IrelandRepublic of Ireland border will become much more complicated. It is already clear that moderate Nationalists who, up until now, have been reconciled to living in the United Kingdom, will increasingly see the attractions of a united Ireland. The calls for a border poll would grow stronger and, with it, the prospect of the end of the United Kingdom.          David Gauke, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark: \u0027As members of her Cabinet, we have seen for ourselves the extraordinary determination and resilience the Prime Minister has demonstrated in seeking to implement the result of the 2016 referendum\u0027In such circumstances, it does not take much of a leap in imagination to see how the Scottish separatists would seek to seize the chance to break up Great Britain, too.Far from Brexit resulting in a newly independent United Kingdom stepping boldly into the wider world, crashing out on March 29 would see us poorer, less secure and potentially splitting up.It would be truly remarkable if this was as a consequence of Conservative MPs voting down the deal. We must be the party that promotes business, protects our security and preserves the Union. None of this would be achieved by pursuing a No Deal Brexit.The Government’s policy is to leave the European Union on March 29 with a deal that protects our economic and security interests. That date is less than five weeks away and time is running out.If we cannot achieve a parliamentary breakthrough in the next few days, the country will face a choice. We could crash out on March 29 or we could try to leave with a deal at a later date. Beyond the next few days, there simply will not be time to agree a deal and complete all the necessary legislation before March 29.Our hope is that Parliament recognises that we should leave the EU on March 29 with a deal. However, if there is no breakthrough in the coming week, the balance of opinion in Parliament is clear – that it would be better to seek to extend Article 50 and delay our date of departure rather than crash out of the European Union on March 29.It is time that many of our Conservative parliamentary colleagues in the ERG recognised that Parliament will stop a disastrous No Deal Brexit on March 29. If that happens, they will have no one to blame but themselves for delaying Brexit.  Stop playing games over No Deal, Boris and Co warnedBy Jack Doyle for the Daily Mail The Tory Party was last night engulfed by bitter Brexit in-fighting over the threat of a No Deal departure.The Prime Minister will travel to an EU summit in Egypt tomorrow as she tries to secure last-ditch concessions from Brussels on her deal.But ahead of a critical week, the party is at war over whether to take control of the negotiations out of her hands to prevent No Deal.          Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell (pictured) has signalled that Labour will back a second referendum as part of a desperate bid to stop more MPs defectingJeremy Corbyn, a Eurosceptic, is believed to be opposed to a second referendum. But yesterday Mr McDonnell told the London Evening Standard: ‘On the People’s Vote, we’ve kept it on the table and we’re moving towards that.’He said Labour was ‘moving into implementation stages around our conference decision, around the People’s Vote’.Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson have devised a plan to support the PM’s Brexit deal on the condition it is put to a confirmatory public vote. The Commons could be asked to vote on the Kyle-Wilson amendment next week.Mr McDonnell said that any referendum would have remaining in the European Union as the alternative to the deal.‘If we were going on a People’s Vote based on a deal that has gone through Parliament in some form, if that got voted down then you’d have status quo, and that would be Remain,’ he said.          Jeremy Corbyn (pictured), a Eurosceptic, is believed to be opposed to a second referendumThe Shadow Chancellor said that if it was an option ‘I’d campaign for Remain and I’d vote for Remain’. A spokesman for the People’s Vote campaign said: ‘It looks like Labour will test whether its Brexit plan has the support of Parliament next week.‘If they back compromise proposals to put any final Brexit deal to the people, it will help unite their party, as well as avoid the catastrophe for their constituents of a No Deal departure from the EU.’Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn was setting out his Brexit plans in Madrid at the Party of European Socialists meeting. He said: ‘The damaging deadlock on Brexit must be broken and following my discussions with EU leaders and officials, I am in no doubt that Labour’s alternative plan is credible.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg meets Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright harmful online content","story":"Revealed: Facebook \u0027allows advertisers to target users...Monster’s INK!

Pensioners were arrested. It was an unholy mess.Despite that terrible publicity, Sheffield is not the worst offender. Newcastle has so far destroyed many more, butchering almost 8,500 trees in three years — nearly twice as many as any other local authority. The council trotted out the usual line that the trees are only cut ‘for good reason or necessity’, and that replanting schemes are carried out. What makes me really laugh is the idea that these councils are replanting more ‘manageable’ trees. As if they were some worn-out council van.Even the National Trust has assured those who despair at the felling of the magnificent avenue at Kingston Lacy in Dorset that they will be ‘replacing’ them with hawthorns.Admittedly, trees grow more quickly than many imagine, but nonetheless a great tree, a gnarled, fat beauty, spreading its canopy scores of feet above our heads, won’t just arrive out of a box.A real getaway! Private island in Alaska complete with a...Dream comes true for the man who honoured his heroes:...Share this articleHow many of us have despaired at the poor saplings left to die in inadequately maintained slots in the pavement, having been swiftly planted then abandoned, job done, to wither or get vandalised in the vital first few years of their lives? Even if these feeble twigs survive, they won’t become something amazing for many, many years.It’s happening by our roadsides, too. Scores of trees have been chopped down, for example — to the astonishment and horror of residents — alongside the A14 in Cambridgeshire as the road is upgraded.Even railway companies have got in on the act, with many people up in arms over the hacking down of thousands of trees along the Great Western mainline from London through Berkshire and beyond.They’ve been sacrificed to make way for what critics call ‘brutally ugly and intrusive’ steel gantries supporting new electric cables.That’s not an excuse the chef Gordon Ramsay can call on. He recently got in hot water when it emerged he’s angered neighbours at his Cornwall holiday home with plans to cut down a pair of 100-year-old trees to make way for his sports cars.          Magnificent: An avenue of trees in Kingston Lacy, Dorset. We need to think for a moment about what a miracle it is that these wondrous natural phenomena existWe need to think for a moment about what a miracle it is that these wondrous natural phenomena exist. And then we need to start treasuring them.I’m reminded of this every day in the London square where I live. In spring, the view from my upstairs window is a curtain of rippling green from top to bottom.I have a little print that shows the trees in the central garden were planted around 1800. It was a different world then. The buildings dominated a bare patch of scrub.Now, the glory of this oasis of Central London is these huge, gorgeous organic giants. The buildings are clothed and adorned and wreathed in their magnificence.Every year, our gutters fill with their sexual awakenings, every year we watch in awe as they follow the changing of the season. The London plane tree was seen as a hedge against smoke pollution. Its flaking bark was believed to protect against soot. It doesn’t specifically do that, but it does allow the tree to renew and thrive.The trees refresh the very air we breathe. They help prevent flooding across the city. They are part of what is officially designated by the United Nations as ‘a forest’ — the forest of London. The leaves do fall. Magnificently. In high winds, a few twigs and branches dislodge. Pollen can make you sneeze.Do I, even for a moment, consider that we should lose any of these great beauties as a result?My foundations are under far more threat from a bitcoin millionaire who wants to undermine our shaky Georgian joint walls with a new sub-basement next door — sanctioned by, yes, you guessed it, the council — than they are from any tree roots.What happens if the trees die? How are they maintained? Enter the ‘tree surgeon’.I myself have just felled four big willows in Suffolk that had sprouted in a wood. But there is a difference between thinning and felling.If you ask a man with a vested interest whether a tree might at some point lose a branch which might conceivably fall on a human being, who might, perchance, be walking underneath at that moment, or whether that tree over there might be sending its roots to damage someone’s house over there, the inevitable answer will be ‘yes’. No doubt followed by ‘pay me a sum of money and I will get rid of it for you’.It is a classic Catch-22. If you ask ‘should that tree come down?’, the almost inevitable reply seems to be ‘yes’. Is this the mentality that has driven all those councils to call for the chainsaws?I lost a huge ash in my place in Suffolk because of such a gloomy diagnosis. Yes, there was rot. Yes, big high branches were looking rough. But I have always felt that discretion was by no means the better part of valour.Despite recycling the tree into a lovely floor and beautiful furniture, something toppled in me when that mighty tree was felled.It was followed shortly by a neighbour’s two ‘diseased’ 150-year-old oaks nearby.When it came to another big boy, I suggested proper surgery instead. We lost the bigger branches and some of the rotten upper stem, and the truncated tree has now started growing a new canopy.Trees are capable of renewal and resurgence even in extreme age.In a Llangernyw Churchyard in Conwy, five years ago, I went to visit a tree that had started growing before Stonehenge was built.It is a yew so wrinkled, so battered and so scarred that it was like a record of time itself. The centre had rotted and hollowed so much that the church wardens had once stuck their oil tank inside it.On a hillside above the River Wye, I sat beside an ash stool (stump) that had started its life when Jesus Christ was walking the Earth.I fear that had it been up to a ‘consultant’, both would have been felled as diseased, useless, dangerous or more probably ‘nearly dead anyway’ 1,000 years ago.We can build almost anything in a couple of years. But a tree? No. Impossible. An oak tree starts its magnificent maturity only after 120 years, when its growth slows. It can take a rest lasting 300 years, then have another growth and life until it is 1,000 years old, and it looks wonderful.A great tree is a testament to life. The triumphant joy these huge plants engender is one of the wonders of the world. Their roots reach back into history.Two or three hundred years in the making and still flourishing, many are themselves the creators and adornments of the landscapes in which they stand.Far from massacring these marvels, I have often wondered why we do not insist by law that there are more trees planted to accompany our new building. It wasn’t a problem for the Victorians. The garden squares and avenues they created were essential, affordable soul-comfort.As president of Civic Voice, the league of amenity societies, with more than 350,000 vocal members, I find that the major worry about the building of new houses and flats is not that it’s happening, but that it is done so sloppily, so grimly and so greedily.The cost of land makes the developer stick up as many new homes as possible, as close to the main road as possible, especially when filling in around villages.Why can’t we plan our new suburban lives more carefully around and within woods and forest, masking sound, integrating housing into the landscape, hiding buildings from the rest of the countryside? We should legislate that any major development should have room not just for street trees, but copses and thickets around and within it, too.We need more trees, not fewer.And, thank you, I am perfectly aware that this sounds wasteful of space. But the typical 18th century garden square in Edinburgh, Newcastle or Bath is formed of a dense block of high-rise terrace housing facing a communal garden. They didn’t waste space. They enhanced it. And trees were essential to doing this.In the modern age, road engineers, naive councils seeking to big up their commercial centres, Seventies planners, car park companies, urban planners and now ‘pedestrianisers’ — ‘plansters’ as the poet John Betjeman loved to call them — have bashed up, wrecked, trashed and overwhelmed our high streets with vast shopping centres, grim administrative buildings, goods entrances and ring roads.What astounds me is that, as I wander outwards from these grey, misbegotten hell-holes, I find that the leafy backlands of Sheffield or Belfast, Liverpool or Ipswich suddenly reveal places of great peace and private order. Houses are well maintained. Gardens are thick with ancient evergreens.Huge trees march along quiet roads and testify to the continuity, comfort and restfulness of Acacia Avenue and Hartland Road.Is this why they so annoy so-called forward thinkers? They are proof of an innate private and very personal conservatism.If a tree has stood undisturbed for 150 years, then this whole area has clearly evaded the improvers.Too safe, too leafy, too settled, too lovely, too soothing and too pleasant for too long.Time to do something about it. Let’s cut the trees down.Are trees really destroying roads and pathways with their damned roots? Who cares? Raise your asphalt. It is hypocritical anyway. Aren’t these the same councils installing bumps and lumps across highways to stall traffic?I am half-convinced the appalling state of the surface of roads in parts of London is a hidden campaign to disable the motor car anyway. But that lumpy moonscape has actually been caused by unmonitored, shoddy, get-rich-quick merchants pulling up the highway to install cables and ducts.Well, we may daily negotiate surfaces that would disgrace the suburbs of Nairobi, and spend money on clumsily designed mis-matched cycle lanes, but woodman, leave our trees alone.It is not their fault. Don’t blame them. Leaves on the road are really not the problem.So I salute the protesters who have chained themselves to trees in Sheffield. They have alerted us to a stupidity that ought to be correctable.Recently, central government has been making noises that they might do something. We have to march to stop the inanity of councils chopping down our city trees.Get on with it, Mr Gove. It is already too late for some."},{"url":null,"title":"Holiday prices slashed 50 cent week Britains withdrawal EU","story":"The TRUE cost of Meghan\u0027s baby shower: Friends may have...Its incendiary findings about racism in the Met shook the...Share this articleAmong the most affordable Easter holiday deals is a seven-day trip to the Algarve for a family of four at £432.This is more than £200 cheaper – a 23 per cent drop – than last year’s best deal, which was a week in Benidorm at £668.Another bargain is a seven-night stay on the Costa Brava in north-east Spain, also for a family of four, for £444 – a 24 per cent discount on last year’s price.And a similar trip to Corfu in Greece should cost a family £496, which is 17 per cent less than the previous year.Meanwhile, many Britons are considering destinations as far away as Bali, Zanzibar and Jamaica.Bookings for destinations outside the European Union have increased close to 50 per cent on last year.

For remainers, it’s vital to keep ideals in mind and time to fight a bigger battleI was living in Norwich when the Brexit referendum happened. The city voted remain, an island of European feeling separated from Cambridge – the next dot in the remainer archipelago – by 60 miles of rural and small town leaverdom. One morning not long afterwards, in the small hours, a local deli selling Romanian produce was firebombed. No one was hurt, although people were sleeping in a flat over the shop when it happened. A crowdfunding appeal quickly raised almost £30,000 for the damaged business.It was a jittery and unsettling time. I doubt I was alone among remain voters in feeling, for the first week or two after the referendum, that sleep-reducing ball of anxiety in the pit of my stomach which signifies the perception not just that a deeply wrong event has occurred, but that the very framework within which events of any kind occur has been broken.I should have recognised the feeling sooner. It was a feeling I perceived intellectually, but didn’t experience personally, when I talked to people in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s about their regret for the collapse of the USSR – its economic collapse bound together with the belittlement and dissolution of its cultural landscape.It’s a feeling, I imagine, very similar to learning that the mine or factory where you and your family have worked for a generation or two is closing, or that new people who look and talk and dress differently to your people are eligible for benefits you’ve been queueing for, or that the social values that defined your youth are now officially wrong – which means, by extension, that your youth was wrong, too. And now we remainers were feeling it: people like me, who had remotely observed others, were experiencing it for ourselves. For leavers, the merit of voting to leave the EU wasn’t only in winning. It was in getting their opponents to feel loss – to feel what they had felt, that deep unease at the shattering of their representation of the world. My bad feeling was somebody else’s catharsis.I’ve been angry about Brexit. I’ve been ashamed, sometimes fearful, often bored by the futility and pettiness of it all. As I write, although the fight goes on for a second-thoughts referendum, it seems likely Britain won’t be in the European Union by year’s end – perhaps as soon as the end of next month – and I’ll be angry, ashamed and fearful again. These feelings are forgivable. What isn’t forgivable, however, is bitterness.If and when Brexit happens, I don’t want to be a remainer equivalent of Rush Limbaugh, uttering his odious response to Barack Obama’s election as US president: “I hope he fails.” While it will be hard to forgive Boris Johnson his lies, or David Cameron his haughty recklessness, while I’ll always struggle to see Nigel Farage as anything other than the outcome of a liaison between Toad of Toad Hall and the Chief Weasel, I don’t want my dislike of the leavers’ champions hardening into a crude ideology of hatred. To fume for ever at the tricks and strength of the winners, without questioning my own, British liberal way of thinking, would be to waste one of the few opportunities Brexit offers.It’s not that the country should put aside its differences and come together: a horrible, stifling thought. It often seems, in the heat of Brexit rage, that ardent leavers and remainers have forgotten how normal it is for nations to be ided. “United” nations made up of people who agree about everything are fictions invented by authoritarian regimes. The point of democracies is not to unite a nation so that everyone is happy, but to manage the unhappiness of whoever feels they’ve lost out without resorting to civil war.A renunciation of bitterness doesn’t mean remainers giving up their struggle, either, reining in their attacks on folly and social media jiggery-pokery. It means remainers like me examining and beginning to resolve the contradictions in our own, not always rational, way of representing the world. We need to raise our eyes from Brexit and consider not just the Britain, not just the Europe, but the kind of world we are aiming for. The alternative is to end up as the remainer version of a French Bourbon aristocrat, learning nothing, forgetting nothing.Who are we, the remainers? We know what we don’t want, but we don’t seem sure what we do want in the long term. Matthew Goodwin, an academic and writer prominent in analysis of the deep roots of English Euroscepticism, has characterised Britain’s current political landscape as the embodiment of Michael Oakeshott’s distinction between “politics as faith” and “politics as scepticism”, moderated by the political scientist Margaret Canovan’s more optimistic version: she saw populism as pragmatic democracy’s necessary redemptive shadow.The trouble with this is that it puts all the faith and redemptive hope, all the inspiration, all the archetypes of surrogate religion, all the dreaming, on the leave side, stranding the remainers in a dreamless, materialist Britain of cold calculation and joyless efficiency.Besides being offensive to remainers, it’s inaccurate. Sure, the enlightened self-interest is there. But when the reality of EU administration is often so bumbling, awkward and lame, when the great majority of remain voters will never actually exercise the freedom to live and work on mainland Europe, isn’t there something irrational and romantic about the yearning to continue to be “part of Europe” – an act of faith, a response to impulses in one’s political unconscious?When I try to interrogate my own inclinations honestly, I find not only rational, pragmatic fears of Brexit, not only the personal legacy of past trans-European love affairs and a brother with a German wife living in Berlin, but a more intangible and perhaps not altogether wholesome dream of power and abandonment. This is the dream of being at once an element in a vast, variegated, rich continent, and of losing myself in wanderings in the furthest and least fashionable corners of that continent. It does not seem either rational or pragmatic, but nor is it “wrong”.Remainers, on the whole, aspire to a morality that is universal. We are liberals. We endorse the principle of the right to cultural self-determination not just for the native English, but for all peoples. At the same time we support other abstract, universal principles – women’s rights, sexual minority rights, ethnic minority rights, animal rights, children’s rights, the primacy of environmental protection, migrant rights, equal opportunities, education for all, democracy. Some liberals believe in free trade, free movement of people or free movement of capital.I have to face the truth that these strands are deeply contradictory. A belief in the imperative to conserve the traditional, authentic and distinctive in local cultures clashes with an equally fervent promotion of universal rights and freedoms. This is the liberal bourgeois dilemma: an irreconcilable desire for both universality and particularity.British liberals both supported large-scale coal mining as the enabler of traditional, authentic, working-class communities, and abominated it as global warming’s lead culprit. Only an accident of history allowed these sentiments to be consecutive, rather than concurrent. Liberals prize the authentically local, the person or product or way of being that is truly, traditionally, of place we are sad and angry when that authenticity is cheapened, commercialised, tainted by globalism, even though our own restless, flocking quest for local authenticity in multiple locations each year contributes to the very globalism that torments us.And there are consequences. At the libertarian, neoliberal end of liberalism, there are occasional personal shocks for those whose wealth usually enables them to keep the contradictions at a distance. A friend who prospered as a fund manager in London stepped back from finance and became involved in a worthy British charity helping to empower young people. On her way to a meeting of the organisation in a northern English town, the taxi driver began telling her of the area’s economic woes and she realised the multinational responsible for hurting the people she was trying to help was one of the companies she’d invested her clients’ money in.At the communitarian end – the part of the liberal spectrum where I like to think I reside – there’s a tendency to assume “good” localism (the ideal of the “thriving local community”, locally sourced food, preservation of vernacular local architecture and the traditional local landscape) can be neatly separated from “bad” localism (hostility to immigrants and new ways of doing things). But can it? The trickiest contradiction in the remainer-liberal view is the European Union itself. British liberals like to see support for remaining in the EU as a marker, of and by itself, of good universal values: openness, receptiveness to other cultures and ideas, freedom for people to move and work in different places, widely pooled security. Indeed, Britain in the EU does approach these values more nearly than Britain on its own. But they aren’t applied universally. Britain, on its own, is an exclusionary, overwhelmingly white, post-Christian society Britain in the EU is part of a larger, overwhelmingly white, post-Christian society that still excludes 14 out of 15 of the world’s population from freely moving, living or working there.In the wake of the Brexit vote a number of EU citizens living in Britain have had horrible experiences with the immigration authorities. But the experiences of the Windrush generation, people who have lived in Britain for decades and find themselves officially persecuted, in some cases forcibly expelled to countries they were brought from as children, happened while Britain was still in the EU. Two hundred people a month are dying trying to illegally cross the EU’s closed external borders.Most remainers I know feel it’s a strong enough stance on openness to be firm in their insistence on free movement within Europe, firm on the rights of migrants and refugees, and vague on the ideal degree of permeability of the external borders of the jurisdiction in which they live. There aren’t many takers for absolute global freedom of movement. But to spell out the exact nature and justification of the consequent limits to absolute freedom provokes in liberals a fear of infection with the disease of racial exclusivity. The shudders that greeted Gordon Brown’s “British jobs for British workers” comment, or Jeremy Corbyn’s complaint of “wholesale importation of underpaid workers from central Europe”, are proof enough.The idea that remain voters were winners who only cared about themselves and leave voters were losers screaming for help is simplistic. Most remain voters don’t deny the damage the country has suffered since the crash of 2008, if not earlier.The damage is economic and cultural. Economically, high-status non-graduate jobs with good pay and conditions have been replaced by low-status jobs with bad pay and conditions, housing has become scarcer and more expensive, taxpayer-funded public services such as health, education, police and the criminal justice system have got worse, and privatised user-funded public services such as water and energy have increased in cost to the benefit of their mainly overseas owners. Culturally, distinctiveness of place is being erased by a creeping uniformity whose paradoxical hallmark is a shallow ersity. In a narrow sense the blame for these ills is distributed differently one side blames immigration and the EU, the other, austerity and globalisation.Sometimes since the Brexit referendum I’ve sensed the ergent dreams of leavers and remainers reducing to the same primal personal desire, the desire to live in a community that is naturally, effortlessly kind to them and their families – one where a structural benignity of laws, customs and officialdom is matched by a social benignity of shared outlook and common values. Among some leavers floats a dream of Britain as an island purged of incomers – out with the Muslim, the Pole, the Russian oligarch and his dirty money. Remainers are haunted by a dream of sanctuary, of some other country marvellously preserving the spirit of a more generous and tolerant society, ready to make available for a select few Britons that freedom and openness of outlook Britain has lost for ever. “I’m trying to get an Irish passport.” “I’m eligible for German citizenship.” “I’m going to be spending more time at my house in Spain. This country’s finished.”When “dream” refers to your representation of the world, it’s not a state you’re going to wake from. The disruption to your dream comes otherwise not only in the form of a momentous event like military defeat, imperial collapse, workplace disappearance or Brexit. It comes when you can’t avoid awareness that your dream clashes with another’s: when the remainer beds deeply in her new home abroad only to find that there, too, resentment of the outsider and the cosmopolitan runs deep, and she encounters local versions of the dark island dream of purification she fled. Where, now, in the world is a sanctuary for tolerance more reliable than the one you might get if you spoke up for the values you claim to hold in the place you already are? In a US where almost a hundred million adults think Donald Trump is doing a good job? In a France where a third of the electorate wanted the virulently anti-immigrant Eurosceptic Marine Le Pen as president? In a Denmark which is establishing immigrant ghettos where different laws apply?For the leavers and their island dream, it’s harsher. They know their exclusionary dream clashes with the sanctuary-seeking dream of immigrants and refugees from other countries – people who yearn not just for better-paid work than at home but for a refuge from corruption and extreme pro-rich policies that render basic public services in their countries weak, patchy or non-existent.Whatever course the Brexit process now takes, the future for those who believe themselves tolerant and outward-looking, but who resist Britain’s economic and cultural corrosion, must be to continually challenge acceptance of a world where the ision of the spoils of labour varies so wildly from one country to the next. The failed liberal slogan for the world that sounded so loudly in the afterclap of communism’s fall – “Democracy and the free market” – lacks the Robin Hood kicker: democracy, trade and fairly shared wealth.The scale to measure the success of globalisation shouldn’t be how easily the wealthiest can suck rents from the majority and keep the proceeds through a combination of capital mobility, tax havens and wage suppression, by shuffling production, populations and profits from national jurisdiction to national jurisdiction. It should be by how far the world as a whole approaches a high baseline of shared security and prosperity, within which cultural distinctiveness can flourish – how far Indonesia or China or Egypt are reaching up to establish universal networks such as education, healthcare, housing, water and energy supply how far Britain, the United States or Italy are levelling down and where the levels meet.As the world is, if a country reneges on the trappings of democracy, doesn’t hold free elections, arrests and tortures dissenters, crushes minorities, starts invading its neighbours and smothers free speech, it can expect, at the minimum, odium from the global human rights establishment, at worst sanctions, even (if it’s small and weak) military action. Similarly, if a poor country reneges on its commitment to open markets and trade, it will be hung out to dry by the global financial system.No similar set of responses, not even a conceptual framework, exists by which intensively networked societies such as Britain or Japan – countries, that is, that have universal networks of health, education, welfare and so on, built and maintained on the basis of wealth shared through taxation – might pressurise the wealthy elite of other nations to share more of their wealth with the mass of their own people. If sanctions are the weapons of global democracy, and capital flight the weapon of global finance, what might the weapon of global social justice be? Perhaps a global wealth tax perhaps something like tariffs, tied to a global minimum wage.This doesn’t sound terribly exciting, until you think about the consequences, and reflect on where we in Britain might be now if, before the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU, Brussels had brought in a Europe-wide minimum wage, pegged to west European living standards. As we prepare to leave the EU, the discourse of the most prominent Brexiters, who are almost all Conservatives, is thick with neo-imperialist gobbledygook about global trade. Their opponents, scattered through the parties, must not think on a smaller scale.The best way for remainers to avoid bitterness over being deprived of membership of the EU is not to settle for less, but to ask for more. Not to grimly resent the construction of Britain as a fortress against immigration by mourning our departure from a bigger fortress – Europe – but to ask why life needs be so grim outside the fortresses that those outside try so hard to get in.• Dreams of Leaving and Remaining by James Meek will be published by Verso on 5 April (£16.99).

The Midnight Hour (Chicken House), from storytelling partners Benjamin Read and Laura Trinder, features bold Emily, who’s lost both parents somewhere in the Midnight Hour, a dark Victorian London suspended for ever in time and inhabited by the mysterious Night Folk. As she encounters an embodied Library, a policeman with superpowers and an appalling predator, Emily grapples with what it may cost to find and save her family. Anarchic humour, rich imagination and poetic writing, interspersed with elegant line drawings, add up to pure delight – with a stowaway hedgehog as a bonus.More wildness, witchcraft and forthright, sparky girls appear in Michelle Harrison’s A Pinch of Magic (Simon \u0026amp Schuster). The Widdershins sisters, Betty, Fliss and Charlie, long to range further than their rambunctious granny’s inn, but they are trapped on the Isle of Crowstone by the dying curse of a woman of power. Can they win their freedom with the help of their birthright gifts – a bag, a mirror and a set of nesting dolls, each with its own pinch of magic? Gutsy and rude, full of warts-and-all family love, Harrison’s latest has the wry enchantment of an E Nesbit classic.There’s nothing supernatural about Jason Reynolds’ Ghost (Knights Of), first in a four-book series already beloved in the US. Ghost’s real name is Castle, but he has changed it, desperate to be unseen and hard to catch. Since the night his father tried to kill him and his mother, Ghost has had “a lot of scream inside”, as well as an impressive turn of speed. Will joining an elite track team stop the scream from bursting out? Reynolds’ writing is simple, but its impact lasts.For readers of about seven-plus, Sam Copeland’s debut Charlie Changes Into a Chicken (Puffin) is a stand-out star, offering belly-busting hilarity and a loving, light touch take on childhood anxiety. Worried about his big brother’s hospital stay, Charlie unexpectedly turns into a pigeon – then continues changing into random fauna whenever he’s stressed, be it by his nemesis or the imminent school play. A supportive cast of friends (fiendishly clever Flora in particular), subtly planted strategies for coping with worry, and some joyfully silly metanarrative tricks (including a publisher’s letter of apology) place Charlie head and shoulders above the competition Sarah Horne’s wild-haired, twitch-eyed illustrations add another layer to the fun.In Alex Milway’s Hotel Flamingo (Piccadilly), meanwhile, little Anna Dupont has inherited the run-down hotel of the title – but it’s a far cry from its glory days. With diligence, tact (especially in handling irascible chef Madame la Pig), courage and kindness, Anna soon has the Flamingo shipshape again. But will it satisfy the feline inspector? Crammed full of characterful animal illustrations with accents of zinging pink, this flamboyant early chapter book is a splendid, unpreachy testament to the power of hard work.From Bloomsbury, Fantastically Great Women Who Worked Wonders is the third in Kate Pankhurst’s colourful picture-book celebrations of notable females with their playful use of speech bubbles and perspective shifts, they remain significantly more engaging and inspiring than the rival Rebel Girls. This collection of pioneering entomologists, aeronauts and surgeons is not just the usual suspects – the lineup includes Sophie Blanchard, Maria Sibylla Merian and Rosa May Billinghurst.Sophie Blackall’s Caldecott-winning Hello Lighthouse (Orchard) is sophisticated, joyous and melancholy, and evokes, via its crashing waves and seductive cross-sections, a tremendous sense of place and time. The lighthouse’s sporadic flashes of greeting (“Hello! … Hello! … Hello!”) welcome first the new keeper and then his wife, who love their tall home in all weathers, especially when their baby is born there. But once the light is automated, the family must leave. A secret fold-out at the end makes for a breathtaking conclusion to this beautiful picture book, rich in saturated ink and pellucid watercolour.A little boy and his lovably naughty pet dragon Zibbo enjoy roaring, adventurous fun in Steve “Mr Panda” Antony’s new book, Amazing (Hodder). The hero uses a wheelchair, the supporting cast is quietly and intriguingly erse, but this is a story about the shared joys of imagination rather than one focused on disability as something “special” to be set apart and examined. It’s a blast – especially when Zibbo gets excited about blowing out candles.More exuberant cheerfulness blazes from The Truth About Old People by Elina Ellis (Two Hoots). “They” may say old people are slow, not bendy and not much fun – but Ellis’s noisy, bright, dynamic pages, filled with grandparents riding rollercoasters, smooching, dancing and flipping whole stackfuls of pancakes, assert that the elderly, too, can be anarchically amazing.In YA, Fierce Fragile Hearts (Macmillan), Sara Barnard’s magnificent sequel lives up to her bestselling debut, Beautiful Broken Things. Close friends Caddy, Rosie and Suzanne are parting ways while the former are off to university, Suzanne is living independently, alone for the first time. Navigating the legacy of her abusive childhood, including PTSD, is hard – but although there may be no quick fix, Suzanne’s strength, hard-won self-knowledge and her friends’ love will help her forge a future. Likely to induce at least one crying fit, and also dryly funny.Told in the third-person present, Sharon Dogar’s Monsters (Andersen), an account of Mary Shelley’s revolutionary life and artistic development, is poignant, lush and satisfying – a thought-provoking book. Immersing the reader by turns in the perspectives of Mary, her step-sister Claire, and husband Percy Shelley, it demonstrates how the pain of grief, abandonment and public censure might prepare the ground for the creation of monsters. The loss of Mary’s first child is especially vivid.The Love and Lies of Rukhsana Ali (Scholastic) by Sabina Khan features another strong-willed, rule‑breaking girl suffering for the freedom to love. Rukhsana’s conservative parents don’t permit crop tops, parties or alcohol – and when they discover Rukhsana has a girlfriend, she is promptly sent to Bangladesh to be married off. But she finds an unlikely ally in her grandmother … Though nuance is occasionally lacking, the book’s focused anger and defiance, and the detail of lives blighted by rigid notions of “honour”, give it considerable power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0475fa0a8efbeb57d21798ce6cb76e865080a43/0_160_3019_1811/master/3019.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7daedab6ddba606a1da3d3b781cb1414","title":"david peace made in ossett","story":"The author reflects on his youthful dreams of exile in Paris and Berlin and leaving for the bright lights of WakefieldI suppose I must have been “made” in a bungalow on Deneside in Ossett, probably around the time England were winning the World Cup in 1966. My mother used to say they should put a blue plaque on the side of the house this was long before I had published a book.Teaching brought my mother to Ossett and marriage has kept her there. My father is Ossett born and bred and has lived there almost every one of his 82 years. I barely managed 18. I couldn’t wait to leave first to Wakefield, then to Manchester, next to Istanbul, and finally to Tokyo. But I think I would have gone anywhere, just to get away from Ossett. I thought there was nothing there. Or only bad things. But I was wrong, that wasn’t true.Ossett was the centre of my world, the home I always went back to: after the football in Huddersfield, the cinema in Dewsbury, gigs in Wakefield or exhibitions in Leeds, it was always back to my bedroom in Ossett. This was the place where I first began to write stories. Because of the comics in the paper shop, the books in the local library and the house, and because nearby, on the same street as my grandmother, lived Stan Barstow, the novelist. I never met or even saw him, but his books and his proximity were an inspiration writing didn’t seem such an unusual thing to do in Ossett. Still, that didn’t stop me having my head turned by the likes of Samuel Beckett and Nick Cave, dreaming of Paris, Berlin and exile.So as soon as I could, I upped sticks for the bright lights of Wakefield, all of three miles away. The night before I left, I went for a farewell drink in the Red Lion on Dewsbury Road. An old bloke at the bar warned me of “those Wakefield folk with their Wakefield ways”, then he gripped my arm and said, “never forget where you’re from, lad. You’re from Ossett, remember that.”• David Peace’s Patient X is published in paperback by Faber.

In later years, her sexuality made her retreat againOne Sunday I came to sit with the dead. The room was almost untouched. Everything and nothing was the same. I was standing in my grandmother’s study. She had lived with us for 25 years, and died six months earlier. Her room had been cleaned and closed – the dark beetles of dried blood scrubbed from the fireplace where she fell and cracked her head. I had come to her room to sit with the silence.I have always found something deeply compelling about keeping quiet. It began when my grandmother moved in with us, when I was a child. Or at the edge of being a child: 13. The move shifted the family dynamic. It was a time of great upheaval, and it was during this time that I lost the ability to speak. Or not to speak, precisely, but to speak in the ways that make us human. The ways that matter. I could answer direct questions. I could take part in school plays. But I stopped making conversation for nearly a year. When I was at school, I stopped telling jokes, or asking questions. I became a lurker – always almost invisible, on the edge of conversations.When my grandmother moved in with us there was a corrosion: of privacy, space and time, which meant not everything was spoken. I wanted to try to compensate for some of the things unsaid. “I’m getting married,” I whispered to the listening room.I never told my grandmother I had got engaged. My parents admired my new engagement ring as we sat beside her hospital bed. I wish she had known. But I never found the words to tell her that I was marrying a woman – perhaps fearing her understanding of a wedding was not elastic enough to contain two brides at the altar. In the years since I had come out she had come to develop a simultaneous soft spot for my girlfriend and utter horror of the idea of our sexual intimacy. So there was always something unspoken. I couldn’t blame her. I only gave voice to my sexuality when I was in my 30s. And even then I could barely say the words: “lesbian”, “dyke” and “bisexuality” sounded like a medical condition, so I simply muttered “I like women” to anyone who would listen. I think I hoped that if I said it enough times I could banish the shame and doubt that made it impossible to articulate.I had come to my grandmother’s room to try to find something to read at the wedding. I scanned the shelves aimlessly, picking open old copies of Rupert Brooke, and anthologies of 20th-century love poetry. None of it was quite right. And then I saw it, an old book of mine, by George Oppen. A little known poet of the US west and east coasts. He prided himself on saying it as it was. On stripping everything back so that language could get as close as possible to the world. But at the same time his writing is incredibly sparse. It is almost as if he doesn’t want words to get in the way of the thing he is describing. The poems sit like little insects on the pages. Dots against the endless white.I began to read, and my eye was drawn to one of the shorter poems. It was written about his wife Mary.That this is I,Not mine, which wakesTo where the presentSun pours in the present, to the air perhapsOf love and of Conviction.I knew I had found it. That moment of bright optimism, and wanting to hold on to each other without taking ownership: “I, not mine”. These were the words I wanted to say.That day in my grandmother’s study reignited my romance with Oppen. But as I reread his poetry on my way to and from work, I discovered that there was a silence at the heart of his writing. Between 1934 and 1962 he didn’t publish a word of poetry. His letters also stop abruptly in the 1930s, resuming decades later. During this silence, his life continued apace: he joined the Communist party before going to war, when he fought the advance of Hitler during the 40s, only to return, wounded, to the US, and fall under the suspicion of Senator McCarthy. And so he fled to Mexico, and lived as an exile for almost a decade, with his wife and daughter, before returning to the States in 1958. For all of this, there are no words. Or at least, there are no words written at the time. In the poetry and letters written in the later years of his life, Oppen begins to pick through everything that happened, sifting through and making sense of it all.I couldn’t understand Oppen’s silence – and why a poet hailed as a “serious craftsman” by Ezra Pound with “a sensibility not got out of other men’s books”, would stop writing for so long, only to win the Pulitzer once he started again, in 1968. I think perhaps I wanted to understand his silence so I could start to make sense of why I had stopped speaking, all those years ago.Those silent years had been haunting me. As I sat in my grandmother’s study, I could see myself in the Volvo, on the long drive to secondary school, where silence first settled on me. It was a girls’ boarding school, and I was one of only three day girls in a year of nearly 100. From the start I felt like an outsider. For the first two weeks of term, the boarders were not permitted to call home. Instead, they wrote letters to their parents, and arrived in chapel red-eyed every morning. After this hiatus, they were allowed 10 minutes a week to use the public pay phone in the corridor.Leaving school each evening became a guilty secret. I never announced when I was going, but slipped silently away. And I began to hide in the boot room during breakfast, waiting for a moment when I could slip into line unnoticed. Trunks and tuck boxes were stacked to the ceiling and the air smelt of sweat and linseed oil. No one was ever there for more than a few minutes – to collect a lacrosse stick or a textbook.“Oh, hi,” they would say, “I didn’t see you there.”“Yeah, sorry, I was just leaving,” I’d reply.My days were bookended by awkward pauses, and as time went on the silence began to swell, until I found I had nothing to say. I never intended to stop talking – but soon keeping quiet became a habit. It felt safer, easier, somehow to say the bare minimum. I was never bullied – just ignored.And then my father’s company had a reshuffle and he was made redundant. Silence closed over our house, and we were told not to tell anyone outside the family what was going on. In school the other girls went skiing and hung out on the Kings Road – no one else was living off credit cards and crossed fingers. “Blood runs thicker than water,” my mother had said, as she finished breakfast one morning, “and people don’t need to know about Daddy.”I couldn’t find the words to tell my family what was happening at school it seemed irrelevant in the face of their sadness. And at school, I knew not to talk about the sadness in our unheated house – so I didn’t. I took an involuntary step back from the world, and stopped telling anyone how I was feeling.Oppen, too, stopped writing in a moment of crisis. For him, it was being confronted with the grinding poverty of the Great Depression. He had been travelling in France, setting up a publishing house with his new wife, and living off his inheritance. But he returned to the US to find snaking soup kitchen lines, of men with nothing to eat. Fifteen million families were faced with the threat of imminent starvation, and, by 1934, 20 million people were unemployed. The previously self-assured young poet was at a loss. How could he write when all around him families were struggling to survive?These were real, ethical questions for Oppen. In his one published essay on the purpose of poetry, The Mind’s Own Place, he recalls the words of the dramatist Bertolt Brecht, who believed that there were times when “it can be almost a crime to write of trees”. There are, Oppen argued, situations “that cannot honourably be met by art”. Poetry was not an appropriate response to starvation. And so he and his wife Mary took up politics with a view to creating “disorder, disorder – to make it impossible to allow people to starve”.There was a power in choosing not to speak during this time. Oppen explained his silence as a way of preventing his words from being used in the service of the communist propaganda machine. And yet, there was more to his silence: shame. He came from a wealthy Jewish background, and told one correspondent he was “born of a couple of rather millionaire lines”, and it seems to me that part of his reluctance to write about the Depression is because of this inheritance. His moneyed childhood was at odds with his life as a communist agitator in the 1930s. And so there was always something he held back. An element of his life that remained unsaid. As Mary admitted, in a later interview, the couple’s financial security was the “guilty secret”, that allowed them to risk arrest on a picket line – as nothing mattered quite as much when you had money.It was shame, too, that seeded my early silence. And shame that kept my sexuality quiet for so long, obscured even from myself. Perhaps it was only in getting married – standing up and saying “this is who I am” – that I really made peace with everything that had that had gone before.The irony is I can’t remember most of what we said during the ceremony. We had not written our own vows, preferring instead the ones they give out at the register office a laminated piece of paper passed from hand to hand. We wanted to participate in a ritual bigger than our own made up promises. So the words were demotic. Spoken. Not written. The moments I remember are more physical the registrar asking us to hold hands – and being transported back to our second date, and the way our fingertips had touched, which was the first physical intimation that I had been right, and all the telling and retelling had been worth it.The words I remember from the day are Oppen’s the poet who always endeavoured to write poetry that was truthful, and who, in the end, emerged from silence because he believed poetry had a duty to bear witness to the world. For us, he bore witness to the bright certainty of love – “That this is I, not mine” – and the hope that from now on things would be different.• Unspeakable: The Things We Cannot Say by Harriet Shawcross is published by Canongate on 7 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/152bcb210df7871a080ed6baae8368a96b33b7b4/0_177_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42f0473dc697ee8171ba202af1483e38","title":"amazon new york headquarters corporate power balance","story":"By rejecting the logic that cities should bend over backwards to welcome corporations, New Yorkers asserted a principle that has long been lackingBetween November 2018 and February 2019, the world’s biggest corporation (Amazon) and the US’s biggest city (New York) staged a bizarre, absurd and frequently infuriating public spectacle.In just three months, all of the following happened: Amazon announced they had selected New York as a location for one of their two new headquarters the deal they struck with the city and state of New York was announced groups representing workers, tenants and immigrants organized furiously against Amazon, while the mayor, the governor and the deal’s supporters scrambled to defend it several key politicians – most of whom had previously encouraged Amazon to come to New York – turned hostile to the company and then, with no notice and little fanfare, Amazon announced they were no longer pursuing New York for their corporate headquarters. The opponents had won, and Amazon was sent packing.For the past few days, New Yorkers have been celebrating or seething, depending on their position, and debating with one another about what just happened and what it all meant. Clearly, this was not just a one-off fight between an obnoxious billionaire and a pissed off populous. New York’s dizzying dance with Amazon tells us a lot about the state of urban politics in the United States, and the kind of fights we need to engage in if we want to alter the balance of corporate and people’s power.Much has been made of the fact that the US’ federal system allowed Amazon to host a competition for cities across the country to race to the bottom in order to prove they would offer the company generous subsidies, extensive tax breaks and lax regulations. This is, indeed, a travesty that should be addressed legislatively, but it is also a demonstration of the enormous power corporate capital wields in determining cities’ urban planning priorities.It also displays the shifting economic mix that US planners and policymakers are seeking to attract. Whereas, in the past, cities were accused of “smokestack chasing”, or devising competitive packages to lure factories from one town the next, cities are now engaging in “skyscraper chasing”, or seeking massive investments in real estate (in this case under the auspices of tech industry growth).Around the country, we have witnessed the rise of the real estate state, a faction of government whose interests are always aligned with escalating land and property values. At the municipal level, we see planners presenting gentrification as a public good to be encouraged at the national level, we witness the election of a luxury developer to our highest office. Amazon sought to capitalize on this frenzy, and rightly predicted that politicians across the country would devise ways to welcome them and the real estate capital they summon.The particular siting of the proposed New York City Amazon headquarters was telling. Long Island City, Queens, had been the target of planned deindustrialization for over 35 years, with a succession of governors and mayors seeking to displace manufacturing and incentivize a proliferation of bland corporate office and luxury residential developments.In the 1980s, Mayor Ed Koch and Governor Mario Cuomo – the father of contemporary New York governor and Amazon apologist Andrew Cuomo – turned up the heat by providing a billion-dollar subsidy to a mixed-use development called Hunters Point South. The next mayor, David Dinkins, presented a Waterfront Plan that encouraged a wholesale transformation of the area, and his successor, Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, offered generous subsidies for companies such as MetLife to locate there.The pace of luxury development accelerated rapidly under Mayor Michael Bloomberg after his 2001 rezoning. By luring Amazon to this particular place, Cuomo and the mayor, Bill de Blasio, were building on a long legacy of marginalizing manufacturing and courting gentrification.Ultimately, however, Bezos, Cuomo and De Blasio failed – they could not secure the consent of the people, who conducted a forceful and multi-fronted battle on the issues of housing costs, labor and immigrant rights, corporate subsidies, infrastructure demands, small business survival, and more. In so doing, the anti-Amazon movement presented an anti-corporate, anti-gentrification mantel for other cities to pick up. In fact, since New Yorkers successfully stood up to Amazon, protests in northern Virginia – Amazon’s other top choice – have intensified.By rejecting the logic that cities should bend over backwards to welcome gentrifying, union-busting, homogenizing corporations, New Yorkers asserted a principle that has long been lacking in planning: that the public is the rightful steward of a city’s future.That may sound obvious, but it is a major turnabout from ordinary planning practice, which has tended to privilege the rights of property owners and seek little more than advice and consent from the rest of us. Public stewardship, on the other hand, is the contention that the city is a collective product of residents’ labor –in terms of the material production of streets and buildings, the cultural production of neighborhoods and common spaces, and the social reproduction of residents and workers. The city’s fate belongs with those who made it, not just those who own it.If cities are products of collective labor, then gentrification, in geographer Ipsita Chatterjee’s phrase, is “the theft of space from labor and its conversion into spaces of profit”. Anti-gentrification movements like the one that scared away Amazon can be understood as part of the long legacy of working class struggle against the alienation of labor by capital. In the classic cases, workers have revolted against bosses for stealing the surplus value they created here, residents are rising up against developers and politicians for alienating people from the spaces they have built.The city is an expression of popular will, and that will can be summoned to upturn the plans of those who seek to usurp its labor. This kind of mobilization is key to beating back corporate power and resisting the rise of the real estate state. With Amazon on the run, the time is ripe to renew our push for public stewardship and rethink the purpose of urban planning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4db03683025e1d05b8c4e69d7abf3b228fec2c7d/0_251_4564_2738/master/4564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b51ebc796a9563bdcf462cc06dfce0","title":"oscars life support academy mess","story":"The Academy is in such a mess that guests may need to dip into their goodie bags for some alternative therapy on SundayIt’s the fifth big capitulation since last year’s awards, with reverse-ferrets on plans to introduce a popular film category, to bin some original-song performances, to stop previous winners presenting key awards and to hire a homophobic host. This after their nerves were already shot by Faye Dunaway announcing the wrong film as best picture winner in 2017 – not to mention a constant fight to persuade the public their members aren’t unshakably sexist, old and racist.This year, the eggshells are too thickly strewn across the red carpet to miss. No wonder those goodie bags are rammed with cannabis: make one off-colour comment and your career is toast. So heightened is the anxiety that the Academy opted not to replace Kevin Hart as host, perhaps figuring a rest is safer than a change.For a film, as well as a figure, to survive current conditions, a social message is compulsory. A Star is Born was considered a shoo-in for best picture six months ago. Now it has no chance, for it cannot be tethered to a political bandwagon. It’s an insular story about the fabulousness of showbiz – a subject that would, until recently, have been catnip to the Academy, but is insufficient today. You need confidence to celebrate yourself so explicitly, and the Oscars are a gibbering mess. The film that will win, Roma, acquits Oscar voters on artistic grounds: foreign-language, black and white, long and resolutely unsexy. It is just political enough: set in a country under attack by Trump, sympathetic to a class and ethnicity of domestic workers to whom white Californian artistic types could feel especially indebted. That it is also the best film on the list is coincidental.With or without the ministrations of Dr Gauthier, Hollywood will survive Sundaynight. The dust will settle and the trauma will fade. And if not, that goodie bag also includes therapy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dfb3b5b46e3e532e3a8476ffa24c5c71cd82cc9/0_1019_6839_4105/master/6839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5efb73755a9a31287a406499d179c6a7","title":"phoebe waller bridge fleabag","story":"Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s series moves to BBC One ... and there’s no invite to binge onlineIt is included in the formal contract of every writer here that they must watch Fleabag and discuss how much they love both it and Phoebe Waller-Bridge on a regular basis, otherwise we are denied our annual bonus of discount Birkenstocks.Happily, Fleabag is returning for a second season on 4 March, which at least gives us something to go on.The comedy wrapped its story up so neatly in its first season, back in 2016, that some trepidation about its return is only natural.However, the new series trailer, released last week, suggests that such feelings may be misguided: there is lusting after a priest eye-wateringly candid counselling and the promise of a hot misogynist. Fleabag is back, baby!This time, though, it will air on BBC One, rather than online-only on BBC Three as it did in its initial incarnation, and it will be shown in weekly instalments. Actually, it was released weekly in 2016, too, but these days it feels almost quaint to make people wait seven days to see what’s going to happen next.Killing Eve, which similarly harnessed Waller-Bridge’s brilliance as writer and showrunner, was on television on Saturdays, but was also left online in one big juicy boxset on which one could gorge oneself instantly, should the appetite demand it.It is becoming more and more common for shows to be released all at once. Pure, Channel 4’s very good comedy drama, is still on, but I finished it in a week, because all six episodes were put online on the day it debuted. The series is not dissimilar to Fleabag, at least tonally, and its episodes are short, which made it a manageable binge. But once I had finished, I started to feel a slight sense that I had overdone it, that perhaps it would have revealed its charms more plainly had it been meted out by the week. Besides, I was sad that it was over so quickly. I see it in the television listings now and think, wistfully, about what could have been.There is so much good television that it is simply impossible to get through even a snippet of it, which means that delayed gratification is starting to become more and more appealing. The frenzy over Bodyguard last summer, in which we all – horror of horrors – seemed to watch the same programme on the same screen at the same time, so that we could talk about it together, showed that a reprieve from the “just-one-more” pressure of boxsets is certainly welcome, and perhaps overdue. Much like the second season of Fleabag.As winter comes to an end and spring pokes its sunny head above the clouds, and green shoots begin to appear once again, and life seems just that little bit less grey, along comes a news story that distracts from all the chaos with simple, flippant and silly joy.Nintendo has announced that the successor to its outgoing US president and chief operating officer, Reggie Fils-Aime, will be its senior vice-president of sales and marketing, Doug Bowser. “And I ask you, with a name like Bowser, who better to hold the keys to the Nintendo castle?” said Fils-Aime, in a farewell message to fans.“Literally anyone not named after one of Nintendo’s most famous baddies!” replied the collective voice of the internet, which was then drowned out by the collective voice of headline writers everywhere, who had a ball with “Bowser takes over”.This all happened once before, when Bowser – the man Bowser, not the spiky-shelled villain Bowser – arrived as VP of sales in 2015. He thanked fans by posing for a picture in front of stuffed Nintendo toys, including Mario and Luigi, who had been slyly tied up in the background. Nominative determinism is rarely as fun as this.Reading the words “property developers” in a news story has a similar effect on me as seeing the name of a long-forgotten celebrity you once loved: you steel yourself, take a deep breath and think, what have they done now?Whether it’s turfing out social housing tenants or segregating affordable housing residents, developers have been a ghoulish spectre in modern cities, driving up rent and property prices even while poverty and homelessness spread on their own doorstep.One of the many gruesome effects of gentrification is that it often suffocates what attracted people to an area in the first place. They buy flats built next a famous music venue, for example, discover famous music venues can be noisy, complain, then the venue is closed down.Three cheers, then, for Pauline Forster, who has been the landlady of the celebrated George Tavern in Stepney, east London, since she bought it in the early 2000s. Last week Forster had a rare “deed of easement” proposal accepted by Tower Hamlets council, which will safeguard the pub from future noise complaints. A Save the George campaign has been running since 2008, when a proposed development led to worries it would lose its status as a music venue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4102ee315eb44d4743cb4c05f9d247e703e8f5dd/0_397_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f1b69af74d8b7f071bb5451a1efc37","title":"early spring share your photographs and stories","story":"We want your help documenting the situation as record temperatures bring early signs of spring across EuropeAfter one of the hottest summers ever in 2018 and a mild winter across much of Europe, record temperatures are suggesting spring is once more beginning earlier than usual.Swallows and house martins have been spotted more than a month earlier than usual and temperatures are up to 20C higher than this time last year.

Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

The reason, simply, is that there is nowhere to hide. Every spoonful is practically identical to the other, so you have to create a certain complexity, a touch of drama, to keep your guests engaged. That’s why I invest time and effort in today’s soups, building flavours and textures from the bottom up, by adding ingredients in increments, as well as acidity, textural contrasts, aromas and spices, to end up with a bowl that’s full of warm, characterful appeal.The magical power of chicken soup is pretty much universally accepted, and this one is no exception, with the deep-flavoured parmesan giving it an extra super-power. You can substitute the pappardelle for any pasta, really.1 whole chicken (around 1.4kg)1 whole head garlic, halved, plus 4 cloves, peeled and crushed1 onion, cut into 4 wedgesSalt and black pepper2 tbsp olive oil2 carrots, peeled and cut into roughly 15mm cubes (220g net weight)3 sticks celery, cut at an angle into roughly 1cm-thick slices (200g net weight)3 bay leaves1½ tbsp thyme leaves, finely chopped60g parmesan, finely grated, plus 1 small piece of rind 5 plum tomatoes, coarsely grated and skins discarded (320g)2 tsp tomato paste180g dried pappardelle nests15g basil leaves, finely shredded1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped Put the chicken, garlic head halves, onion, two litres of water and two and a quarter teaspoons of salt in a large saucepan for which you have a lid. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer, cover and cook for 80 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a board, leave to cool slightly, then pull off the meat in large shreds discard the skin, bones and cartilage. Strain the stock into a medium saucepan (discard the solids): you need 1.7 litres, so save any excess for another use. Keep warm on a low heat while you get on with everything else.Put the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat, then saute the carrot and celery for four minutes, until they start to soften. Add the crushed garlic, bay, thyme and parmesan rind, cook for 30 seconds, then stir in the tomatoes and tomato paste, and cook for three minutes, until the tomatoes cook down slightly. Pour in 1.7 litres of hot stock, half a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper, bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened.Ladle out 400g of the soup, about 5050 liquid to solids (avoid the bay and rind), transfer to a blender and blitz smooth. Stir back into the soup pan and turn up the heat to medium-high. Add the pasta, chicken flesh and a good grind of pepper, and cook for 15 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. Discard the bay leaves and parmesan rind.Divide the soup between four bowls, top with the basil, chilli, a good grind of pepper and a sprinkling of grated parmesan, and serve with extra parmesan alongside.Versions of this soup, in which lemon is king, are found all over the Arab world. Mine is ever-changing, depending on what kind of stock I have in my freezer, or herbs in my fridge, so feel free to play around with the ingredients as you see fit. I like my soup super lemony, but adjust this to your taste, too. If using vegetable stock, consider adding a couple of teaspoons of miso paste to enrich the broth. 200g brown or green lentils110ml olive oil2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped 5 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1½ tbsp cumin seeds3 lemons – finely shave the skin off 1 into 5 wide strips, then juice all 3 to get 75mlSalt and black pepper3 firm, waxy potatoes, such as desiree, peeled and cut into 4cm pieces (650g-700g net weight)400g Swiss or rainbow chard, leaves and stalks separated, then roughly sliced1 litre vegetable stock (or chicken or beef, if you prefer)1½ tbsp coriander leaves, finely chopped2 spring onions, finely sliced on an anglePut the lentils in a medium saucepan, cover with plenty of cold, lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the lentils are nearly cooked but still retain a bite, then drain.While the lentils are cooking, put 80ml oil in a large, heavy-based pot for which you have a lid, and put on a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions, garlic, cumin, lemon skin, two and a quarter teaspoons of salt and plenty of pepper. Cook for about 15 minutes, stirring often, until very soft and golden. Stir in the potatoes, lentils and chard stalks, pour in the stock and 800ml water, bring to a gentle simmer, then cover and leave to cook for 20 minutes, or until the potato is soft but still holds its shape.Turn off the heat, stir in the lemon juice and chard leaves, and leave to cook in the residual heat for two or three minutes, until wilted. Divide between four bowls, drizzle over the remaining two tablespoons of oil, garnish with the coriander and spring onion, and serve hot.This soup draws on both Middle Eastern and Indian techniques, and is everything you’d want from a bowl: it is smoky from the burnt aubergine, earthy from the greens and spicy from the tempered oil.

Randomly poke the aubergines all over a few times with the tip of a small, sharp knife. Once the pan is smoking hot, lay in the aubergines and cook, turning occasionally, until deeply charred on the outside and softened inside – about 50 minutes. Don’t worry about over-charring them: the longer they cook, the better. Transfer the aubergines to a colander set over a bowl and leave to drain for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the blackened skin and stems, then tear the flesh into long strips. In a medium bowl, mix the aubergine flesh with a tablespoon of lemon juice, a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Set aside until needed.While the aubergines are grilling, start on the soup. Heat four tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and deeply browned – about 12 minutes. Add the garlic, cook for 30 seconds more, until fragrant, then turn the heat to medium-low and add the chopped herbs, spring onions and three tablespoons of water. Leave to cook, stirring often so the herbs don’t catch, for about 15 minutes, until deeply green and fragrant. Turn up the heat to medium-high, add the cinnamon, cumin and a teaspoon of turmeric, cook for 30 seconds, then stir in the spinach, stock, 400ml water, a teaspoon and three-quarters of salt and a generous grind of black pepper.

Stir the blitzed soup back into the pan, add the remaining two tablespoons of lemon juice, and keep warm.For the tempered oil, put the chilli and remaining three tablespoons of oil in a small frying pan and turn the heat to medium. Leave to cook, stirring occasionally, until the chilli is translucent and glossy – 10-12 minutes. Add the mustard seeds, cook for a minute, stir in the final eighth of a teaspoon of turmeric, then immediately tip the mixture into a bowl to stop it cooking further. To serve, ide the soup between four bowls. Stir the picked herbs into the aubergines, spoon on top of the soup, and finish with a drizzle of the tempered oil and spices."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fb60a88b2bb1c411c3b0d25706744f9cc36e880/0_81_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7e20f5000a96296b8d3076f5a86ab39","title":"burnley tottenham premier league match report","story":"Perhaps Mauricio Pochettino should have been wary about describing this game as a cup final for his players. Everybody knows Tottenham rarely last long in the cups and defeat by a more determined Burnley should now bring an end to talk of the title run-in turning into a three-horse race.The game was a bit of a slow-burner, which might have had something to do with the early kick-off but in Tottenham’s case was more likely to have been because of the team bus arriving with only an hour to spare after being delayed in traffic. The visitors spent the first quarter playing themselves into the game at a leisurely pace with Burnley content to let them, though by half-time Tottenham had stepped up their efforts and produced a few half chances. A single speculative shot from Kane was all Spurs managed in the opening half-hour, though it took a good block by Ben Mee to prevent the returning striker putting his side in front when Son Heung-min sent a shot across the face of goal.Christian Eriksen saw a shot saved then lofted a perfectly weighted pass to pick out Kane’s run into the area, only for the England forward to show too much of the ball to Tom Heaton. It was not all Spurs – Barnes possibly came closest to a first-half goal with a shot that fizzed narrowly over after Jeff Hendrick had got the better of Jan Vertonghen near the right corner flag – yet Burnley ended the half playing on the edge of their own penalty area. They consistently put enough men behind the ball to frustrate the best efforts of Son, Eriksen and Moussa Sissoko to find a way through, though inviting Spurs to come at them seemed a dangerous game.It still felt that way when Kane opened the second half with one of those languid though deceptively well-struck right-foot curlers from 25 yards that Heaton did well to keep out, yet just before the hour and totally against the run of play Burnley took the lead with a set piece. Dwight McNeil deserved credit for a well flighted corner that allowed Chris Wood to score with his head from the six-yard line, though as the young winger’s stunning turn in the middle of the pitch helped win the corner in the first place he played a considerable part in breaking the deadlock.Spurs complained that the ball had gone out for the corner off a Burnley player but it was up to them to respond and they did so nine minutes later, when Danny Rose pinched a few yards at a throw-in to give Kane a start on the Burnley defence, allowing the striker to cut into the area from the left and slide a low shot into Heaton’s far corner.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsThe contest was open and entertaining now, with Juan Foyth and Phil Bardsley both picking up cautions for over-enthusiastic challenges and Hendrick almost restoring Burnley’s lead with a shot that rolled narrowly wide. McNeil saw a shot stopped on the line by Hugo Lloris before increased Burnley pressure finally paid off seven minutes from the end, when the substitute Jóhann Berg Gudmundsson’s hopeful cross-cum-shot reach Barnes at the far post for an easy tap-in.Spurs still have not drawn a game this season and they could have no complaints about returning home empty-handed from this one. Eriksen had a chance to snatch an equaliser right at the death but he directed his close-range header straight at Heaton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1d66c23decdc4473a569737c7ae514e4ef088b7/45_319_4823_2894/master/4823.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21196fde7c82084da74e1c6bea5eb613","title":"arsenal v manchester city continental cup final live","story":"After a hard-fought 0-0 draw at Bramall Lane, City lifted the Continental Cup thanks to two superb saves from Karen Bardsley in the penalty shootoutThe inspirational Steph Houghton lifts the Continental Cup as Hey Jude blares out through the tannoy.

That wasn’t much of a chance as she was under pressy from Quinn.101 min: Another great save from Van Veenendaal! Parris picked up a loose ball 25 yards from goal and scorched thrillingly away from Quinn. That took her into the area, where she stabbed a low shot that was superbly smothered by the outrushing Van Veendendaal.100 min It’s going to penalties, isn’t it.97 min Weir’s low cross from the left flashes right across the face of goal. She has been quiet superb today.95 min Miedema and Scott collided at the end of that attack, when Scott attempted to block Miedema’s cross, and both are limping heavily.94 min A long, winding run from Miedema takes her into the area, but her low cross is blocked by Beattie.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels91 min Peep peep! Arsenal get extra time under way.Peep peep! It’s going to extra time.90+3 min: Beckie hits the bar for City! That was a brilliant effort, a rising drive from a very tight angle on the left side of the box. It beat Van Veenendaal at the near post and clattered off the bar. On reflection, I think Van Veendendaal waved that past, thinking it was going into the side netting.90+1 min A sudden explosion from Miedema. She combines with Van de Donk on the edge of the area, waits for the ball to sit down and smacks an excellent shot just wide. I’m not sure Bardsley had that covered.90 min We’re three minutes away from extra time.89 min At the other end, Scott hits a swirling long-range shot that is beaten away for a corner by Van Veenendaal. A camera save.88 min Mead almost wins it for Arsenal! That was a lovely attack, their best of the half. Miedema, on the halfway line, flicked the ball classily round the corner to Bloodworth, who swept an angled pass from right to left to find Mead. She was one against one with the last defender Houghton, and moved into the area before making just enough space to drill a low shot that was well held at the near post by Bardsley.87 min City have been much the better team in the second half. Arsenal will not give a solitary fig should they find a way to win this game.85 min With both teams tiring, the game is very open. Arsenal have a half chance at the other end when Mead’s snapshot is blocked by Walsh.83 min: What a save from Van Veenendaal! Beckie played a square pass from the left to Weir, who took it beautifully on the run and surged into the area. Then she drilled a fierce left-footed shot that hit the chest of the outrushing keeper and flashed just wide of the far post. A goalkick was given, but that was definitely a save from Van Veenendaal.83 min Weir’s vicious corner from the left is patted down by Van Veenendaal to Houghton, who takes the ball down and splatters a half-volley into orbit from 12 yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089d7f1f253d0426fad99df2f0ea41d2d9205d84/0_22_1312_787/master/1312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e448c51769fd315281629c8c38faab85","title":"burnley v spurs premier league live","story":"Harry Kane returned, but couldn’t stop Spurs from sliding to a defeat that puts a dent in their title challenge.And that’s your lot. Paul Wilson was our man at Turf Moor. Here’s his take. Thanks for reading!And we haven’t forgotten about Sean Dyche! “The relentless nature, the will and determination, has come back to us. We’re asking more questions of the opposition. The number of times we put their back four under pressure! They’re a top side, we’re not making any bold claims. But the best thing of all was our calmness when it went 1-1. The first goal, if it’s a corner or not, is a tough one to call, a ricochet. My gripe about theirs is, not only does it go out this side of the halfway line, it then gets thrown in eight yards the other side, and also the fourth official grabbed the ball and gave it back to them, so he plays it quickly. And that leads to a goal. That’s the gripe. That’s really frustrating. A massive moment, and that went against us. Other than that, I though the officials had a good game.”A contrite Pochettinho in the press conference: “You know how important the game was. Of course when you feel so disappointed and upset you make mistakes ... I made a mistake and needed to go to the dressing room and get some water and relax ... what happened happened.”Mauricio Pochettino, calm and frank, gives his verdict. “What happened on the pitch happened. We made a few mistakes. Burnley fight a lot and we don’t deserve the defeat, but that is football. It was an important game, we needed the three points to fight for the Premier League. It is not normally how I behave. It is difficult for us to be a contender now. There are a lot of games to play but in my mind we needed the three points to put pressure on. We cannot blame anyone other than ourselves, because we were unable to win. Everyone on the touchline complained, they complained, we complained, we try to back our players. We need to improve for the next time. I am going to accept everything from the FA, but I hope nothing will go further.”But here’s something worth pointing out: Spurs didn’t fold this afternoon, they were just beaten by a fine side at the top of their game. Burnley were very determined, very tough ... and very, very good. They played an excellent match, and look a proper side again, after a rocky start to the campaign. Their goalscoring heroes Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood - both relentless - are interviewed by Sky, and they’re extremely pleased with a precious three points. Barnes admits to targeting Foyth “a little bit”, while Wood report that confidence at Turf Moor is high at the moment. “We have to make it difficult for these big teams,” says Barnes, “and we did that. We’ve shown how good we are.”By all accounts, the row between Pochettino and Dean spilled down the tunnel. Shades of the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 2016! Something may or may not have been said after Pochettino complained to Dean at the final whistle, hence his willingness to return and engage in further debate. A repeated enquiry of “what did you say?” answered every time by “go away”. No doubt we’ll hear more of this, grapple fans. No doubt at all!Mauricio Pochettino loses his rag completely! He gets right up in Mike Dean’s grille, demanding explanation for something or other. The corner that led to the opening goal? If it’s just that, this reaction is well out of proportion, given Spurs got the benefit of a generous decision for their equaliser, too. So it’ll be interesting to hear what that was all about. Pochettino came back for seconds, too, invading the referee’s personal space in the chest-out, no-nonsense style. Many pints of steam are pouring out of his lugs! I wish I could read lips. Dean said “go away” quite a lot, that I do know. Chances are we haven’t heard the last of this. A magnificent pantomime rumble, highly entertaining, although depending on your stance on these things, the usual think-of-the-children caveat applies.Burnley claim three precious points! They were marvellous today, and surely won’t be going down. Tottenham’s title bid meanwhile takes a serious hit.90 min +3: It really hasn’t been Tottenham’s day. A cross from the left. Lamela rises, six yards out. He surely has to score and salvage a point for the title hopefuls. But he sends a lame header straight at Heaton.90 min +2: Wood takes the ball to the corner flag on the left. Tick, tock. By the dugouts, Pochettinho crosses his arms tightly and tucks his hands into his armpits. More frustration.90 min: Kane crosses from the left. It’s half cleared and drops to Eriksen, who sends a tame shot over the crossbar. There will be four added minutes.89 min: Now the hosts win a corner. Steam pours from Sissoko’s ears as he tussles with Brady, who is just pushing his buttons because he can. All the while, time continues to run out for Tottenham.88 min: Brady wins a throw out on the left, deep in Spurs territory. Before it can be taken, Lucas Moura comes on for Son, who has been uncharacteristically quiet today. Burnley then take the throw, and hold the ball up in the corner awhile, before winning another. Rinse and repeat. Spurs are getting visibly frustrated.86 min: Llorente commits a common-or-garden foul on the edge of the Burnley box. free kick. Lamela doesn’t agree with the decision, and engages the referee in vigorous philosophical debate. He goes in the book.85 min: Unless Spurs can magic up a dramatic turnaround, they’ll be five points behind leaders Manchester City and second-placed Liverpool, the latter still with tomorrow’s match at Manchester United in hand. This explains why Pochettino is slumped back in his seat, with a face on. He’s fuming.Brady overcooks a cross from the left. Goal kick. But then Aurier faffs about while dribbling upfield, allowing Gudmundsson to drive into the box from the left. He shoots ... he scuffs ... but the ball dribbles diagonally towards Barnes, at the far post. He’s six yards out, and can’t miss!82 min: A free kick for Burnley out on the right, Gudmundsson purchasing a cheap one off Rose. It’s launched long, and Aurier is forced to head out for a corner on the left. When it’s taken, Rose shanks a clearance backwards and out of play for a second corner. From which ...80 min: Burnley make a double change, replacing Hendrick and McNeil on the flanks with Gudmundsson and Brady.79 min: Rose dribbles down the left, and hooks into the mixer. Llorente fancies it, but Heaton wants it more. A fine claim under pressure.77 min: Spurs pile forward, then are caught short at the back, Wood romping into acres on the right. His low cross is met by McNeil, coming in from the other flank. He shoots low and hard Lloris parries well. Spurs hack out for a corner, which comes to nothing. This is set up perfectly now. The last few minutes of this match promise much in the way of weird and wonderful entertainment!76 min: This is manic, end-to-end fare now. Aurier dribbles around near the byline to the right of the Burnley goal, and takes two attempts at a cross. Neither is any good. Spurs then make their second change, replacing Foyth with Lamela. They’re going for this now!75 min: A cute turn down the inside-right channel by Hendrick, and Burnley are away. Barnes is teed up to the right of the D. His low shot is blocked out for a corner. From the set piece, hit long from the right, Tarkowski rises highest at the far post, and attempts to guide a header into the top right. There’s not enough juice on it, and Lloris claims the looping effort easily.74 min: Aurier crosses from deep it’s blocked by Taylor, and that’s a corner for Spurs. Eriksen works it to Aurier, who drives it into a crowded box from the right. Burnley somehow get it clear.72 min: Re-read the entry for 69 min, replacing Foyth for Bardsley and Wood for Rose. It’s uncanny. Bardsley is now another player fortunate to escape with just a yellow, and Dean remains stuck on 99.70 min: Hendrick blasts a witless free kick into the Spurs wall. But the hosts are soon coming back at Spurs, Wood flicking a pass right for Hendrick, who whips a shot across the face of goal and inches wide of the bottom left.69 min: Foyth is booked for a late slide on Wood. That could have been Mike Dean’s 100th red, because the young Spurs defender was flying through the air, studs showing. But it’s just yellow, and Dean’s still on 99. The fact there wasn’t much contact, and Foyth looked to be pulling out of the challenge at the last, might have influenced that decision.67 min: Now it’s Sean Dyche’s turn to lose the plot on the touchline, sure that Rose had nicked a few yards at the throw. Both teams might have got away with one.Spurs are back in it! And a little controversy about this one, too, as Rose steals a couple of yards at a quick throw-in on the left, in order to set Kane scampering free! He’s got the beating of Mee, holding his man off as he enters the box. Kane draws Heaton and slips a cute finish across the keeper and into the bottom right! He’s back, baby. Oh he’s back.64 min: A corner for Spurs on the left. Rose is teed up, to the left of the D his shot is blocked and deflects out for another corner. The second set piece is slammed upfield by Bardsley. Llorente’s first act of the afternoon is to slam into Mee, while contesting a high ball, and he’s immediately in the book.62 min: Spurs have to throw the kitchen sink at this. Pochettino withdraws Winks and sends on Llorente.61 min: So the replay of the award of that corner will be shown more than once, I’ll be bound. Especially if Spurs can’t turn this around. Kind of a shame that it’ll eclipse another replay, shown just before the goal: a nice moment between Kane and Heaton, the striker congratulating the keeper on his save on 50 minutes, the keeper warmly slapping the striker on the back in awe of his fine shot. All in the heat of battle.59 min: That’s Wood’s seventh goal in his last ten games. Will it scupper Tottenham’s title challenge? The visitors had been much the better side in the opening exchanges of the second half, but now look! On the touchline, Pochettino is beyond livid, claiming that the corner should never have been awarded. Hendrick had gone sliding in with Vertonghen, and he’s insistent the ball came off the Burnley man last. The officials didn’t agree.Westwood whips the corner in from the right. Wood rises highest, six yards out, and plants a header flush in the top-left corner! The ball comes down off the bar and over the line, Lloris with no chance!56 min: Mee romps down the left and crosses into the Spurs area. McNeil tries to bring it down to shoot, but there’s not enough time for that. The ball breaks to Hendrick on the right, and he earns a corner. From which ...54 min: Kane scampers after a long blootered clearance. Heaton bravely comes out of his area to head clear before the striker can start causing trouble.53 min: Spurs keep probing. Foyth bursts down the right channel and is knocked over by Mee. A free kick, just to the right of centre, 25 yards out. Eriksen floats it diagonally towards Foyth, who heads harmlessly over from the middle of a thicket.51 min: Spurs take the corner and ping it around awhile. Aurier tries to cross from the right, but the ball clanks into Taylor. He wants a penalty for handball, but he’s not getting it.50 min: Space for Kane to wander into, down the inside-right channel. Nobody closes him down, though he’s got no options. No matter! From 30 yards, he sends a rising swerver towards the top left, a wondrous heatseeker! Heaton, at full stretch, tips spectacularly round the post. What a shot, and a save to match!48 min: Son crosses from the left and the ball is slammed into the stand behind the Burnley goal by Tarkowski. No nonsense. The set piece is played short, Son eventually pulling one back to tee up Rose, who is steaming in. He shoots, but Cork is right up in his grille to block.46 min: A positive start to the half from Spurs, as Rose turns Hendrick inside out, like an old sock. His twinkletoes make it to the byline, but his cutback isn’t so good and Burnley clear. A clear sign that Spurs want these three points! In the context of the title race, they really need them.We’re off again! Spurs get the second half underway. No changes. “Never mind who Mike Dean shows his 100th red card to what for is the question,” argues Ian Sargeant. “Is he waiting for something cast iron - a headbutt, a two-footed lunge or a clear professional foul perhaps? Or something utterly pedantic, like a second yellow for re-entering the field of play without permission?” Yes, you make a good point here. Ideally, the red card will be thoroughly pedantic, presented with a ludicrous theatrical flourish, and later proved to be preposterously incorrect. That would be nice, wouldn’t it. Good old Mike Dean.Half-time entertainment. Some magical memories of matches between these two famous names of English football, courtesy of Burnley regular Iain Noble. Enjoy!“There were some cracking matches between these two teams in the late 50s and early 60s, many of which I was lucky enough to see. The Clarets were desperately unlucky in the 61-62 season. I saw just about every home game they played (I was 12) and they were just irresistible for the first half of the season, wonderful football from probably their greatest-ever side. “But there were a lot of cancellations because of a particularly hard winter and, along with their FA Cup run (several replays), the fixtures and injuries piled up and up. With the small squads of those days, they were gradually worn down and couldn’t seem to do anything else but draw. Even then they could have got back against Spurs in the FA Cup final but for a very debatable penalty late on.“The next season for the third round of the Cup they were drawn away at Spurs. They won 3-0. But the match I remember best at Turf Moor - apart from my first in April ’61 which was their win 4-2 against Spurs after being 2-0 down at half time, a score that even the official Spurs history says was ‘very much against the run of play’ - was in April 1964. We stuffed Spurs 7-2. Oh my, Pointer and my McIlroy long ago!”Title-chasing Spurs go in at the break slightly frustrated. They’ve been the better side, just, but haven’t seriously worked Heaton. Can they up it in the second half, and move to within two points of Manchester City and Liverpool? Stay with us to find out!43 min: Barnes comes off second best in a challenge with Eriksen and wins a free kick for his trouble, out on the right. Westwood sends it into the Spurs box, and there’s a brief game of head tennis, but nothing that seriously troubles the visitors. Lloris hasn’t had a great deal to do.41 min: Spurs are beginning to hog the ball. Nothing’s quite coming off for them, though. Rose bustles his way down the left, and nearly breaks clear, but Hendrick is a study in determination and eventually forces the Spurs man to run the ball out of play.39 min: Spurs are beginning to ask questions, though. Now Rose skedaddles down the left and crosses deep for Aurier, who sends a weak header straight at Heaton. One the keeper can throw his cap on.38 min: Spurs pass and probe, probe and pass. Aurier then lifts a cross in from the right, finding Kane on the penalty spot. It’d take some header from there, and he does his best, but the effort floats harmlessly into the arms of Heaton.37 min: McNeil strips Aurier out on the left. For a second, it looks as though he’s going to tear clear, but doesn’t trust himself in a footrace with Foyth, and overhits a cross towards Wood on the other wing. The danger’s over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b6fd5462d4551bdf484f93f758864d84a2be01/0_3169_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffe87d92ffceaa51f42c72e8585fd9cc","title":"yann demange perpetual outsider identity finding my tribe","story":"Filmmaker was born to French-Algerian parents and made his home, and his name, in multicultural London. But he never felt a sense of belonging. Then Hollywood called … Where are you from? It’s a question I’ve always had a hard time with. And since moving to the US four years ago, I’m asked it on a regular basis. Maybe it’s the combination of a brownish face, London accent and French names that throws people off. Who knows? But this question, hearing it asked over and over these past few years, has forced me to confront unresolved questions I have about identity: how I grew up and how those experiences led me to being a director.People tend to like things compartmentalised and simple, but it’s never been that simple for me. I’ve never had any sense of a “national identity” or, for that matter, a sense of belonging to any one tribe. I’m mixed race: French white mother, Algerian father. So “I’m a Londoner” is my standard go-to short response when the question comes up. That’s the simplest answer I feel comfortable giving without getting into it.“Ah, so you’re British…” is the reaction I often get in the US. I always bristle a little at that one. “No, I’m a Londoner.”It’s complicated, so let’s stick to the short answer, bruv. I’ve never been able to identify as British, not when I was called “Paki” by Brits for most of my childhood. I feel similarly about being French. I’m a French passport holder, I’m legally French, but I haven’t lived in France since the age of two. I can’t call myself Algerian either. I grew up largely estranged from my father and, although I studied Arabic at one stage in my teens, I don’t speak it, which pains me.Add to the mix that my mother was raised Catholic, but isn’t religious, and my father is Muslim. Yet neither “gave” me a religion to follow, or wanted to dictate a cultural identity for me. My parents left me to figure out my identity. Neither claimed me for their tribe. So at a very early age, one thing became clear: I’d always be an outsider.Eventually I came to realise I’d always be a Londoner, too. Being a Londoner is something I could always accept and own. It transcends national connotations. It’s a vibe, attitude, swag, banter. It doesn’t have a flag or passport or past atrocities attached to it in the same way. But I’m also a particular type of Londoner, one of the multicultural mongrels who came of age in the 1990s and found expression in the rise of the jungle, drum and bass, and then the UK garage music scenes. A common language emerged across races that bound working-class Londoners living within the “melting pots”, as opposed to those posh Londoners who lived in close proximity to us, but didn’t experience ersity beyond sharing a postcode.But the question “Where are you from?” goes to the heart of an identity issue I have found myself forced to face all over again, when I was somewhere I felt more out of place than ever: in a white, privileged, Hollywood bubble.Slowly, as the dust settled and the political rhetoric of the ongoing election debates was kicking in, I started to feel a strange loneliness and discomfort. I’d gone from living in a particular part of London that was a genuine melting pot of ersity, coming from a family of multiple ethnicities, to living in the most segregated society I had ever experienced. And – get this – I was bunched in with the whites for the first time in my life. Me? One of the privileged whites?Don’t get me wrong: London is no mecca of equality. We may have ersity among the working-class communities, but that’s not to be confused with opportunities within my own industry. Along with many of my – shall we say “ethnically erse” – peers from the UK, I had to migrate to the US in order to have a real chance at a career with some scale. Diversity in the industry is surface-level back home, as are the stories told in film and on TV.In LA, there were opportunities for me. But who was going to be my tribe? Where could I fit in?In looking for an answer, I had to think back to my multicultural family. I was born in Paris in 1977, and two years later I was an immigrant. My family moved to south London, then west. My mother is light, can’t go in the sun, whiter than white. My father was born and raised in Algiers, grew up during the war for independence from France, and moved to Paris at 18. I have two older brothers, each with a different father – one is Afro-Caribbean the other is Argentinian and half-indigenous.My mother and father broke up soon after they came to London, and I was fostered from the age of four to 12 while my mum found her feet as a single mother and immigrant. I had two four-year stints with different families in Essex. The first was with a French-speaking household, and the second was with a white Cockney family. I have never quite shaken the accent that gave me.The families who took me in were decent people. But they weren’t my family, and they certainly weren’t my tribe. I wasn’t well received in Essex. I remember trying to reason with some white Cockney kids calling me “Paki” at school once. “I’m North African. I ain’t Pakistani.” Blank looks. “You’re still a fucking Paki.” That summed it up. “Paki” was how they saw anything “other”, between their understanding of complete whiteness and what they could clearly discern as blackness.My eldest brother, Eric, who is 17 years older than me, was my hero growing up. Once my father was gone, my brother filled that role. He was anxious to help me avoid the painful experiences of racism he’d had growing up in France and was still experiencing as a young black man in London. He was there during the Brixton riots, and had his fair share of battles with racists.I remember how confident he was when he came back from a stint living in New York in the late 80s. It was an important, empowering trip for him. He had discovered his blackness. He was wearing Spike Lee merchandise, reading African American literature, had started playing basketball and was wearing caps, which, believe it or not, was fucking radical in London at the time. His year in New York had given him an attitude and confidence that I loved he’d found a personal way of owning and being proud of his blackness. It was unapologetic – and I wanted in.This was round about the time that Tim Burton’s Batman came out, which was the same year Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing was released, the latter being the cultural phenomenon of the year and a bit of a game-changer. My brother came home wearing a T-shirt with the Batman logo, except it said “Blackman”. I remember thinking that was the coolest thing in the world. I wanted one! It was awkward for my brother, but he had to explain why I couldn’t wear that. He was black. I wasn’t.“I know, but we’re family, right?”“Nah, cultural and ethnic identity don’t work that way, bro.”All this confusion even extended to my name. My given first name is Mounir, but my brother convinced my mother to change it to Yann. He had experienced so much racism as a young black man in France, and he told my mother I would have the same fate as an Algerian. So Mounir became my middle name once my father left, and I was too young to have a say.I wonder if on some level he was right. Would Mounir Hanine have been a filmmaker, too? Perhaps Mounir Demange would have had a clearer sense of tribe. Perhaps he would have been “claimed” or embraced by the North African community more? Who knows?Through all this, I really wanted my own culturally empowering moment, like my eldest brother had experienced in New York it felt like the missing piece I needed. So in the summer of 1991 I went to Algeria. I remember the feeling when I first got there, of looking around and seeing that the majority of people looked like me. It was undeniable that I was from this tribe, genetically speaking at least. But I couldn’t speak Arabic and, though I was making an effort to live as a Muslim at the time, I didn’t know how to truly be one. I was still an outsider.It was on this trip that I first saw The Battle of Algiers, when my cousins screened it for me. My family was incredibly proud of the film, as are many Algerians, but they were particularly proud and obsessed with the film because my aunt starred in it. She played the beautiful woman who plants the bomb in the milk bar. This was the only time she ever acted in anything.The director, Pontecorvo, used a lot of non-actors, something I would later do myself. I loved the fact he used real people and channelled who they were and what they could bring. Not only does this give the people you are depicting some ownership over their story, but the sense of authenticity and the experiences they bring to the process can help a film to feel truly immersive, rather than a story “told”, I think.So I had “returned” to the family, and I would now come every school holiday and get to know them all properly and perhaps start to have a sense of tribe. Or so I thought.It was 1991, and in the background a political conflict was brewing. The FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) had won the local elections, so the government cancelled the national elections. After I returned to London an all-out civil war broke out. More than 250,000 people died over the proceeding decade. Every time a school holiday came around, it was too dangerous for me to risk going back to see my family. I never saw them again. I have not been back to Algeria since that original trip.Knowing my aunt had been in The Battle of Algiers strengthened my love for film. As absurd as it sounds, on some level I think I felt like I had discovered an inheritance to some sort of personal lineage in movies. It gave me a kind of connection and claim to film. I may just be projecting this on to it now, of course – the human need to try to make sense of, and find meaning in, narratives being so strong.I never thought of film as a possible career path the notion would have been absurd to me at the time. It was simply my medicine, my comfort and escape. Film showed me there were so many people living many different lives, and they were all really complicated. I found comfort in that.My first American movie, White Boy Rick, was released in December, and is based on a true story. A father-son story set in Detroit in the mid-80s during the crack epidemic, it’s about a 14-year-old named Rick, the only white kid left in the east side of Detroit after “white flight”, who becomes completely immersed in the African American community. He’s an outsider, an “inside outsider”, like so many of my protagonists have been.I arrived in the US to make the film at a strange time. Trump was gearing up to run for president, and a Brexit movement was brewing back home. We know how that all turned out. The landscape has changed. People seem increasingly reluctant to engage with the “other” right now, and there is a global shift towards nationalism. Everyone is tribing up again and calling each other out. Lines are being drawn in the sand.I guess my tribe is the tribeless. I have come to terms with the fact that I will remain a perpetual outsider. But now I know who I am. I am an outsider. Yes, I’m still seeking. Yes, it’s still confusing, but what I do as a filmmaker is embrace that question mark. I know first-hand the importance of telling the stories of people who are under-represented, particularly during a time when the discourse is becoming increasingly black and white. So I’ll continue to explore outsiders in storytelling, in the hope that it may some day unlock something for me, or lead to some sort of inner peace. And I’ll continue giving my short answer to the question “Where are you from?” Because as you can see, the alternative answer can go on for-fucking-ever, innit.

At school, I could make anything from scraps and, in 2014, an old teacher contacted me with details of a competition running on a bridal blog. Participants were asked to design a wedding dress out of toilet paper. I procrastinated for a long time until, three days before deadline, I decided to go for it.You could use any number of toilet rolls, plus tape, glue or thread. The top 10 designs would be modelled at the finals in New York, and the ultimate winner would get a $10,000 prize.I spent $100 on toilet paper and didn’t sleep for two days. My design was an elaborately constructed off-the-shoulder dress, with fringing and a train of paper roses. It earned me a place in the finals and, while I didn’t win the cash prize, there was a lady from the toilet paper industry on the judging panel who sprang from her seat, applauded wildly and declared my dress worthy of a lifetime supply. It was kind of shocking and unexpected, but everyone laughed and cheered: it was a celebration of my dress. It wasn’t the most glamorous prize but it was at least practical.The toilet rolls started arriving three months later. I was at design school in Orange County and living in a rented room, so my housemates were pretty excited when I got a phone call from UPS saying there was a big order for me to pick up. I pulled up at the depot in my Mini Cooper expecting a large package, and was met by two pallets, piled high with about 20 boxes, containing hundreds of rolls. I couldn’t get it all in the car. I folded the seats down, opened up boxes and shoved packets in every footwell. I was sweating. It was like something out of a movie.This would happen every two or three months I would receive up to 400 rolls at a time. I’d go to the warehouse, or a haulage truck would pull up outside my house.Storing it was a problem. I made a bedside table out of it, put it under my desk, in my wardrobe and in the garage. Christmas 2014 was the cheapest ever everyone got toilet roll. At work, I wrapped up an 18-roll pack for our white-elephant game – a bit like secret Santa – and everyone fought over it. I gave them out for family birthdays because they were coming so thick and fast, but they sent a mix of qualities and I always kept the more expensive mega rolls, which were softer and more luxurious, for myself. When I moved across state, I had to rent a trailer to take the toilet rolls with me.After about three years, when the deliveries abruptly stopped, I was pretty shocked. I had failed to figure out that my entire lifetime supply had been sent up front – that was why I had received so much, so often. The company had calculated how many rolls a man my age, living alone, would need for life and delivered them all. I wished then that I hadn’t been so generous, and became more reserved about giving them away. My supply eventually ran out in early 2017: I had blown it in a couple of years.I’m still known as “the toilet paper guy”. It’s a never-ending joke with my friends and I still get stopped by strangers at the mall. A few weeks ago, it happened at a local restaurant.I chuckle inside every time I have to buy toilet paper at the supermarket but it hurts a bit, too. Sometimes I take a picture at the checkout and send it to friends.‘I thought I’d be eating KFC every day, but I get one bonus bucket a month.’ Lewis Austin, 22, double-glazing salesman, BridgendWhen I was 18, I used to watch the YouTuber KSI and at the end of one of his videos he advertised a competition to win 50 years’ worth of free KFC, to celebrate its 50th birthday. I used to eat there fairly often – not because I loved it, more because I couldn’t be bothered to cook. So I thought, “Why not?”You had to tell Twitter what you would do to win the prize, and there were all sorts of ridiculous suggestions. It was free to enter, so I had a few goes. The first thing that came into my head was: “I’d eat the hottest chilli in the world.” I put it up there with the hashtag and forgot about it.About three months I was woken by a call from an unknown number at 9am. It was a guy from KFC telling me I’d submitted one of its favourite answers and won. He asked me to go to a branch in Bracknell to film a promotional video with the other winners a few days later. I never thought I’d be on YouTube, but the video is still up there. You can see me eating my ghost chilli. I went for it in one go at first I didn’t think it was so bad but I quickly started sweating. They gave me a frozen drink to cool me down. There was a guy who bungee jumped, another who was rugby tackled and a woman who got married in the restaurant there were flowers out and everything. I absolutely loved life that day. I had all these cameras in my face. I felt like I was a big deal, and all my mates were talking about it.I signed my winner’s contract but, if I’m honest, I didn’t read it, so when the prize started to arrive it wasn’t exactly what I had imagined. I thought I’d be eating KFC every day if I wanted, but each year I get a golden chequebook with 12 “cheques” – one for each month, entitling me to a KFC bonus bucket or a 12-piece sharing bucket.When the first one arrived, in 2015, I headed to a local branch to try it out. They didn’t know what it was and I had to show the manager the video. It took a couple of visits to get that ironed out, but they know me well now.That first year, I blew all the cheques in a few months. I’d go with friends and share a big bucket on a Sunday, after a night out. The meals I’m given with my cheques are too much for one person. It was great for a while, but now the excitement’s worn off. Occasionally someone at work asks if we can get chicken, but sometimes I don’t even get round to claiming my buckets. If I fancy a quick lunch on my own, I just end up paying £6 like everyone else.My mates have always called me chicken, because I run like a chicken, so that’s got another meaning now. My win might not have been what I thought, but I’ve still got buckets full of fried chicken to enjoy till I’m almost 70.‘We have a fridge in the garage for my milk, and Dad’s beers.’ Brady Carpenter, 10, schoolboy, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USMy family are big University of Michigan football fans and I go to the games with my mom and dad, and sometimes my little brother, JJ, too. When I was six, my dad signed me up for their Kids Go Blue fan club, which has a whole bunch of activities. One of them was a press conference with the coach, Jim Harbaugh, and all the kids who were chosen had to think of a question. Mine was: “How much milk do I have to drink to be big enough to be a quarterback?” I was one of the last kids to ask my question and he said to me: “Can I give you a hug?” After that he told me: “Well, Brady, you have to drink as much as your little belly can hold.”It was on ESPN and lots of news channels, which was super cool. This milk company, called Fairlife, saw it and thought it was really cool, too, and asked my mom and dad if I wanted to go on a tour of its factory.They drove my whole family to their farm, in Indiana, in a limo and we stayed in a hotel. They let us have ice-cream and showed us the milk carts powered by cow poo, which was really funny. Then they gave me a football helmet and said they were going to give me free milk for the rest of my life. I was really, really excited.In the limo, there were coolers full of milk for us to take home till my book of coupons arrived. The first ones had my photo on. When we went to the store to use them, some people recognised me from TV. We tried all the types of milk, but I love whole milk and chocolate best.The coupons are good for a litre, and Dad emails when we need more. We usually grab about 10 bottles at a time and we have a fridge in the garage for my milk, and Dad’s beers. I have milk every day on my breakfast cereal and sometimes I take a small bottle for my lunch, or have a cup before bed.If I could choose anything to have for life, I would choose ice-cream, but I really like milk. My dad told me that it makes you really strong and tall. I want to be a golfer when I grow up, so I will need it for that. I think I’m super lucky. No other kid got to win this and it makes me happy that I get to share it with my family and friends. I’m going to drink milk for ever..‘There’s an irony to winning a lifetime supply of ice-cream at the age of 74.’ Rosemary Yeldham, 76, retired radiographer, Wanborough, WiltshireI don’t remember entering a competition. But I must have unknowingly signed up as a friend of Mackie’s – the Scottish ice-cream brand – because I received an email in the summer of 2016 explaining that doing so had won me 26 litres of ice-cream a year, for the rest of my life. It’s equivalent to a tub a fortnight.I’ve loved ice-cream since I was a child it has always made my eyes brighten. In my childhood, there was no ice-cream at home – we had ice-cream wafer sandwiches once in a blue moon – so seeing a Cornish ice-cream seller was the highlight of our summer holidays. I still head to the best ice-cream seller in town in hot weather.When I learned about my win, I just thought: “How absolutely amazing!” I didn’t believe it, so I phoned up to check, with a series of questions. It was such a delight – I kept telling people what had happened. Within a month, a parcel arrived containing vouchers that were redeemable against a one-litre tub. The vouchers took me to my birthday, 8 January, and I receive 26 more every year on that date, which is a lovely gesture.Mackie’s is not so well-known here in Wiltshire. It is stocked in several local supermarkets, but only vanilla, which is a shame because the honeycomb is wonderful. I’d have to go farther afield for other flavours and you can’t very well travel 200 miles to get ice-cream home.My husband, Martin, and I have ice-cream almost every day after dinner, with fruit that we grow in our garden. I always have two tubs in the freezer. I keep a voucher in my purse, because I never know when I’m going to see it.Before my win, I mostly bought ice-cream when my three grandchildren and six step-grandchildren came to visit. The youngest is 16 now. I send vouchers on to them.I still feel delight at my good fortune. Mackie’s contacts me every winter to check I am at the same address, which makes me smile I think they are probably checking I am still alive. There is an irony to winning a lifetime supply at the age of 74. When I’m 96, I might consider that I don’t need 26 litres of ice-cream a year. If I’ve had enough of it, I shall tell them.‘By the time I die, I will have a library curated especially for me.’ Matt Pollard, 27, IT administrator, LiverpoolMy workmates and I are avid readers and, in 2016, one of them saw a competition on Twitter run by Heywood Hill bookshop in Mayfair, London. It was offering a library of a lifetime – a book a month for life. You had to send an email stating your favourite book, and the three of us threw our names in. None of us won, but when it ran again the following year I gave it another shot.Entrants had to say which object and which book they would take to Mars, so, over the summer, I sent off my entry via its website: a Swiss army knife and The Road by Cormac McCarthy – a book I read once a year, about a father and son in a post-apocalyptic land. I forgot about it entirely until, a couple of months later, I got an email at about 10.30pm as I was heading to bed, saying I’d won. I couldn’t believe it. I read it a couple of times before the news sunk in. I’ve won little competitions before – bits of food – but never anything like this. From a young age, I enjoyed going to the library and picking out books. As an adult, I still do, and I have a Kindle so I buy cheap books on that.I was bowled over by how bespoke my prize turned out to be. I had a phone consultation with one of the shop’s book experts who noted my reading preferences and interests. Each month, they send me a new book that they have picked out according to my tastes. By the time I die, I will have a library curated especially for me. I can’t imagine anything better.I like sci-fi and adventure, but now I read books I would never have known about. Recently, I enjoyed String Theory – David Foster Wallace’s book about tennis – and a biography of Alexander The Great.The first week of every month I get a brown cardboard package through the letterbox. Inside, the book is wrapped in brown paper with a royal blue ribbon. It’s like getting a birthday present every month. It’s a prize I can share: when I finish a book, I lend it to my friends at work. I’m living at my mum’s at the moment. The books are piled up on a couple of shelves in my room but I’m running out of space. My girlfriend is a keen reader, too, and we have a picture in our minds that one day we will have a home with a bay window, surrounded by book shelves, where we can just sit together and read my collection.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/172b22a3e75cf99cd62a34fa84de6d17539ae332/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29e053df67939d020d1137206f939dc4","title":"blind date james harry","story":"James, 28, an advertising director, meets Harry, 23, a director and film-makerWhat were you hoping for?Someone who could change my life for ever – and some good headshots for my LinkedIn profile.

Its importance was marked out in sewn domestic niceties: embroidered tray cloths, cheval sets and tea cosies. My home had a sewing machine in the corner, an ever-ready sewing workbox by my mother’s chair and a box that brimmed with buttons for us children to rifle through by way of entertainment. This was my material world.Living in industrial Glasgow, a city grimed with soot, smog and smoke, my landscape was monochrome until the day, when I was about six years old, my mother took me to an Aladdin’s cave in the city centre. There she bought me linen cloths already stamped with floral flourishes, packets of gold-tipped needles and silver scissors with handles shaped like a bird’s wings – and she let me choose loops of embroidery threads from a carousel of colours that dazzled me.I had never seen so many hues of green, such a variance of red, blues that stretched from daybreak to midnight skies and all the shades in between. It was a revelation. On my way home, I held my trove of colours tight in my hand. Such a rainbow was treasure and it was mine. When there was little I could call my own, this bundle of sewing materials represented not just luxury but the thrill of sole ownership.Even today, I cannot pass a display of embroidery threads without my heart missing a beat. Sometimes I even dream about textiles. I trail my hand through long-forgotten fabrics – crepe de chine, duchess satin, tulle net – grazing my knuckles on a crust of beading, smoothing down lengths of fringing and stroking the braille of lace. When I wake, it is always with the sharp pang of loss because the textiles I touch in my dreams have never existed, so there’s no hope of their rediscovery.It was my mother who taught me how to sew. She guided me through the simplest of stitches – back stitch, blanket stitch, lazy daisy, French knots – and, through them, I discovered another way of writing, inscribing my cloth with motifs and patterns that seemed to speak of an elsewhere, a world more delicate than the rough and tumble of my own.My dolls became dressed in sumptuous gowns encrusted with beads the clothes I eventually learned to make for myself were graced with decorative stitchery. I liked the demands of embroidery, its requirement for concentration, its quietude. Its absorption offered me a retreat from the bluster of family life. Being the youngest of four children I had no place of my own. I shared a bedroom with my sisters and was squeezed among my three siblings in the back seat of the car. Grouped, as we were, by my parents into “you four” or “you children”, any sense of separateness was elusive.But, through sewing, I could delineate a personal physical space. Needlework cocooned me in a privacy of sorts and while I have never lost my love of sewing as a private pleasure, in my chosen career path as a community artist, I made my sewing into a public art. Through sewing, I devised projects to involve socially marginalised people, encouraging them to create large-scale banners and wall hangings so they could tell the stories of their lives. I discovered a different kind of peacefulness in community sewing: the collective concentration and camaraderie of a common endeavour.When I began to research my book, exploring the social, emotional and political significance of sewing, I discovered that during the Second World War, women who had crafted quilts and signature cloths in POW camps hadn’t made them in jolly spirit-reviving sewing bees. Instead, each woman sewed privately, reclaiming solitude and inidual expression among the overcrowded and claustrophobic atmosphere of a camp where they were registered as a number. Through their embroidery they made time for themselves and through their sewn autographs they asserted their identity.I read about Ruth First, the anti-apartheid campaigner who, faced with long-term imprisonment in solitary confinement, took up needlework to take control of her time. On the back of her lapel she stitched seven black lines to mark her days, but then would unpick one or two as if to gain time, or go forward at her own pace by sewing down the days that lay ahead. Hers was an act of both rebellion and self-preservation.Today, in prisons throughout Britain, the organisation Fine Cell Work involves hundreds of men in embroidering items to sell online or make to commission. Paid for what they create, these men also stitch alone in their cells, finding respite from the clang and boom of prison life in the small oasis of peace afforded them by the rhythmic, repetitive act of sewing. Their needlework brings them sensory salve in the silken slip of thread and the soft crumble of cloth, a tactile antidote to the harsh and hard environment that surrounds them.After the First World War, doctors experimented with getting shell-shocked soldiers to embroider as a way of healing mental scars and it proved a surprisingly effective way of steadying their hands and settling their minds. The Disabled Soldiers’ Embroidery Industry was established offering war-torn ex-servicemen, isolated in their homes or in makeshift hospitals, the opportunity to earn some much-needed income and rebuild their self-esteem. From the unlikely marriage of men of war and fine needlework, occupational therapy was born and has remained a mainstay of medical practice ever since.There have been many studies exploring the relationship between creativity and well-being: the benefits, particularly for those suffering from mental illness, of the mesmeric immersion in crafts as a relief from inner turmoil. I know for myself that it is what I turn to to cope with anxiety and, at times, grief. The banner I made for the chapel at Stirling Royal Infirmary, to commemorate the 16 children and their teacher who were shot dead in Dunblane in 1996, became a way for me to stitch down the sorrow I felt at the loss of my own children after two miscarriages. In the time and contemplation taken – embroidering an angel, her skirt strewn with poppies of remembrance, her arms wrapped protectively around a child – I found another way to mourn, a solace of sorts.When my sister and I sat with our dying mother, for four days and nights I sewed. Although, by that time, she was in a coma, I like to believe she sensed our presence, heard me describing my work-in-progress and acknowledging the skill she had passed on to me. I still have the cloth I embroidered then. It evokes our last days together, connects me to her still and gives me comfort. This is the healing power of sewing: a way to express, sometimes exorcise, pain using a tactile language scripted by a needle and thread.Sewing is increasingly becoming recognised as an effective way to combat depression, the absorption demanded by needlework – its flow – calming the mind and reducing stress. The sense of accomplishment can boost mental health and improve our immune system, as relief from the pressure of multitasking is replaced by focussing on one thing.Today, through social media, people who are mentally frail can share their interest and skill in sewing without having to encounter the challenges of the wider world. The blog @sewcialists is a platform for those who have discovered a coping mechanism for mental illness or depression through sewing, helping them to connect by sharing stories. Sewing can also benefit dementia sufferers, translating their reminiscences into tactile quilts. Fashioned from vintage patterns and textures, they provide a sensory trigger to memory, as a prompt to conversation with carers and relatives. In our social media age, as we become more physically distanced from each other, sewing is a safeguard to isolation, a way to stay in touch with each other: hand and mind working in harmony to convey what lies in our hearts. For me and others, it sustains not just a sense of self but of belonging.Threads of Life: a History of the World Through the Eye of a Needle by Clare Hunter is published by Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton at £20.

I remember thinking, “I’ll still be good then” – and here I am.I do wonder if part of why I’m still relevant is because I haven’t had surgery. I look real. The popularity of plastic surgery shows the insecurity women feel. We can lose touch with ourselves with the menopause and become frantic that the physical aspect of us is what is going to keep men happy. But a human being’s real needs are about warmth.My father was a great listener and talker. He was intent on saying: “If you are interested in people you will always have friends.” I think he was completely right. Listening well is so important.Conversation is always the most important part of my day. A lot of people don’t look at each other when they talk these days, but it’s not for me to make judgments about people being on their phones all the time.I was an anxious child and don’t think I would have been very good at social media if I were a girl today. It is important to notice. I’ve always been sensitive to moods and nuances. I’m amazed when I see people blather on without seeing how someone is feeling.We are living a malady of narcissism at the moment. It is everywhere, particularly in politics in the US – the lack of truth, the preening, the lying. It’s dangerous and creating such terrible disdain of the other.I never planned on going to America and being part of the Hollywood scene. I had no burning desire to be there. I stayed there because I fell in love with someone.On the rare occasion that men were sleazy with me back then, it was just out of the question I would function on that level. I didn’t swear back then, but learned a few words I used when necessary.My father used to call and say: “Do you still have your self-respect?” And I would say: “Yes, Daddy.” What he meant was: are you still a virgin? I answered truthfully. I was a late-bloomer. At a certain point he stopped asking.Ambition is something to be careful with. Being greedy is rarely a good idea. It’s normal to want to get better at your job or your art if you’re well-focused, but I think if you’re climbing a mountain it is best to do it a step at a time, with a sure foothold.

Then, when the mercury drops, we’re somehow shocked that the sun is setting at 4pm, our monthly budgets are desperately contorting themselves around Christmas obligations, and we’re spending 20-30 minutes every weekday morning in silent negotiations with every instinct inside us that’s demanding we stay cocooned up in bed as the working day approaches.I’m one of those ungrateful types who says silly things like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by late August, which is testament to this annual amnesia. Sure enough, when winter comes around, I’m obsessively looking for any remnant of spring and summer to warm my spirit as I wait for the clocks to go forward again.Sunday is my day to fuel up on enough cosiness to see me through five days of early starts and pitch-black evenings, so all food, entertainment and activities must be warming and mellow. Cooking shakshuka for breakfast means I can let the stove’s heat wash over me (an alternative to using even more energy on central heating) as I impatiently watch my red sweet peppers soften in the wok, waiting for the perfect moment to add first the passata (I’m fussy about tomato chunks) and then the eggs. I eat hurriedly, using hunks of toasted sourdough bread as cutlery, racing to get the warmth in me before heading out into the chilly air.I don’t go far, as I’m lucky to live over the road from the epicentre of cosiness, Columbia Road flower market. The trees that line my street have been stripped bare by winter, so the market’s weekly bloom feels like walking back into May and June, even if I am balled up in a fleece and thick jogging bottoms. Strolling down the alleys that lead from the main road to the market, the sound of buskers singing blues music creeps up on me, accompanied by clinking pint glasses and pub chatter. To my right, windows framing candlelit cafe tables draw me in, leading my eyes to racks of 1970s tableware, costume jewellery and plant pots that spill out from a higgledy-piggledy shop and on to the wonky paving slabs.After I finally accept there isn’t a place in my house for a crystal glass decanter – a decision I re-examine every time I pass this shop – I join the crowded flow of bodies heading to the flowers. Towering bamboo overshadows us for a brief moment, giving way to a flurry of colour that feels psychedelically incongruous in the grey, dead January chill. I walk through, watching out for bewildered jack russells and small children, to soak up the sea of bottle-green house plants and flamboyant bromeliads, inevitable roses and hundreds more I can’t name – some that look like hummingbirds, some that look like pineapples (but aren’t), fussy ones that I’d likely kill in a week, and hardy types I could hopefully neglect without guilt. Then I loop back, looking for something to take home.My choice is slightly limited as I usually go towards the end of trading, when the lifestyle influencers have stopped taking photos and the sellers, eager to avoid lugging home too many spare cheese plants, offer discounts. By this point you can get a couple of really great bunches of flowers for a fiver, so I try to play florist and work out which colours and shapes are going to go together. Now it’s been winter for a good few months, I’m drawn to flowers that make me feel like I have the sun on my face – pretty little purple flowers that you’d see in a British park in summer, and sweet, warm orange petals that conjure up the taste of Soleros.While the flower market is full of life and colour, it is still winter, and I’m still cold. I timed my central heating to come on 20 minutes before I get in, so warm air greets me as I push the front door open with my bum, to avoid crushing my bouquets. I place the flowers on the kitchen side, and begin cutting the stems with inadequate scissors, the mixture of hard work and warm radiators bringing feeling back to my cold fingers. I make a feeble arrangement and stick them in a vase that I use because it belonged to my nan, despite its irritating tendency to tip over. They’ll live by the window, which looks out on marketgoers clutching their huge, leafy houseplants and marching home in single file like leafcutter ants in scarves and coats.Coffee made, slippers on and the house toasty, I squish myself into a corner of the sofa and get under a blanket that’s been warming on my radiator. As I lazily watch Netflix (or binge Beyoncé live performance videos on YouTube if I’m home alone or with sympathetic friends), I look up at my new bunch of flowers poking out from behind my TV. Their colours distract me from the grey skies and dull brick walls in the window behind them. I’m reminded that winter is temporary, the warm will return, and it will be so intoxicating I’ll say nonsense like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by August again.To stay snug and cosy, download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck – you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

But why?“It’s the tangibility of having this collectible format and a way to play music that isn’t just a stream or download,” says techno DJ Phin, who has just released her first EP on cassette as label boss of Theory of Yesterday.“I find them much more attractive than CDs. Tapes have a life, and unlike digital music, there is decay and death. It’s like a living thing and that appeals to me.” Phin left the bulk of her own 100-strong cassette collection in Turkey, carefully stored at her parents’ home, but bought “20 or 25 really special ones” when she moved to London. “I’m from that generation,” she says. “It’s a nostalgia thing – I like the hiss.”At the independent record store Rough Trade, marketing manager Emily Waller can’t say whether customers are actually playing the cassettes they buy. “It’s still a nice put-me-in-your-pocket keepsake or collectible for a fan. Old stuff is hip, right? We’ve seen through vinyl sales the increase in demand for these ‘retro’ formats, particularly among young people.”Cassette culture is thriving in the electronic music, DIY and avant-garde scenes where labels such as Manchester-based Sacred Tapes and Ireland’s Fort Label Fruit are pushing tapes to fans via online music platform Bandcamp. The cheap cost and fast turnaround of manufacturing cassettes is a key part of the appeal for those committed to the cause.“Vinyl has got so expensive to manufacture these days, especially if it’s only a seven-inch you’re putting out. You’ll only lose money on a seven-inch release,” says Tallulah Webb, who runs cassette-only label Sad Club Records. “Cassettes are an exciting way to put music out, in the same way that seven-inch singles were exciting for punk. They have always been a crucial part of the DIY scene.”But not everyone is keen. Peter Robinson, founder and editor of Popjustice, believes the trend for tapes is a gimmick too far. “Cassettes are the worst-ever music format, and I say that as someone who owns a Keane single on a USB stick,” he says. “I can understand the romance and the tactile appeal of the vinyl revival, but I’m actually quite amused by the audacity of anyone attempting to drum up some sense of nostalgia for a format that was barely tolerated in its supposed heyday. It’s like someone looked at the vinyl revival and said: what this needs is lower sound quality and even less convenience.”“I think labels know full well that almost every cassette they sell is going straight on a shelf as some sort of dreadful plastic ornament,” he says. “I don’t think it’s much different to the recent trend for pop stars adding pairs of socks to their merchandise lines, the crucial difference being that, for better or worse, socks don’t count towards the album chart.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe3d8cbd7b6e4bf73991f27e3d64bff64ab4bbde/0_54_2808_1684/master/2808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e461f5ffc749d418b9d0976b3dbbcc","title":"ennio morricone composer film makers directors cliches music","story":"As one of cinema’s greatest composers, he has written the music for hundreds of films, including classics such as A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, recreating the wild west of Sergio Leone’s imagination with a soundscape of haunting whistles and cracking whips.But, after a lifetime’s career in both Hollywood and European cinema, Ennio Morricone is now settling scores of a different kind. In a book based on extensive interviews with the famously private man, he attacks film-makers who, he says, fail to understand the power of music to heighten emotions – and some fellow composers for enabling them to regard a soundtrack as merely “something that plays in the background”.“There are times … when you get to the recording stage without having the slightest clue as to the director’s expectations,” he says in the book, Ennio Morricone: In His Own Words. Now 90, he recalls the US filmmaker and Halloween director John Carpenter commissioning him to write the score for The Thing: “He hardly said a word.” Don Siegel wanted Morricone’s music for the 1970 western Two Mules for Sister Sara, starring Shirley MacLaine and Clint Eastwood, but “we didn’t communicate much,” he says.The composer remembers that his fellow Italian Franco Zeffirelli asked for music “devoid of themes, a music of moods and atmospheres”, but “when the music was ready … said, ‘You didn’t write any themes.’”Roland Joffé, the British-French director behind The Killing Fields, also comes in for sharp criticism from Morricone, who wrote the score for The Mission, which starred Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons. “What makes it most difficult to compose a score are those directors who need to know and control every detail of their work, and therefore don’t let composers do their job,” he says. “In my career, I have met many of that kind … Joffé, one of the most peculiar under this profile. Relationships must be based on trust.”The composer, who has adapted his musical style to almost every conceivable movie genre and since 1960 has scored more than 450 films, is kinder to Leone, who, he says, “intentionally left space for the music to be listened to” and adapted his camera movements to its sounds. But he is critical of composers who, he argues, have been complicit in dumbing down their art. “Film composers have themselves underestimated their own contribution and, in so doing, they have made directors and producers accustomed to very fast working times – not the least by resorting to myriads of clichés,” he says.John Williams, the acclaimed writer of the Star Wars scores, is “an exceptionally gifted composer whom I greatly respect”, but even he is criticised for making “a commercial choice” about the space epic franchise. It was, he says, “understandable, but still commercial. I could not have scored Star Wars in that way”.He adds: “What seems hazardous to me is to associate a march, no matter how well written, to outer space. Oftentimes, solutions of this sort stem not so much from the lack of creativity or skills, but from mere commercial concerns – as consequences of the rules imposed by the film industry … Speaking both as a composer and a filmgoer, I believe that a rather simplistic standardisation of stylistic choices has made film music less interesting over the years, in terms of both conceptual depth and compositional methods.”Ennio Morricone: In His Own Words, edited by the composer Alessandro De Rosa, is published by Oxford University Press next month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a610f9d357ea566f7b90d9ddb03103cfa2c9fdf9/884_807_5132_3081/master/5132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6702f39d789bb7d95e62a269e47e30","title":"little simz grey area review uk rap maverick","story":"The waiting game can be long and lonely – just ask Little Simz. The 25-year-old rapper has released two albums and will drop her third, Grey Area, this week. There have been props from Kendrick Lamar – who once called her “the illest doing it right now” – and tours with Lauryn Hill and Nas. A spot on Forbes’s prestigious 30 Under 30 list. A track with Gorillaz and another that was featured on hit HBO TV show Insecure. And yet for the past nine years, Simz, AKA Simbi Ajikawo, has evaded household-name fame. Her last album, 2017’s Stillness in Wonderland, was reviewed positively but didn’t reach the Top 100. Her star has risen in tandem with grime’s renaissance and yet that hasn’t translated into the kind of accolades given to Stormzy and Skepta. You do not see her name atop festival bills like her contemporaries J Hus and AJ Tracey. “The silence surrounding Little Simz’s name,” said one critic, “has become deafening.”Perhaps that’s because the north Londoner was always a touch ahead of her time. Born to Nigerian parents in Islington, Simz starred in various television shows and released a whopping five EPs before her first album, in 2015. That was long before Cardi B had charted with Bodak Yellow and Stefflon Don sashayed on to sold-out tours. Simz was making weird, narrative hip-hop with bold concepts (Stillness in Wonderland came with a graphic novel, an exhibition and festival) before triple-threats like Kojey Radical bounced forth, blurring the boundaries between performance artist, poet and rapper. Her tunes trilled with trumpets before the UK jazz scene properly erupted and made those sounds popular once more. (She has also, it’s important to stress, remained independent throughout, self-releasing her records through her Age 101 imprint.)Or maybe it’s because Little Simz’s sound hasn’t hit the right note yet. There is a lot to be said about the fight to occupy a space when your male peers are taking up all the room, especially in the bloke-heavy world of rap. Women, for the most part, have had to create new paths while their male counterparts get given a free pass down the established ones – even more so, it seems, when your image is not overtly sexualised. Simz’s approach has been to explore the areas in-between – mixing up genres, being more experimental than her peers – but it has sometimes been to uncertain effect.At first, her music was lumped in with grime, but in fact it cast around for other sounds: dubstep, jazz, down-tempo hip-hop, neo-soul. Reviews, including my own in 2015, suggested that while she had undeniable technical flair, Simz still had to “find her voice”.By which they meant, partly, that she didn’t quite fit in with whatever was currently going on in music. Maybe Simz didn’t break through because female MCs used to be a hard sell. Maybe it’s because she wasn’t grime enough for grime fans but too grime for, say, 6 Music listeners (the type that like Young Fathers). But while her last album, brave and huge in scope, was certainly incomparable to anything else at the time, it’s also possible that she just needed some bigger tunes.On Grey Area, those are in abundance. It swings. It grooves. It’s not bogged down by a self-consciously poetic concept. And it feels like a record rather than a showcase, anchored by the production work of Simz’s childhood friend Inflo. He is the Timbaland to her Missy, and gives her songs the glue they needed. Born Alex Baranowski, the producer and film composer seems to have taken notes while working with Danger Mouse on Michael Kiwanuka’s 2016 album, Love \u0026amp Hate (in an industry game of tag, Kiwanuka appears on Grey Area’s final track, Flowers). There are big, chunky breaks, fat funk dollops, the crackle of US soul, touches of cosmic jazz and cinematic strings – also reminiscent of Adrian Younge’s work with Ghostface Killah. The lead tune, 101 FM, features the best instrumental since Stormzy’s Shut Up.Simz, meanwhile, has unlocked a new level of versatility. Her tracks were always soberingly serious, but here there is humour, and songs that border on the feelgood. Offence is Simz at her most Missy, deadpanning playfully bravado lines such as “I’m Jay-Z on a bad day, Shakespeare on my worst days” over a deliciously grainy Quincy bassline. On Boss, she hollers through a megaphone like a whooping bluesman as she takes out the men who distract her.Simz has said in interviews that she dislikes being referred to as a “female MC”, but gender inequality has proved a fertile ground: on Venom, she spits “they don’t wanna address that I’m the best here for the mere fact that I’ve got ovaries” over taut, horror-score strings. Men, she continues, never give women credit because they “don’t like pussy in power”. She is not quite the voice of a generation – her tracks are too inward-looking for that – but she could be, given time. On Wounds, with a pleasing croon from Jamaica’s Chronixx on the chorus, her bars survey gang crime and gun violence with a detached brilliance.Simz has said that making Grey Area was “like therapy”, after a dark spell where she questioned the isolation of trying to, as the cliche goes, make her own way. Smidgens of her struggle with alienation and questioning her career path pepper her tracks – “I’m so selfish,” goes Cleo Sol’s sweetly sung chorus on Selfish, while Flowers looks at the “27 club” of dead stars and wonders what the real price of fame is.Mega-stardom might never be hers in the end, but Grey Area sets out a different kind of stall anyway: Little Simz is a slow-burner, and now that she’s found a slicker sound, there’s no telling where she might go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

I am afraid this is not going to work,” he said.But the Conservative former minister Nick Boles, who is backing moves to delay Brexit if there is no deal, welcomed the intervention of the three cabinet ministers. “I think it is courageous and it is principled, and I applaud them for doing it,” he told Today.In a joint newspaper article in the Daily Mail on Saturday, Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, the justice minister, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, said they wanted to ensure the UK does not crash out of the EU without a deal on 29 March. They said they were prepared to defy the prime minister and join those MPs pushing for an extension to article 50 if there is no significant progress next week.The ministers said a no-deal Brexit would wreck the country’s economy and put security at risk. “If there is no breakthrough in the coming week, the balance of opinion in parliament is clear – that it would be better to seek to extend article 50 and delay our date of departure rather than crash out of the European Union on 29 March,” they added.“It is time that many of our Conservative parliamentary colleagues in the ERG recognised that parliament will stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit on 29 March. If that happens, they will have no one to blame but themselves for delaying Brexit.”It comes after the  revealed cabinet ministers will make it clear they believe May should step down after the local elections in May and allow a new leader to take charge of the next phase of the Brexit negotiations.Senior figures in government have suggested they want the prime minister to leave shortly after the first phase of the Brexit negotiations finishes, or risk being defeated in a vote of no confidence at the end of the year.May wants to stay in place for long enough after Brexit to secure a political legacy beyond the fraught negotiations. But some ministers believe she should announce the timeline for her departure “on a high” after the local election results, paving the way for a Conservative leadership contest over the summer.Brexiters in the cabinet are keen to see a new leader take over for the next stage of the negotiations with the EU, which May has already pledged will involve more active involvement for politicians rather than advisers.The hardening mood among cabinet ministers on the timeline for her departure will place further pressure on May before a critical week of Brexit talks and votes amid a febrile climate in Westminster.She will fly to an EU-Middle East summit on Sunday, where she will hold bilateral meetings with senior figures including the European council president, Donald Tusk, as part of attempts to secure “legally binding” changes to the backstop.Downing Street said the prime minister had spoken to 26 of the EU’s 27 leaders in the past fortnight, as she tries to convince them to make changes she can sell to MPs.“She will have a period of engagement again, on Sunday and Monday, with EU leaders,” a spokesman said. “She has said it is not easy.”The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox – whose legal advice on the backstop is critical to convincing Brexiters to support the deal – will return to Brussels on Monday, as technical talks between the two sides continue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96b016b6c5099c5e1a289f5c20d0de9574b26fb5/0_334_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32e8a1c3a8441845781c3d34a472c571","title":"brexit what happens the next day if there is no deal","story":"If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, what will be the immediate impact on your finances, rights and travel plans?In a sentence You’ll have to request a green card from your insurer if driving to Europe after 29 MarchCurrently, a driver of a UK-registered car is allowed to drive anywhere in the EU, the EEA (European Economic Area), Switzerland and Serbia, and not have to carry a green card that proves you have insurance cover.But if the UK leaves without a deal, all changes and drivers will be expected to carry a green card when in mainland Europe and Ireland. They are likely to be issued by an insurance company for free, but the industry is warning it could take up to a month to obtain one, so if no deal happens and you’re booked to go away with the car this Easter, you will need to act fast.The official advice from the UK government is: “From 29 March 2019, in the event that there is no EU exit deal … drivers of UK-registered vehicles will need to carry a motor insurance green card when driving in the EU and EEA.”Note that a green card (and they do have to be on green paper) typically lasts only 90 days, and if your insurance renewal comes up while you’re abroad, you will need one for each cover period. The card applies to the vehicle, not the driver.Direct Line insurance says: “In the event of a no-deal Brexit, we have plans to ensure customers are provided with a green card if they drive in Europe on or after 29 March. Customers will need to contact us at least two weeks in advance of when they are due to travel.”In Ireland, where 30,000 drivers commute across the border daily, and where shoppers from Dublin frequently head to Belfast and vice versa, the green cards issued are likely to be valid for one year. Irish insurers have prepared 400,000 green card forms in the event of no deal, and some UK insurers are now proactively sending green cards to customers in Northern Ireland.Insurers say they are already incurring hefty costs to organise the cards and prepare their staff in call centres to handle an inevitable barrage of questions. The Association of British Insurers says it would much rather none of this was happening. “It remains the case that insurers do not want a no-deal Brexit it would be bad for the economy and bad for our customers,” it says. “We continue to hope these arrangements are never needed and urge the government, UK parliament and EU27 to agree an orderly way forward.”In a sentence You will have to buy an International Driving Permit to drive in Europe, at a price of £5.50, with different ones required for France and SpainIf there is no deal with the EU then recognition of UK driving licences in the EU ends. So British drivers will have to go to the Post Office and obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP), which you will need to carry with you in conjunction with your UK driving licence.There is a curious twist to the international rules which means that if, say, you drive through France and into Spain, you’ll need two different IDPs. That’s because the 1949 IDP convention covers Spain, Malta, Cyprus and Ireland, while the 1968 IDP convention covers all other EU countries, plus Norway and Switzerland.So at the Post Office you have to specify which permit you want, depending on which country you are visiting, or get both if driving between France and Spain or Portugal and Spain.And just to add a little more complexity, the permit you buy for Portugal will last three years, but in Spain you’ll have to renew it every year.The Post Office has set up a webpage dedicated to this process. But you can’t buy it online – you’ll have to head to a Post Office with your driving licence, passport and a passport-sized photograph.As regards driving back and forth between the UK and Ireland, there has been significant confusion.Last September the government’s official position was that an IDP would be required if driving across the Northern Ireland border. But in January this advice was withdrawn, and it now says: “If you hold a UK driving licence you should not need an IDP to drive in Ireland from 29 March as Ireland does not currently require IDPs to be held by driving licence holders from non-EU countries.”It was also revealed this week that British citizens resident in Ireland – estimated to number about 300,000 – will be required to swap their UK driving licence for an Irish one at a fee of €55 (£48) if there is no deal on Brexit. PCIn a sentence They will no longer be valid and buying travel insurance will become essentialFor years, Brits travelling, studying and working in Europe have relied on the European Health Insurance Card (Ehic) that entitled the holder to state-provided medical treatment if they fell ill or had an accident in an EUEEA country.Two weeks ago, the UK government issued its latest advice on healthcare when travelling abroad, warning that if the UK leaves with no deal, our Ehics will no longer be valid.It has advised anyone travelling on or after 29 March to any of the EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, to buy travel insurance to cover healthcare “just as you would if visiting a non-EU country”.It has said it is seeking agreements with countries on healthcare arrangements for UK nationals after Brexit day, but no such agreements are in place yet. Those studying or working temporarily abroad already won’t be able to buy travel insurance as they have already left. They will probably just have to risk it as, alternatively, they face having to buy expensive local insurance, which will run into several hundred pounds.Ehic was never intended to cover long-term residents who had moved to another country, but many relied on it particularly if they spent only part of the year abroad, or for when they had just arrived in a new country. MBIn a sentence: Visa-free travel to Europe ends, paving the way for possible £52 90-day visasIt’s arguably the craziest prospect of all, but if the Brexit impasse is not broken, British tourists face having to apply for a visa to visit most of mainland Europe.That was the warning from Brussels this week where reports say there is a very real prospect of UK citizens having to apply for a €60 (£52) visa to enter the Schengen area, which includes most of the EU countries we generally visit.The problem concerns talks that have become mired in a dispute with Spain over whether the British overseas territory Gibraltar should be described as a “colony” in the EU’s statute book.If no solution can be found the UK will be left in legal limbo as it is not on the list of countries where a visa is required to visit the EU, nor on a list of countries with an exemption.It could mean UK citizens heading to Europe for Easter having to pay for a Schengen visa or be left waiting for a bilateral deal. In a tit-for-tat move, EU citizens coming to the UK would face a similar scheme. Further down the line, the EU is proposing an electronic visa waiver system valid for three years at €7.Questions also remain about how travellers will be treated when they arrive in Europe. Portugal is the only EU state so far that has said it will create a third lane at airport passport control to speed Brits through. Without a deal, they face having to queue with all non-EU passport holders, with the inevitable long delays. MBIn a sentence The government promises to keep EU flight delay payouts, but airlines could use changes to fight having to pay outEuropean Union flight compensation regulations have been fought in almost every UK court, so could a no-deal Brexit give the airlines another opportunity to stop paying passengers after a lengthy delay or cancellation?That’s the warning from lawyers this week – in spite of government promises that in the event of no deal, passenger flight rights will remain. The EU Withdrawal Act provides that EU regulations – as applied now – will convert into domestic law, meaning the same rules will continue to apply until legislators in the UK decide otherwise.On the face of it, passengers will still be able to claim to up to €600 (£536) in compensation when airline problems cause their flight to land more than three hours late, or is cancelled. They will also be entitled to meals and hotels if the delays are caused by problems beyond the airline’s control.However, with just over a month to go, specialist flight compensation lawyers say there has been no explanation as to how it will work. The compensation rules currently apply to all airlines based in the EU, and flights out of EU airports on non-EU-based carriers.The wording of the new legislation would have to watertight, says Coby Benson, solicitor at Bott and Co, because in the past the airlines have used any ambiguity to dismiss legitimate claims, and have fought them through the courts.“We anticipate that if the new adopted legislation is not entirely clear, the airlines will seize upon this to allow them to wriggle out of paying. This has been the history of this legislation from the start, and I can only foresee further court battles. If the airlines spot a get-out opportunity, they will try to use it to their advantage,” he says. MBIn a sentence The EU pet passport scheme ends for UK travellers and their cats and dogs – replaced with expensive tests every time they travelIf you were planning to take your dog or cat on holiday to Europe after a no-deal Brexit, you may want to think again after you have read this.The UK’s participation in the European Union pet passport scheme in effect ends on 29 March. It means that cat and dog owners (the documents also mention ferrets) will need to show that their animals are healthy – and produce new documents to support their animal’s health when they arrive in the EU.Pet owners will also have to show that their animal been effectively vaccinated against rabies by undergoing a rabies antibody titration test at least 30 days after inoculation, and no fewer than three months before they enter the European Union.Pets will need to travel with an animal health certificate issued by an officially registered vet. This certificate can only be issued up to 10 days prior to entry into an EU member state.This comes at a time when many veterinary practices are already experiencing worker shortages and recruitment problems, it says. The advice is to book well ahead if you’re planning to take your pet abroad. MBIn a sentence Phone companies say they have no plans to reintroduce charges – but don’t rule them out eitherArguably the EU’s most significant consumer benefit of recent years has been the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges. The EU first capped then finally scrapped roaming charges across mainland Europe in June 2017.It means EU citizens can use their mobile in another EU state as if they are at home. Call plans that typically include 500 free minutes and 2GB data can be used abroad without incurring extra charges, which, before the EU’s intervention, regularly cost more than the flight to your destination.But if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, has confirmed there will be nothing to stop mobile operators reimposing the charges.So hooked on smartphones have we all become, a return of roaming charges might be considered one of the worst impacts of leaving the EU.The biggest providers – Vodafone, O2 and EE – confirm they have no plans to reintroduce them on 1 April, but equally have not ruled out their reintroduction. Only Three has promised not to reinstate them irrespective of the Brexit outcome.Currently, EU mobile phone networks are not allowed to add extra charges to calls made by customers of other EU operators. That ends with a no deal.O2 says: “We will be working closely with the government and other European operators to try and protect the current arrangements, so our customers can continue to enjoy free EU roaming.”A future trade deal with the EU would include the abolition of, or limits to, mobile roaming charges, they have said. MBIn a sentence Retirees to Europe should worry about the future of their state pension, but private pension issues were largely resolved this weekThe 200,000 British citizens aged over 65 who have retired to the EU – half to Spain – still don’t know if their UK state pension will be uprated every year after we leave the EU, or whether they’ll join the “frozen’ pensioners” in Canada and Australia who have seen their pensions shrivel.The government has committed to uprate pensions across the EU in 2019 and 2020, but after that will only go ahead if there is a deal. It says: “We would wish to continue uprating pensions but would take decisions in light of whether, as we would hope and expect, reciprocal arrangements with the EU are in place.”If they are not uprated, it could leave retirees in poverty and force a return to the UK. Someone retiring to Australia 20 years ago still receives the basic weekly UK state pension rate of £66.75 prevailing at the time.But there’s better news on private pensions. For months the UK pension industry has been in limbo around whether they can look after a private pension taken out in the UK if the person has retired to the EU. But this week the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in Frankfurt said providers could continue to operate much as before, even with no deal.Steven Cameron of Aegon says: “There were concerns that UK providers might have been unable to service the policies of such iniduals. We very much hope EU regulators will confirm they are following EIOPA’s recommendations and will not treat these policies as ‘cross border’ which should allow servicing to continue.”Investments in funds, such as equity Isas, should be unaffected with a “temporary permissions regime” in place even if we crash out.In a sentence The EU-mandated £85,000 safety net will remain and the vast majority of UK account holders should be unaffectedThe immediate impact of no deal on UK bank account holders is likely to be minimal, but the cost of card payments between the UK and the EU is likely to rise and processing times become slower.Banks report that they have been receiving calls from worried Brits living in the EU who regularly access their UK-based bank account. Will a hard Brexit mean they can no longer use these accounts? The banks are assuring customers that they can continue to use them and transfer money overseas as they did before.Even if a bank appears to be from an EU country, there are few issues. For example, both Santander UK and Bank of Ireland (UK) are domiciled in the UK for regulatory purposes and post Brexit will be treated exactly the same as Lloyds or Barclays.However, there are those who are domiciled outside the UK and use EU membership to “passport” their services to the UK. But even here agreement has been reached, with a temporary permissions regime allowing them to carry on in the UK for three years after Brexit, and apply for authorisation during that time.The £85,000 protection for deposit accounts is partly the product of EU directives.But the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) says: “FSCS protection for UK-based customers of UK authorised firms will not change, regardless of whether the UK leaves with or without a deal.” PC"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad913087be81f9f522e91a73ee2f3ee141e53d95/313_1104_4420_2652/master/4420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=587396366bbdb85b42b8a024746b9fee","title":"labour promises universal right to flexible working from day one","story":"Dawn Butler to tell conference women need an economy that works for them, not against themA Labour government would give everyone the right to choose when they do and do not work from the day they are employed, its shadow women and equalities secretary will tell Labour’s women’s conference on Saturday.“Women do the vast majority of unpaid care, but this must not be a barrier to women in work,” Dawn Butler will say. “That’s why I’m announcing Labour’s plans to introduce rights to flexible working from day one of employment.“This change to the law is essential to closing the gender pay gap and dismantling the structural barriers that hold women back from promotion and progression.

Its leader Josip Tito defied Moscow’s hegemony and promoted what he called independent roads to socialism.“This is my first visit to Slovenia as foreign secretary, not the first in my life, but my first in a professional capacity,” Hunt said. “And I’m really happy to be here, because as a fellow European country the UK is very proud of the transformation there has been in Slovenia over the last 30 years.“A really remarkable transformation from a Soviet vassal state to a modern European democracy, a member of the EU, a member of Nato, a country with a flourishing economy, growing its tourism year in, year out, and this is really an example of Europe at its best.”The former speaker of Slovenia’s national assembly Milan Brglez criticised Hunt for “arrogantly lecturing” his country and rebuked its own politicians for not picking up on the gaffe. He said they may not even have noticed the “insult”. “We have never been ‘the vassal state of the Soviet Union’,” he wrote on Facebook.“At a minimum what I expect from my representatives is that they will react immediately when someone insults the state and its citizens. And not that they are meekly silent, perhaps not even noticing the insult.”In a related gaffe reported by local media, the UK’s Slovenian embassy tweeted that Hunt was in the country to meet Karl Erjavec, when in fact he left his role as foreign secretary last year.Hunt is increasingly gaining a reputation for high-profile errors.

After three years as Italy’s head coach, he still has to taste victory in the Six Nations and it is set to be unlucky 13 for the former Ireland full-back when his countrymen visit Rome on Sunday.Since losing in the Italian capital six years ago, Ireland have taken it out on the Azzurri. The average score in the past three meetings between the sides is 59-11 in favour of the Six Nations champions, who go into the game knowing that only a bonus-point victory, and a substantial contribution to their points difference, will keep them in contention for the title, regardless of the outcome in Cardiff the day before.Italy are without their captain, Sergio Parisse, who is suffering from concussion. The hooker, Leonardo Ghiraldini, will lead the side and is the one survivor from the team that started the 22-15 victory over Ireland in 2013, their sole success against them in the championship.“If we work on the things we can control, we will be competitive against Ireland,” said O’Shea, who won two of his 35 caps as a full-back against Italy, one of which ended in defeat in Dublin in 1997, three years before the Azzuri were added to the championship. “Our intensity must be high. The road we are on is the right one but the results must start to come too.”With England at Twickenham to follow in a fortnight, if the start is to occur in this championship then it is most likely to be in the final round when France drop in at Stadio Olimpico on 16 March. Wales turned up in Rome two weeks ago with a largely reserve side as they tested their resources ahead of the World Cup but Ireland have chosen their strongest available back ision while resting three of their front-five forwards.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsJohnny Sexton will make his first appearance in Rome since 2011, when a late drop-goal by his replacement that day, Ronan O’Gara, gave Ireland a 13-11 victory. Sexton’s deputy, Joey Carbery, suffered a hamstring strain in training on Wednesday during a session when the full-back, Jordan Larmour, and the No 8, Jack Conan, sustained injuries that put them out of contention.“We would have started Johnny anyway as he needs game time,” said the Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt. Sexton has been on the field for 103 minutes this year and 80 of those were spent on the back foot against England.“We have rotated a bit at forward to give guys an opportunity and I hope they grab it with both hands.”One of them is the hooker, Sean Cronin, who makes his first Six Nations start having sat on the bench in 33 matches in the tournament since making his debut in it as a replacement against Wales in 2010. It is only the second time since the second round in 2010 that Rory Best is not starting in the position in the championship. The flanker Peter O’Mahony leads the side in his absence.“I am sure that Sean is excited,” said Schmidt. “He has come off the bench and made an impact any number of times so why not do it from the start? It is not that he does not know that we have faith in him. He is very much team-oriented and will want to put his best foot forward and he is up against a very experienced opponent.”The flanker Maxime Manda is one of five changes made by O’Shea following the defeat to Wales, with Braam Steyn moving to No 8 to cover for Parisse. “I have waited a long time for this,” said Manda, who won the last of his 15 caps 11 months ago. “We have worked hard and studied Ireland who have a very unpredictable style of play.”Unpredictability is not a charge that has often been levelled against Schmidt’s Ireland, who after the defeat to England in the opening round were accused of lacking a Plan B. Garry Ringrose and Robbie Henshaw are missing from Ireland’s midfield but the presence of Sexton, who lasted 23 minutes against Scotland in the last round before an accumulation of hard, borderline tackles forced him off, will test a defence not renowned for its resilience.“Johnny plays flat to the line and when you do that, you are going to get hit,” said the Ireland kicking coach, Richie Murphy. “There is a fine line between what is fair and what is not, but he is not going to change the way he plays because he would then not create holes for others. He is a confrontational character who needs to play the game he feels is best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7e40691cb80e02a683d08f63a8537d5405cec3c/0_0_3017_1810/master/3017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec05a2f1c6eaf40388a674e817f12d60","title":"france v scotland six nations 2019 live","story":"53 min France 15-3 Scotland: Peter Horne, who had been off for a head injury assessment, returns to action.

He’d knocked on in the build-up, so it wouldn’t have counted anyway. 50 min France 15-3 Scotland: There’s a break in play as Scotland winger Tommy Seymour receives treatment for an injury to his left wrist, which he injured while putting in a tackle. He’s passed fit to continue for now, despite looking in extreme discomfort. 49 min France 15-3 Scotland: “USE! USE!” shouts referee Nic Berry as French scrum-half Antoine Dupont stands behind a ruck wondering what to do with the ball. 44 min France 15-3 Scotland: Brilliant airborne take from Damian Pernaud a few yards in front of the Scottish line, the winger beating two Scotsmen to pluck an excellent Ntamack kick in behind from the sky. That’s outstanding. 45 min France 15-3 Scotland: Apologies for flashing up an incorrect score in the previous entry. Scotland are in possession just outside their own 22, but cede possession when Sam Johnson passes forward. His mistake in such a dangerous area earns him a rollocking from his skipper, Greig Laidlaw. 44 min France 15-3 Scotland: That was a marvellous try, featuring strong running, several excellent offloads, a charge and a delightful chip-and-gather from Mathieu Basteraud before Huget went over. Scotland’s only touch of the ball in this half before France scored was their own kick-off. France pick-up where they left off, coming from their own 22 to go over the Scottish line, with Yoann Huget finishing a wonderful team move. Thomas Ramos fails to add the extras, hitting the post. 41 min: Scotland kick off with a seven-point gap to close.

Wenceslas Lauret steals the ball and another opportunity is wasted by Scotland as they throw long. 34 min France 10-3 Scotland: Down to 14 men for another two minutes, France lead by seven points and have missed one easy(ish) penalty and had two tries disallowed. That’s a potential 17 points they’ve left behind them so far – a sign of their dominance, but will they be punished for their carelessness? 32 min France 10-3 Scotland: A woeful penalty kick from Thomas Ramos leaves the scoreboard operator with nothing to do, but in better news from France, their captain is back from his HIA and looks like he’s been given the all clear to continue. 30 min France 10-3 Scotland: Gael Fikou goes over, latching on to a wonderfully timed chip-kick under pressure from Romain Ntamack.

With a shake of his head Guirado jogs off the pitch and down the tunnel. I’m surprised he wasn’t sent immediately after receiving treatment a few minutes ago, to be honest.

The ball comes back inside and Horne take a massive hit from Guirado that prompts an intake of breath from those in the stands. Fair play to Horn, he held on to the ball and got back to his feet immediately. Scotland have a penalty in a kickable position, but Greg Laidlaw hits the post .

Horne kicks for the French ten metre line. 17 min: France 10-0 Scotland Completely in control of this game, France win another penalty in front of the Scottish posts after Blair Kinghorn refuses to release the ball after retrieving the ball under pressure from a French kick-and-chase. Thomas Ramos slots the ball over. A brilliant counter-attacking try by France, who scythe through the Scotland defence with a glorious running move. Th0omas Ramos, Damian Pernaud and Antoine Dupont were all heavily involved as they built from deep, with Pernaud taking a massive hit from Nick Grigg as he offloaded to Dupont. Up in support, Ntamack touched down under the posts and the bonus points are duly added. 12 min: France 0-0 Scotland: France go through the phases - eight so far - to go within seven metres of the Scotland line. Excellent defending by Scotland, who win a penalty and another chance to clear their lines. Great running by Basteraud there, running at the heart of the Scottish defence like an angry bull. 10 min France 0-0 Scotland: France on the front foot and Sean Maitland takes a ferocious thump from Damian Pernaud, who flattens him as he barges through him. France win a penalty and kick for touch, with Demba Bamba snatching the ball from the air. France are dominating proceedings here. 9 min France 0-0 Scotland: Laidlaw passes deep to Kinghorn, who boots clear from the five-metre scrum. It’s a fine clearance by the full-back. TMO: Referee Nic Berry consults with his TMO, Rowan Kitt, looking for a possible knock-on in the build-up to the try. He spots one!!! Five yard scrum and Scotland have the put-in. 7 min France 5-0 Scotland: Gael Fikou and Mathieu Basteraud are stopped just short of the Scottish line after a great chip kick. After a great off-load that suck in two Scottish defenders, the ball’s played out wide to French prop Jefferson Poirot, who goes over in the corner despite a challenge from Greig Laidlaw5 min France 0-0 Scotland: Scotland have possession and are trying to advance up the pitch, ruck after ruck, breakdown after breakdown. Nick Grigg loses it and France are back in possession just outside the Scottish 22. 3 min France 0-0 Scotland: Scotland’s rolling maul is illegallly dragged to the ground, earning them the opportunity to clear their lines from the penalty. Play resumes in the middle of the park, with Scotland in possession. A box kick from Laidlaw is chased by Jamie Ritchie, but France full-back leaps highest to catch cleanly. 2 min: France 0-0 Scotland: Scotland kick for touch but France win the line-out, stealing possession. Antoine Dupont makes good yards for France, who win a line-out about five yards from the Scotland line. France don’t contest the line-out, opting to try to drive for the line. It doesn’t work – Scotland get their maul on and drive the French pack up the pitch. 1 min France 0-0 Scotland: On the whistle of former scrum-half turned referee Nic Berry, France get the ball airborne with outside-half Romain Ntamack doing the honours. Sean Maitland catches and takjes a big hit and Scotland win a penalty when several over-enthusiastic French players come in from the side. Kick-off is just a couple of minutes away: Following stirring renditions of Flower of Scotland and La Marseillaise, the very last of the pre-match formalities are under way. Play will begin very shortly. Here’s hoping for a good one ... The teams are in the tunnel ... and out they march on to the Stade de France sward, to an enthusiastic welcome from the 80,000 French supporters who haven’t lost faith in their team. There are pyrotechnics and cheesy Europop galore, while the supporters wave their standard issue tricolours. Touch judges: Nigel Owens (Wales) and Andrew Brace (Ireland)From Stuart Bathgate’s match preview: Of the Scotland team’s key quartet, only the captain, Greig Laidlaw, is in the squad, Finn Russell having joined Stuart Hogg and Willem Nel on the injury list this week. Factor in other absentees such as Huw Jones,, Ryan Wilson and Hamish Watson, and it may seem that this game is France’s to lose. But that also appeared to be the case at half-time in their last home game, before they went on to surrender a 16-0 lead to Wales.“Given such an ignominious collapse was followed by a heavy defeat at Twickenham, it is evident self-belief is in short supply in the French ranks, as Jacques Brunel implied when asked if, by naming his team two days early, he were not giving the Scots an advantage. “After seeing our performance against England, Scotland must be pretty confident anyway,” the head coach said.One of the worst French teams in living memory host injury-ravaged Scotland with both teams in dire need of a win. France have lost both their opening matches, the most recent defeat being an extremely heavy one at Twickenham. Now on his third full-back in as many matches, France coach Jacques Brunel has made four changes and several positional switches, completely revamping his backline in the process. His opposite number, Gregor Townsend, has been forced into making the same number of changes, the main one being the introduction of Peter Horne at fly-half to replace Finn Russell, who is injured. Kick-off at the Stade de France is at 2.15pm (GMT), but stay tuned for team news and build-up.

Founded in 2017, the group organizes young people to fight climate change and support the Green New Deal.When Feinstein pushes back on the young activists’ request, one child says: “The government is supposed to be for the people, by the people, and all for the people.”“I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’ve been doing,” Feinstein responds. “You come in here and say it has to be my way or the highway. I’ve gotten elected. I just ran. I was elected by almost a million vote plurality and I know what I’m doing. Maybe people should listen a little bit.”“I hear what you’re saying,” a teenage activist says. “But we’re the people who voted you, you’re supposed to listen to us.”“I’m 16,” the young woman responds.“Well, you didn’t vote for me,” Feinstein says.Later in the clip, Feinstein tells a young activist, “Well, you know better than I do. So I think one day you should run for the United States Senate and then you do it your way.”“Great, I will,” the teenager responded.The senator issued a statement Friday evening: “I want the children to know they were heard loud and clear,” she said, misstating the group’s name as the Sunshine Movement. “I have been and remain committed to doing everything I can to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation.”The senator reacted “with smugness + disrespect”, the Sunrise Movement tweeted on Friday, sharing a video clip of the meeting. “Her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress.”By Friday night, the video the Sunrise Movement shared on Twitter, which had been edited and focused on clips of the most tense moments from the meeting, had been viewed more than 3m times.The full video of the meeting between Feinstein and the young activists was also available on the group’s Facebook page. Some viewers said they found the full video, which includes more conciliatory moments between Feinstein and the young protesters, less shocking than the edited version.In the full video, Feinstein repeatedly urges the young activist to read her draft legislation and explains the reasons she cannot support the Green New Deal. “There’s no way to pay for it,” she tells the children.“It doesn’t have a single Republican vote, and the Republicans control the US Senate,” she adds. “I’ve been in the Senate for over a quarter of a century, and I know what can pass and I know what can’t pass.”The Green New Deal, a proposal that aims to fight inequality and tackle climate change at the same time, is being advanced by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among other Democratic lawmakers. The proposal could face a vote in the senate as early as next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6e10d9ef6b01219d1599716f07fe54e37094524/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96ba37019a63d383a726eebe42f77660","title":"italian mps demand answers over claims salvinis league sought kremlin funding","story":"Salvini spokesman says claims of Moscow meeting to fund the party are ‘fantasies’Italian opposition politicians have demanded an urgent explanation from the government after allegations surfaced accusing Matteo Salvini’s far-right League party of links to the Kremlin.According to claims made in L’Espresso magazine, an arrangement was struck to sell 3m tonnes of diesel fuel to an Italian oil company by Russian representatives close to the government of Vladmir Putin, erting profits to the League.The claims, based on a forthcoming book, The Black Book of the League, by two of the magazine’s journalists, raises questions about the relationship between the Kremlin and the anti-immigrant party, which is in a coalition government with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement.A group of opposition senators described the claims as worrying. “Russia is financing the League? The worrying report by L’Espresso needs to be immediately clarified by the government,” the centre-left Democratic Party said in a statement.“It is claimed that a Russian energy company sold supplies of petrol to an Italian firm with the objective of financing Salvini’s Europe campaign. This is not the first time that the League has been involved in embarrassing relations regarding its special rapport with Putin.”Laura Boldrini, a former parliamentary speaker and a member of a small opposition party, LeU, wrote on Twitter: “Russian finances for the League’s electoral campaign? – Salvini must clarify this immediately because if it is confirmed, it would be really concerning.”The authors admit they have no evidence that the deal was ever executed, but claim it was being negotiated at a meeting at a Moscow hotel last October.They claim the meeting was on the same day Salvini was in Moscow for an Italian business convention, during which he slammed EU sanctions against Russia as “economic, social and cultural madness”. They allege that the gathering took place hours after Salvini met Dmitry Kozak, the Russian deputy prime minister who is responsible for energy policy.The League has been developing ties with Russia since 2013. Salvini has long admired Putin, posting a photograph on social media of their first encounter in 2014. In 2017, the League signed a co-operation agreement with the ruling United Russia party.Last June, Salvini reacted angrily to a suggestion by billionaire financier George Soros that the League was receiving money from the Kremlin. “I have never received a lira, a euro or a rouble from Russia,” Salvini said.Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss university in Rome, said that while the League was very careful when it came to the party’s finances, there was a clear “common vision and tactical convergence” with the Kremlin. “Their interests are the same: national sovereignty and attacking the EU,” Panarari said.A spokesperson for Salvini said: “We are not commenting on fantasies”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bb50887263b7331cb01c252a4b70ef62f3663a8/0_156_4176_2506/master/4176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fcd5f6d333e2284584687162b348e74","title":"venezuela brazil border aid live news latest updates","story":"Clashes have intensified in Urena, on the Venezuelan side of the border with Colombia. Venezuela’s National Guard fired tear gas on residents clearing a barricaded border bridge between Venezuela and Colombia.A military outpost near the Venezuela-Brazil border has been taken over by a pro-regime militia, according to VPI TV. Members of the anti-regime National Assembly are inside.Clavel Rangel reports from Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela:A second Venezuelan has died from injuries inflicted by the Venezuelan military, when they opened fire on indigenous protesters on Friday. Rolando Garcia had spent the night in intensive care in Brazil, before dying on Saturday morning from his injuries. He was shot while trying to shield his wife, Zoraida Rodriguez, who died soon after the shooting. Both had gunshot injuries to their abdomen. They had not joined the protest, but their house is just beside where the clashes broke out, and they were hit there by stray bullets.Garcia had worked as a guide in the Gran Sabana area, one of the country’s most spectacular and a popular draw for tourists.His employer, the ecotourism NGO Apetoy Tours, remembered him as an “exemplary guide.” “Rest in peace Rolando Garcia...never again a horror like this,” they wrote on Twitter.Four members of the Venezuelan National Guard have defected this morning along the border with Colombia.Three defected at the Simón Bolívar bridge and a fourth guardsman defected on another border bridge, a Colombian immigration official told AFP.A Spectator reporter tweeted a photo of the four guardsmen who deserted their posts and crossed into Colombian territory.“Today begins the real breakdown of Maduro’s regime,” Cliver Alcalá, a retired general who has joined the opposition, told reporters in Cucuta, according to the Wall Street Journal. “It will mark a tipping point.” Anggy Polanco reports from Tachira, Venezuela on the “Women in White” who have been leading protests at the border with Colombia:Venezuela has closed the border with Colombia before. One closure lasted for nearly a year, until the blockade was broken by a newly organised group of protesters known as “the women in white”.They have grown into a powerful force in Tachira state, and are back at the front of border protests on Saturday, forming a human chain to get food and medicines stockpiled by the opposition into Venezuela, in defiance of a government ban.“This aid must cross,” said Lucero Valero, 37, an accountant currently working as a manicurist, and one of the main leaders of the movement.The women first came together over frustration over shortages of medicine, food and basic hygiene and cleaning products, easily available in Colombia but already scarce and expensive in Venezuela.“It began because one woman needed a prescription that she couldn’t find anywhere, and that led to our organisation,” said Valero, who joined a group of around 80 women at the border in late June 2016.They were turned away by the military on that attempt, but instead of being discouraged persuaded 700 women, all dressed in white, to join a second attempt on 5 July. This time they succeed in breaking through two military cordons on the San Francisco international bridge, and reached Colombia so they could buy what they needed.Claudia Perez was key to the success of that protest. Her husband had been stranded on the Colombian side of the border when it closed, and her two daughters, then three- and 15-years-old, were with her in Venezuela.She took her two girls along to the bridge and told her youngest to remove the barrier blocking the crossing, while she pleaded with soldiers, telling them that her daughters didn’t have milk and she was on her period and needed sanitary supplies.The commander of the military blockade eventually let her through, and after that the rest of the group managed to push forward, heading to Colombia.“It really touched the hearts of the soldiers, there was no aggression. The strategy was to talk to them as mother and daughter,” Perez remembers. “No one believed we could do it, but we succeed.”Valero says that today the group is more than 1000 strong, and includes women of all ages and backgrounds, from housewives to professionals, and across the political spectrum. Some are even Chavistas who supported former president Hugo Chávez but are frustrated they can no longer get daily necessities.The group is focused on helping families meet their daily needs and aims to stay away from political movements. They were attacked as black-marketeers by a former regional governor, but have also refused to wear T-shirts with the face of an opposition leader.Although it doesn’t currently have any official status, they hope to establish it a charity in future, with a focus on the reconstruction of Venezuela and help for those who need it.“We want a return to the beautiful Venezuela we knew, where he could get what we needed without having to cross the border.”Emily Costa reports from Pacaraima, Brazil:Maria Belandria, Juan Guaidó’s ‘ambassador’ to Brazil, recognised by the Brazilian government as the country’s official representative here, went to the border after Saturday morning’s press conference and talked to some of the Venezuelans gathered there.Emma Graham-Harrison and Patricia Torres report from Caracas:In Caracas, opposition supporters are gathering for a march to La Carlotta, a military airport in the capital. They plan to ask soldiers there to defect, and let the aid through, although the latter would be a mostly symbolic decision as no aid is expected to arrive here.The crowd for now is about 1,000 strong, many wearing white, and carrying Venezuelan flags or wearing caps with the national red, blue and yellow.One demostrator, his body painted in national colours, knelt with a sign saying “For a free Venezuela, for all the fallen, and for our brothers – may God bless them.”Pro-government forces are also planning rallies in the centre of Caracas. Top Maduro ally Diosdado Cabello implied the government would let iniduals carrying aid cross the border, but “no foreign soldier would put a foot inside Venezuela”.Some of the worst violence so far has been in the Venezuelan town of Urena, where protestors stormed a school that security forces were using as a base, stripped some of their uniforms and burned them.They also seized a bus that pro-government organisers had used to bring supporters to the area, and drove it towards the border crossing. In Urena, on the Venezuelan side of the border with Colombia, guardsmen used tear gas to repel marchers from Venezuela’s Women in White, a religious group, according to Bloomberg News.The protesters were rallying people to a border barricade.Three members of the Venezeulan security forces have deserted on the Simón Bolívar bridge, which connects Venezuela with Colombia, the Spectator reports.A sergeant with the Venezuelan police who deserted said many other members of the security forces oppose the government, but are too afraid to leave. “There is fear, because there you cant talk, you cant say anything against the government,” he said. “I had the courage that many of my colleagues have not had.” The man said he had been thinking about his decision for days. “It wasn’t something I decided overnight,” he said.He called on other members of the security forces to join him, saying that millions of Venezuelans are pitted against a small circle of loyalists to Maduro. At a press conference in the border town of Pacaraima on Saturday morning, Brazil’s foreign minister said the effort to transport aid into Venezuela was well planned.“This is not an improvised thing. It happened very quickly but it is totally professional,” he said, adding that he hoped the aid effort would continue.“Brazil is ready to continue with this cooperation, as well as the United States and the Lima Group. We want this to be the first movement,” he said, referring to a group of Latin American countries that have backed the Venezuelan opposition. “We continue hoping that China and Russia and other countries become aware.”Seated beside him, Maria Belandria, appointed by Guaidó as “ambassador” to Brazil, said they wanted the aid to enter Venezuela and wanted to send a “greeting to the companions who are on the other side of the border”.In the early hours of Saturday morning she tweeted a video alongside Araújo – who also features on her Twitter profile photo – and US charge d’affaires William Popp, standing in a warehouse in Boa Vista in front of sacks of supplies. “We are here with more than 200 tons of medicine and food. Thanks to Brazil, thanks to the United States,” she said.Two trucks left Boa Vista, capital of this northernmost state of Roraima, early on Saturday under escort but so far just one has arrived in the border town. The other burst a tire while on route and is due this morning. The first truck got close to the border but then turned around. “There are many people here,” said the ’s Emily Costa in Pacaraima. She said the truck “moved close to the border, then turned around and went back. Everyone thought it would enter.”The trucks are carrying first aid kits, rice and powdered milk, the G1 site reported. The border remains closed.Protests are underway on the Venezuelan side of the border with Colombia, in the city of Urena. Protesters stormed a school occupied by a government militia, according to a New York Times reporter.Some of the militia members joined forces with the protesters. One militia member was seriously injured after falling while trying to escape. A peaceful march was planned in an attempt to diffuse tensions.Joe Parkin Daniels reports from Cucuta, Colombia:Venezuelans have been arriving in the Colombian border town of Cucuta to help shift aid across the borderLizmar Vergara, 22, who lives in Caja Seca, arrived yesterday. “I’m here for the freedom of our country. It’s the most precious, the most beautiful thing. Venezuela is magical and I will never leave so I’m here for its future,” she said. “I’m not scared because when they take your bravery they take your freedom. If they shoot at us we carry on, the freedom of Venezuela demands it.”“You smell that morning air? That is the smell of freedom,” said Nancy Barreto, an activist from from Portuguesa state. She crossed the border yesterday to help shift aid across.Hundreds slept outside Friday night, without tents, and sang the national anthem as dawn brokeSome opposition members have gathered at the Simón Bolívar bridge, which connects Colombia with Venezuela, chanting: “Libertad, libertad.”The first trucks have arrived in Pacaraima, on the Brazilian side of the border, carrying aid meant to cross over into Venezuela.Brazil’s foreign minister tweeted a photo with Juan Guaidó from the aid concert in Cucuta, Colombia, Friday night.“Still in Cúcuta, Colombia, with the Interim President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó, courageous leader of the democratic transition. Guaidó sent greetings and his effusive thanks to President Bolsonaro and to Brazil for the support for a free Venezuela,” he wrote.Here’s a dispatch from Emily Costa, who is in Pacaraima on the Brazilian side of the border:Even with the border between Venezuela and Brazil closed since Thursday night on the orders of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelans have continued to cross into Brazil in the Northern state of Roraima, walking for hours along clandestine trails.One group of seven people, including two children, arrived on Friday night at around 7pm, after walking for two hours.“We got a taxi to the trail and then we started walking,” said Antonio Isea, 33, an electrical engineer from Barquisimeto. “We couldn’t stay there, we had to get to the end of it, it didn’t matter.”Both he and Maria Eugenia Sosa, 34, another electrical engineer from Caracas, were headed for Argentina.“We were tired but we had to keep going because we already have tickets to carry on the journey,” she said.The group were waiting to register with the Brazilian authorities on Saturday morning. Venezuelans entering said security has been enforced and there are more national guard securing the border and even guarding these secret routes.“I was scared. I had never been through anything like this in my life,” said Clenni Morales, 32, an administrator from Puerto Ordaz who was carrying her five-year-old daughter.Jonas Broer, 33, an industrial engineer traveling with his son of five said he was also scared. “I walked a little and felt safer,” he said.Venezuelans have begun gathering on the Brazilian side of the border in Pacaraima, holding placards made out of cardboard, ready to help. Maritz Caña, 46, was among them. She is unemployed and used to live in Ciudad Bolívar but migrated to Pacaraima a year ago because of the crisis. “I want to face the struggle for Venezuela, to return to my country,” she said. “I want everything to happen peacefully. I am ready to go walking and carry the aid to the other side. We want the aid to enter, for the people who are dying from hunger, from the lack of medicine. All of us need this.”Good morning. Today in Venezuela, opposition leaders are trying to get shipments of aids into the country, defying a ban by the government in Caracas.Tensions are high on the country’s borders with Colombia and Brazil.

Venezuelan security forces loyal to the government of President Nicolás Maduro have been ordered not to let them through. has correspondents on the ground in Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil, and we’ll be bringing you developments as they unfold throughout the day.Venezuelans have suffered from years of shortages of food and medicine as the country has been engulfed in an economic crisis.The showdown over aid shipments turned deadly on Friday when a military convoy headed for the southern border with Brazil opened fire on indigenous protesters blocking their way, killing one person and injuring 16.Police fired tear gas on Saturday after clashes broke out among Venezuelans trying to cross into Colombia. The government has closed the border to block shipments of aid.Guaidó, who has declared himself interim president of Venezuela and is recognized by the United States and Europe, defied a travel ban imposed on him by the government and traveled to the town of Cúcuta, on the Colombian side of the border, where he appeared at a star studded aid concert on Friday night.

The girl was removed from an overturned boat on a stretch of the Abbey River, which runs through the city. It is understood she became trapped underneath the boat after it overturned when her hair had become entangled in the outriggers, used to anchor the oars to the rowing boat. Sources have said firefighters “cut the girls hair to free her” and administered CPR. She had been one of a group of young girls travelling in the rowing boat.

The release of the brigade activity reports (BAR) will give an “unprecedented insight” into the history of the Irish revolution, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence Paul Kehoe has said. Thousands of files, covering the activities of all 151 Irish VolunteerIRA brigades from 1913 to 1923 have been digitised and put online. Most of the files cover the War of Independence in depth, but a substantial minority also cover the Easter Rising and Civil War. The files include 8,300 significant events which can be searched for online such as major ambushes in the War of Independence and a drop-down menu, county by county. Speaking at the launch in Cathal Brugha Barracks, Mr Kehoe said the files will allow for the identity of iniduals involved in operations at a local level to be known and “provides a window into every parish and townland across the country”. He said the newly-released files will shine a unique spotlight on the “activities undertaken by ordinary people pursuing the ambition of nationhood”. “Through first-hand accounts, we are exposed to the less well-known or celebrated support provided by ordinary volunteers across Ireland, ” he said.“The wealth and depth of the material offers opportunities for meaningful engagement and learning by academia, historians, citizens, educational institutions and our diaspora in understanding our often complex history and key event on our path to nationhood.” He paid tribute to the public officials in the early years of the State who had kept the huge archive of the military pensions collection for posterity. Two millions pieces of paperCecile Gordon, the project manager of the Military Service Pensions Collection (MSPC), said hundreds of people have already accessed the site since it was put online at midnight and many have spent several hours reading files. To date two million pieces of paper relating to inidual pension applications and to brigade activity reports have been digitised and put online. Giving the key note address, Trinity College Dublin historian Anne Dolan said the brigade activity reports will help determine exactly who took part in inidual actions. She cited the example of one of the most famous incidents of the War of Independence, Bloody Sunday, November 21st, 1920, in which 15 people, most of them British intelligence officers, were shot dead. It was now possible, she stated, to know seven of the eight men of Michael Collins’ squad who were involved at Morehampton Park at which three men were shot dead.It was possible to do so by looking at the names listed in the BAR and cross-checking with inidual pension applicants.She said: “The obvious lesson is an easy one - the brigade activity reports give most value, serve most sense side by side with the broader pension collection that needed and depended on them right from the very point the brigade committees started sending their findings in. “But more than that it proves how powerful the pensions files as a whole are in taking us beyond the obvious figures, the officers and the higher-up, the well-known and the often interviewed, to the men and women of the revolution neither the Bureau (of Military History) or Ernie O’Malley had the time or inclination to seek out.”She suggested that the pensions files will challenge the “Dublin’s fighting story” type narrative of the Irish Revolution and there is a more complicated story beneath. Professor Fearghal McGarry of Queens University Belfast (QUB) said the pension files showed that “disappointment and disillusionment” were the dominant narrative in the pension files and that many of those who fought felt undervalued afterwards.

Photograph: AFPVatican media Pope Francis has described feminism as “machismo with a skirt” during a brief intervention at the four-day meeting on the protection of minors in the church which is taking place at the Vatican. Meanwhile, one of the Church’s leading cardinals has admitted that files on clerical child abuse have been destroyed by bishops.Pope Francis made his comment about feminism on Saturday in an off-the-cuff remark after hearing an address from a woman who addressed the meeting. “Inviting a woman to speak is not to enter into the mode of an ecclesiastical feminism, because in the end every feminism ends up being a machismo with a skirt. No. Inviting a woman to speak about the wounds of the Church is to invite the Church to speak about herself, about the wounds she has,” he said.He was speaking following an address by Dr Linda Ghisoni, undersecretary for the Laity at the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Laity, Family, and Life and one of three women among 12 speakers scheduled to give addresses to the 190 Catholic church leaders in attendance at the meeting. The church leaders include 10 other women. Ireland is being represented at the meeting by the president of the Irish Episcopal Conference, Archbishop Eamon Martin.In her address, Dr Ghisoni recalled how “a priest, a few days ago, exclaimed ‘Still? We continue talking about abuse! The Church’s attention to this theme is exaggerated’.” She continued how “even a practicing lady told me candidly: ‘It is better not to talk about these matters, otherwise there will be distrust of the Church. Talking about it obscures all the good done in the parishes’.”Referring to priests who sexually abuse children as “howling wolves that penetrate the fold to scare further and disperse the flock” she said that “becoming aware of the phenomenon and (to) understand one’s responsibility is not a fixation”.Destroyed filesIn his address to the meeting on Saturday, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, President of the German Bishops’ Conference and a member of the Council of Cardinals which advises Pope Francis, said clerical child sex abuse files have been destroyed in some dioceses.“Files that could have documented the terrible deeds and named those responsible were destroyed, or not even created. Instead of the perpetrators, the victims were regulated and silence imposed on them.”He said the “rights of victims were effectively trampled underfoot, and left to the whims of iniduals”. “These are all events that sharply contradict what the Church should stand for,” he said.At a press conference in the Vatican this afternoon he was talking about the German Catholic Church and that this destruction of documents had been established in a 2014 study conducted there. He said he assumed “Germany is not an isolated case”.In his address to the meeting, he said “establishing transparent procedural norms and rules for ecclesiastical processes is essential. Institutional mistrust leads to conspiracy theories regarding an organisation, and the formation of myths about an organisation. This can be avoided if the facts are set out transparently.”‘Mediocrity and hypocrisy’In another address, Sr Veronica Openibo, a Nigerian who has worked in Africa, Europe and the United States, berated the bishops for mistakes in handling the sexual abuse crisis, saying the Church had to acknowledge its “mediocrity, hypocrisy and complacency”.“We proclaim the Ten Commandments and parade ourselves as being the custodians of moral standards and values and good behaviour in society. Hypocrites at times? Yes! Why did we keep silent for so long?” she said.She told Pope Francis, sitting near her on the dais, that she admired him because he was “humble enough to change your mind”, apologise and take action after he initially defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up abuse. The bishop later resigned.“How could the clerical Church have kept silent, covering these atrocities? The silence, the carrying of the secrets in the hearts of the perpetrators, the length of the abuses and the constant transfers of perpetrators are unimaginable,” she said.‘Crisis and shame’She spoke of her shock when she watched the 2015 Oscar-winning film Spotlight, which uncovered how Church leaders in Boston moved predator priests from parish to parish instead of defrocking them or turning them over to civil authorities.“At the present time, we are in a state of crisis and shame. We have seriously clouded the grace of the Christ-mission,” Sr Openibo said.“We must acknowledge that our mediocrity, hypocrisy and complacency have brought us to this disgraceful and scandalous place we find ourselves as a Church. We pause to pray, Lord have mercy on us!” she said.She said Church leaders must shed their habit of hiding events for fear of making a mistake.“Too often we want to keep silent until the storm has passed. This storm will not pass by. Our credibility is at stake,” she said.Leading cardinals told the four-day conference on Friday that the Church must repair the “systematic failures” that enabled sexual abuse to take root around the world, and bishops should start policing each other’s behaviour.At the start of the conference on Thursday, five victims told painful stories of abuse and cover-up and the pope said they could expect concrete measures to come out of the meeting.Victims groups have complained that while some priests who sexually abused children were eventually disciplined by the Church and sentenced by civil authorities, the bishops who either enabled the abuse or covered it up have not been punished.The conference ends on Sunday when the pope will make a final speech. The Vatican says it will then formulate follow-up measures to make sure all bishop return home knowing how to put anti-abuse procedures into place. – Additional copy: Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"exorcisms thelutheran intercessors nigeria pictures","story":"Venezuelan soldiers defect as troops fire tear gas at protesters on Colombia border Toxic alcohol kills 93 and hospitalises hundreds in IndiaComment: The supposedly impartial BBC should hang its head in shame at the fake news it spreadsCoutts accused of failing to combat sexual harassment after confirming attendance to \u0026#39Presidents Club mark two\u0026#39Victims of violent crime denied justice as figures show huge rise in cases closed within 24 hours\u0026#39Lightweight serial conspirators\u0026#39: Campaign group led by John McDonnell attack MPs who quit Labour Venezuela troops fire teargas on Colombia border protestersComment: Sorry TIGs, but post-Blair Britain will not be duped by the pernicious lie of a \u0026#39centrist paradise\u0026#39Sudan\u0026#39s Bashir dissolves government as he declares state of emergencyExplosions and gunfire mark opening of polls in NigeriaHow a throwaway 2016 Brexit remark sowed seeds that grew into this week\u0026#39s split in both Labour and Tory partiesJihadi Jack, the Briton accused of fighting for Isil: \u0026#39I miss my mum, pasties and Doctor Who - I want to go home\u0026#39Man and woman in their 70s die in crash with van pursued by police\u0026#39Jihadi Jack\u0026#39 may miss his mum - but here\u0026#39s why he won\u0026#39t be coming home anytime soonComment: Europe\u0026#39s feckless attitude to security shows how minor a role it will play in the new geopoliticsComment: Forget breakdancing, can\u0026#39t we have competitive tutting at the Olympics?Nicolas Maduro orders Colombian border shut as Richard Branson floats second Venezuela concertCorbyn claims he has \u0026#39huge support\u0026#39 from voters after nine MPs quitDuke and Duchess of Sussex to embark on walkabout-free royal visit, after violent protests in Morocco\u0026#39MI6 conman\u0026#39 Mark Acklom extradited to UK after years on the runWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"westminster dog show 2019 pictures","story":"Wire fox terrier wins Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York on Tuesday night, emerging as the top dog among nearly 3,000 barking, tail-wagging competitors.Venezuelan soldiers defect as troops fire tear gas at protesters on Colombia border Toxic alcohol kills 93 and hospitalises hundreds in IndiaComment: The supposedly impartial BBC should hang its head in shame at the fake news it spreadsCoutts accused of failing to combat sexual harassment after confirming attendance to \u0026#39Presidents Club mark two\u0026#39Victims of violent crime denied justice as figures show huge rise in cases closed within 24 hours\u0026#39Lightweight serial conspirators\u0026#39: Campaign group led by John McDonnell attack MPs who quit Labour Venezuela troops fire teargas on Colombia border protestersComment: Sorry TIGs, but post-Blair Britain will not be duped by the pernicious lie of a \u0026#39centrist paradise\u0026#39Sudan\u0026#39s Bashir dissolves government as he declares state of emergencyExplosions and gunfire mark opening of polls in NigeriaHow a throwaway 2016 Brexit remark sowed seeds that grew into this week\u0026#39s split in both Labour and Tory partiesJihadi Jack, the Briton accused of fighting for Isil: \u0026#39I miss my mum, pasties and Doctor Who - I want to go home\u0026#39Man and woman in their 70s die in crash with van pursued by police\u0026#39Jihadi Jack\u0026#39 may miss his mum - but here\u0026#39s why he won\u0026#39t be coming home anytime soonComment: Europe\u0026#39s feckless attitude to security shows how minor a role it will play in the new geopoliticsComment: Forget breakdancing, can\u0026#39t we have competitive tutting at the Olympics?Nicolas Maduro orders Colombian border shut as Richard Branson floats second Venezuela concertCorbyn claims he has \u0026#39huge support\u0026#39 from voters after nine MPs quitDuke and Duchess of Sussex to embark on walkabout-free royal visit, after violent protests in Morocco\u0026#39MI6 conman\u0026#39 Mark Acklom extradited to UK after years on the runWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/20/TELEMMGLPICT000159430519_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"forget benefits screen time truly modern must teach children","story":"Perhaps the most modern thing we can do is to teach our children to exist beyond the world of screensHow did you learn your times tables?

I extend a sincere invitation to the opposition forces, who are still outside the path of national reconciliation ... to move forward and engage in the dialogue regarding the current issues of our country.In a subsequent decree, Bashir set up a caretaker administration comprising a senior official from each ministry, but kept the defense, foreign and justice ministers in place.Sudanese police fired tear gas today at crowds of anti-government protesters in Khartoum after organisers called for nationwide rallies against President Omar al-Bashir.The anti-government demonstrations began on Dec. 19, triggered by price increases and cash shortages, but quickly developed into protests against Bashir\u0027s rule.After Bashir\u0027s speech, angry protesters in the city of Omdurman chanted Freedom! and set fire to tyres while others blocked a main road, a Reuters witness said. Police there fired tear gas and chased protesters through small streets.The National Consensus Forces, one of Sudan\u0027s main opposition groups, said the response to Bashir\u0027s declaration of a state of emergency should be more protests.(T)he regime declared a state of emergency to counter our popular revolution, which will not stop, God willing, before we achieve our goals and topple the regime, the group said in a statement.President Omar al-Bashir greets his supporters at a rally in Khartoum, SudanTwo weeks before the protests broke out, a majority of lawmakers had backed proposed amendments to the constitution that would allow Bashir to run for another term. But last Saturday, the parliamentary committee tasked with amending the constitution said it would indefinitely postpone a meeting to draft these changes.Ahead of Bashir\u0027s speech, security forces fired tear gas to disperse at least 200 protesters in the capital, Khartoum, eyewitnesses said.The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the main protest organizer, issued a call for additional demonstrations.The demands of this revolution are clear ... foremost that this regime and its head step aside, including its repressive institutions, the SPA said in a statement.Bashir, an Islamist and former army officer, came to power in 1989 after a military coup. He won elections in 2010 and 2015 after changes in the constitution following a peace agreement with southern rebels, who then seceded to form South Sudan.Bashir had previously blamed the protests on foreign agents, and challenged his rivals to seek power through the ballot box. He had shown no sign that he was prepared to concede any power.But earlier this month he softened his tone dramatically, saying the protesters are mostly young people with poor prospects.Even then Bashir warned against destabilising the Sudanese state, saying, “You can look at what happened in Libya”, which has been in a state of turmoil since a 2011 civil war led to the overthrow of longstanding dictator Muammar Gaddafi.Activists say nearly 60 people have been killed during the protests, while authorities put the death toll at 32, including three security personnel.Security forces have used tear gas and live bullets to disperse protesters, and have made hundreds of arrests, including of opposition party members, activists and journalists.Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges of masterminding genocide in the Darfur region, which he denies. He has been lobbying for Sudan to be removed from a list of countries which Washington deems state sponsors of terrorism.The listing has blocked the investment and financial aid that Sudan was hoping for when the United States lifted sanctions in 2017, economists say. Venezuelan soldiers defect as troops fire tear gas at protesters on Colombia border Toxic alcohol kills 93 and hospitalises hundreds in IndiaComment: The supposedly impartial BBC should hang its head in shame at the fake news it spreadsCoutts accused of failing to combat sexual harassment after confirming attendance to \u0026#39Presidents Club mark two\u0026#39Victims of violent crime denied justice as figures show huge rise in cases closed within 24 hours\u0026#39Lightweight serial conspirators\u0026#39: Campaign group led by John McDonnell attack MPs who quit Labour Venezuela troops fire teargas on Colombia border protestersComment: Sorry TIGs, but post-Blair Britain will not be duped by the pernicious lie of a \u0026#39centrist paradise\u0026#39Explosions and gunfire mark opening of polls in NigeriaHow a throwaway 2016 Brexit remark sowed seeds that grew into this week\u0026#39s split in both Labour and Tory partiesJihadi Jack, the Briton accused of fighting for Isil: \u0026#39I miss my mum, pasties and Doctor Who - I want to go home\u0026#39Man and woman in their 70s die in crash with van pursued by police\u0026#39Jihadi Jack\u0026#39 may miss his mum - but here\u0026#39s why he won\u0026#39t be coming home anytime soonComment: Europe\u0026#39s feckless attitude to security shows how minor a role it will play in the new geopoliticsComment: Forget breakdancing, can\u0026#39t we have competitive tutting at the Olympics?Nicolas Maduro orders Colombian border shut as Richard Branson floats second Venezuela concertCorbyn claims he has \u0026#39huge support\u0026#39 from voters after nine MPs quitDuke and Duchess of Sussex to embark on walkabout-free royal visit, after violent protests in Morocco\u0026#39MI6 conman\u0026#39 Mark Acklom extradited to UK after years on the runCurfew, review: this tooth-rattling, future shock-thriller roars off the starter-gridWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/22/12/The-Velvet-Underground-\u0026amp;-Nico.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6695821  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= The Velvet Underground \u0026amp; Nico (1967), The Velvet Underground  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/22/12/The-Velvet-Underground-\u0026amp;-Nico.jpg","title":"ariana grande piers morgan little mix twitter ","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough.

CHShe added: “In fact that’s why I\u0026nbspsat down with him in the first place. I\u0026nbspsaw an opportunity to pick someone so opposite’s brain and try to talk some sense into them which i understand is highly unlikely but I\u0026nbspwill not apologise for trying. That’s all.”Grande said in a follow-up message she was “anything but complacent” during her conversation with Morgan, adding: “I\u0026nbspwon’t stop having conversations with people I\u0026nbspdisagree with when I\u0026nbspsee the opportunity to.”Morgan shared a photo of himself with Grande earlier this week on Twitter, saying they had spoken for about two hours.“We laughed, we argued, she cried, I nearly did, the drinks flowed and\u0026nbspwe bonded,” he wrote. “Turns out we really like each other. Weird.”The message left some Twitter users baffled, including one person who wrote: “Ew Ariana why.”Someone else tweeted: “ARIANA NO,” while another person wrote: “Don’t like this.”In addition to their spat over Little Mix, Morgan criticised Grande after the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing for not immediately visiting the victims of the attack. He apologised after Grande held the One Love Manchester concert, saying he had misjudged her.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You never change things from the outside. He should stand his ground and try to f***ing sort it from inside.”There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it? But I am a born optimistAnd yet. The more you spoke to Gallagher, and his workmates, and others, the more you sensed a certain sympathy for Shuker and the points he was making about “abuse” in the party, about failure to oppose hard Brexit, and about Jeremy Corbyn.Painter and decorator John Brydson, 68, initially described himself as a Tory-voting Brexit supporter. But it turned out the backstory was more tangled, in ways that might favour Shuker, not Corbyn. “I was Labour for 50 years,” said Brydson.\u0026nbsp“But when Corbyn came in, I changed to Tory.\u0026nbspThere will never be a Labour government while he is at the head of the Labour Party.”Shuker was one of seven Labour members to quit the party on Monday\u0026nbsp(PA)He too didn’t like the way Shuker had left the party. “But yeah, I would vote for him, even though the way he went about it was wrong.”There was a moment of reflection when you mentioned\u0026nbspKeaney’s prediction that a by-election would see Shuker “annihilated” by an official Labour candidate.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think so,” said Mr Brydson softly.MPs: Joan Ryan,\u0026nbspHeidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston (Reuters)Gallagher, meanwhile, seemed to be moving a long way in a short discussion, from “absolute rubbish” to “fair play to him”.\u0026nbspHe was an unwavering Labour man, he insisted: “All my life, working-class, always vote Labour.”But when you put him on the spot, and ask\u0026nbsphim to pick sides in a by-election fight between Shuker and a Keaney-approved Corbyn Labour candidate, there was a long pause.\u0026nbsp“Christ, you would have to go with Shuker, wouldn’t you?\u0026nbspYou would have to go sensible. The bloke with the cap, a proper lefty, wasn’t he?\u0026nbspToo much hatred in his voice, I thought.”The more ardent anti-neoliberal Corbynistas may not wish to be reminded of the old aphorism that the Labour Party owes more to Methodism than Marxism.\u0026nbspBut it was impossible to ignore as you sat in the Hardware Cafe\u0026nbspand pondered the new battle for the soul of British politics.\u0026nbspThe view from the cafe windows was dominated by the Mount Tabor Primitive Methodist Chapel, built 1897, grandeur unfaded, the names of the Victorian worthies who supported the project carved in stone for all to see.\u0026nbspMethodism still seemed to be triumphing over Marxism in 2019.\u0026nbspAl Short, 51, social worker and Christian, arrived.\u0026nbspHe still believed in the ideals of 2015, when Corbyn was promising a “kinder, gentler politics”. He regarded the Labour leader as “a pretty principled, genuine kind of guy, who cares for the poor, offers a genuine alternative.”And yet in a very gentle, very Christian kind of way, and despite his vote for Brexit, Short seemed to be warming to Shuker and this new Independent Group.\u0026nbsp“I am a Christian.\u0026nbspGavin Shuker is a Christian. I have a sense of rapport with him.”He even went as far as hoping the gang of 11\u0026nbsp(and counting) could prove a more successful update of the Gang of Four, who for a brief 1980s flurry had\u0026nbsplooked as if they might reshape British politics by leaving Labour and forming the SDP.Shuker (right) with his colleagues announcing their breakaway\u0026nbsp(PA)Short smiled, as if imagining a mildly exciting future: “There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it?\u0026nbspBut I am a born optimist.”Shuker will face an altogether feistier proposition in Short’s support-worker colleague Lorna Calliste, 42, east London-born daughter of a Trinidadian mother, now a mum to four kids by an Irish builder, and a committed Brexit supporter.\u0026nbsp“No, no, no,” was the unequivocal response to Shuker’s talk of taking a stand against “hard Tory Brexit”.But if Calliste wasn’t exactly brimming with excitement for Shuker and the Independent Group, she didn’t seem a natural fit with\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Labour either.\u0026nbsp“Labour has\u0026nbspgone silly.\u0026nbspThey want to let everyone in the country.\u0026nbspWhy can’t we have an Australian system where we let someone in if they have something to offer?”In the Hardware Cafe, you began to sense that going against his constituency’s Brexit vote would not fatally undermine Shuker, and that, however fuzzily, other elements of what the Independent Group was saying had hit home.Luciana Berger’s message was remembered, even if her name wasn’t (PA)Luciana Berger may exist in the Luton South consciousness as “the lady with the dark hair”, but many agreed with her that “what’s happening with the antisemitism is disgusting”.\u0026nbspAnd the notion that politics is “broken” sold itself.Stephen McNeilly had been excited by politics, once.\u0026nbspNow the 39-year-old electrician placed himself firmly in the camp of “the name Gavin Shuker rings a bell”.\u0026nbspHis disillusion with politics was a badge of pride, enlivened by references to Corbyn as “an absolute plank” to Brexit as a “f***ing shambles” to former Luton South MP Margaret Moran, whose life fell apart when she was caught “fiddling her expenses”.My son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a tryAnd yet, in almost the same lament, McNeilly seemed to be crying out for someone to inspire him and all the others languishing in the ranks of the disillusioned.\u0026nbsp“There’s no Martin Luther King figure,” he said.\u0026nbsp“No one with fresh ideas, no one with a voice, to make people stand up and listen.”Vividly expressed disillusion began to sound a little like an open invitation to Shuker and his Independent Group – all the more so when McNeilly turned to his own, conflicted feelings about having voted Leave.MPs have left the Labour party to form independent group“Every single thing I voted for – stopping immigration first and foremost – will be made null and void.\u0026nbspWe’re going to be financially crippled, kicked in the teeth. The dreadful thing is,\u0026nbspI would want to reverse it and vote Remain.”Perhaps all the conversations seemed to be running Shuker’s way.Why the Independent Group won’t succeed without electoral reformCabinet ministers back new Independent Group, claim Tory defectorsEx-Tory MP says battle for party is over as Brexit hardliners have wonBut then, Edward, a rather thoughtful 68-year-old, looked up from his book, and wondered whether we might be seeing things through a bit of a mainstream media haze.\u0026nbsp“My son’s 29,” said Edward, “And, I think, rather fooled by Corbyn.\u0026nbspSomehow Corbyn has got into young people, by young person’s media.\u0026nbspI suppose I am a centrist dad.\u0026nbspI’m so old I remember the Labour government of the 1970s that led us into trouble, into strikes.“But my son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a try.”But do they really, still?\u0026nbspThe University of Bedfordshire’s campus offered the chance of a probably wildly unscientific straw poll of the much-discussed millennial generation.\u0026nbspIt left you wondering whether the fever of Corbyn-mania may have cooled somewhat since the heady days of the June 2017 general election.Kieran Nixon, 23, was president of the student union, but when he spoke in a personal capacity he began to sound like a lot of others on campus.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2015 because his parents did.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2017 because of genuine enthusiasm for Corbyn.\u0026nbsp“He kind of set up this persona,” said Nixon, “that he was new, fresh, ‘down with the kids’, articulate.\u0026nbspI saw him going to festivals, saying he would clear the student loan debt.“But now it just feels like it was a pipe dream.\u0026nbspI don’t think I can see him being prime minister.\u0026nbspHe seems short of ideas, too quick to pass the blame to Theresa May.\u0026nbspHe doesn’t come up with any worthwhile solution to Brexit that could get accepted by Brussels.”“Maybe,” said Nixon, recalling that summer when he was 20 months younger and Corbyn was at Glastonbury, “going to festivals doesn’t really say professionalism.”Daisie Johnson: ‘The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Corbyn opposing Brexit’ (Adam Lusher)Daisie Johnson also liked the Glastonbury appearance, at the time.\u0026nbsp“Corbyn tries to talk to young people,” said the psychology and criminal behaviour student. “Which is more than you can say for Theresa May.”But now, the full impact of the EU referendum – in which she was too young to participate – has hit home:\u0026nbsp“The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Jeremy Corbyn opposing Brexit.\u0026nbspThat doesn’t seem to come up on the news feed.\u0026nbspI’m probably more for this other guy if he is against Brexit and Corbyn isn’t.”So no,\u0026nbspJohnson didn’t know who “this other guy” Shuker was.\u0026nbspAnd she didn’t really see how the Independent Group could turn a bit of House of Commons seating rearrangement into real change.\u0026nbsp“Where’s the majority to do anything? I don’t really get it.”Soubry and Sarah Wollaston join their new honourable friends\u0026nbspin the House of Commons (PA)But nor did McNeilly really get it when we began talking, and now he was at least a little interested.\u0026nbsp“I’ll try to catch a glimpse of what he’s saying,” said the 39-year-old.\u0026nbsp“More power to the guy: a journey of 1,000 miles starts with one step.”So what if that first step will be Shuker telling us who he is? They sneered at Macron to begin with, and he made it into the Elysee, avoiding the dustbin of history.\u0026nbspKeaney might be annoyed, but perhaps Shuker can take comfort in the fact there was even a time when no one knew who Trotsky and the Bolsheviks were either.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And because of so many great people in this room, friends, we are well on our way to doing that.”Nasa says goodbye to Mars rover with touching final messageHe noted that a whole host of observations from Mars showed that it could be a promising place for life to have once lived – or still be. It has been found to have the building blocks of life in complex organic molecules, as well as water floating beneath its surface.Nasa hasn’t ever found evidence that life exists or even could exist on Mars or anywhere else in the universe. But they do suggest that it could be a better than expected place for it to be, and makes the discovery more likely.“All of these things collude to say there is a lot we need to learn, and friends, we’re going to do it quickly,” Bridenstine said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work.

Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child.

Jennifer Lopez, Awkwafina, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Brie Larson, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Amandla Stenberg, Charlize Theron, Tessa Thompson\u0026nbspand Constance Wu will be handing out the statuettes.The show is also expected to focus on\u0026nbspwhat has been a strong year for music in film, with Best Actress hopeful\u0026nbspLady Gaga down to perform “Shallow” from the third remake of\u0026nbspA Star is\u0026nbspBorn\u0026nbspwith director and co-star Bradley Cooper.Gillian Welch and David Rawlings\u0026nbspwill perform “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings” from the Coen Brothers’s The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u0026nbspand Jennifer Hudson will sing “I’ll Fight” from the documentary RBG.\u0026nbspProducer Donna Gigliotti\u0026nbspand director Glenn Weiss have meanwhile been tasked with bringing off a leaner show this time around, running under three hours for the first time since 1973.To achieve this, some of the lower-profile awards will be handed out while the broadcast is in commercial breaks, saving almost an hour after 2018’s telecast staggered on for a gruelling\u0026nbspthree hours and 53 minutes.Which films have been nominated\u0026nbspfor the top prizes?Yorgos Lanthimos’s period drama The Favourite and Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma secured 10 nominations each.Both films are have been shortlisted\u0026nbspfor the prestigious Best Picture award, along with Black Panther (a popular choice), BlacKkKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody, Green Book, A Star is Born\u0026nbspand Vice.The Oscar nominations prove change is coming – but not fast enoughThe Favourite‘s Olivia Colman is in pole position to land Best Actress for her superb performance as Queen Anne while co-stars Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone will continue their ficitonal rivalry in the Best Supporting Actress category.Christian Bale is hotly-tipped to win Best Actor for his role as former vice-president Dick Cheney in Adam McKay’s satire while the Best Supporting Actor category drew contrasting responses from a delighted Richard E Grant and a very droll Sam Elliott (“It’s about f***ing time”).The Academy has been criticised for again failing to list a female filmmaker in the Best Director category while fans of Timothee Chalamet were disappointed his performance as a drug addict in\u0026nbspFelix Van Groeningen’s Beautfiul Boy was overlooked.You can read a complete list of the nominations here\u0026nbspand an overview of the\u0026nbspbiggest talking points from the announcement here.What happened to the\u0026nbspBest Popular Film category?The new award was announced in August but withdrawn a month later on the strength of the hostile reception it received.Critics and fans argued the category would be used as a means of sidelining crowd-pleasing blockbusters like Black Panther, keeping Best Film free for the “prestige” pictures that usually dominate.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has said it “will examine and seek additional input regarding the new category” and has not ruled out its future revival.The Academy announced in June 2018 it had invited 928 new members of the filmmaking profession to join its ranks.Part of a new initiative commenced under former Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the measure is intended to address the shocking revelation in 2016 that 92 per cent of membership was white and 75 per cent male.Invitations were extended to actors including Amy Schumer, Kumail Nanjiani, Dave Chappelle, Sarah Silverman and\u0026nbspJada Pinkett Smith as well as a host technicians, directors and executives in a bid to improve ersity and offer a broader representation of opinion.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

It was only when a flexible cover layer was developed that folding phones could happen.The Fold has a 4.7in screen when it\u0027s closed, looking like a regular smartphone, if a bit thicker. Then, it opens up to reveal a second screen inside, which measure 7.3-inches. To put that in context, many smaller tablets on the market boast 7-inch displays.So, how convenient, no need to carry two gadgets any more but still have the joys of the big screen. But, from seeing the new device, I have some initial reservations.First, the bigger display has a weird screen ratio. It\u0027s not quite square but at 4.2:3 is noticeably squarer than many tablets. Samsung displayed a Netflix movie on it, which looked great except that quite a lot of the screen was black bars on either side, which reduced the effect. I suspect it would have looked better on the smaller front display, where it would fill it entirely.This shape means you can display three apps at once, like a YouTube feed, Instagram and a web page. The YouTube element, even in the biggest window, only had a tiny video element, which also wasn\u0027t that appealing.These are early days, though, and there may well be a combination of apps which will work well together.Second, the display didn\u0027t look sensational. Although it opens perfectly flat and images can run across the two with no sense of a join, as the Fold tilted in the light, a straight line that looked like a crease was visible. Perhaps this was because it was an early sample and when the phone is released (26 April in the US, 3 May in Europe) this will have been sorted.Third, can it really justify the cost? In the US, the price starts at $1,980 and in Europe, $2,000. No UK price was given though expect it to be around £1,600 or more. For that money you could buy the Samsung Galaxy S10 and a 9.7in iPad and have a lot of cash left over.But you wouldn\u0027t have the convenience of the two-devices-in-one that the Galaxy Fold turns out to be.\u0026nbsp And in terms of innovation, a folding phone is the most exciting development in phone design for years.Samsung Galaxy S10: Best network deals in the UKThe other phones look rather more ordinary in comparison, but offer noticeable upgrades from the current Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ handsets.Both the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ feature a pretty exciting innovation, a fingerprint sensor buried in the display itself that\u0026nbspallows\u0026nbspthe screen to stretch across the whole of the front of the phone. Well, almost.There\u0027s a tiny punch-hole in the S10 screen, a bigger one on the S10+, where the front-facing camera (or cameras on the larger phone) sit.Samsung says that the technology it\u0027s used, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, is the most advanced around and in my brief use of it, it\u0027s very fast indeed and in a day or so\u0027s use recognised my thumbprint 100 per cent of the time –\u0026nbspa little better than rival in-screen sensors from Huawei and others.There is a downside to this tech: It won\u0027t work through thick screen protectors, so check before you buy a protector for your phone.Both cameras also adopt triple camera units on the rear with two 12-megapixel sensors offering wide and super-wide lenses. The wide lens has an automatically adjusting aperture to allow more light in when there\u0027s not much there. The third sensor, backed by a 16-megapixel sensor, is an ultra-wide lens with a field of view which Samsung says matches that of the human eye.The new phones also have two-way wireless charging so that you can place a friend\u0027s wireless-compatible phone against the S10 or S10+ and charge it from the Samsung. Testing it with an iPhone XS Max, it worked instantly and is a very satisfying feeling. Huawei had this feature first, but it\u0027s something every phone should have.The S10e offered some of the S10\u0027s features in a smaller form, so every hand size may find something that fits. But you\u0027ll need big mitts to encompass the final phone release of the evening, the S10 5G. The difference here is, can you guess, it works on 5G networks. It\u0027ll be released in May and has a 6.7in display, the biggest Galaxy S phone yet.The Fold on its own puts Samsung out there when it comes to innovation, but the new Galaxy S10 range –\u0026nbspyou know, the ones most of us will consider buying –\u0026nbspoffer enough choice and a big step forward from last year\u0027s S9 range. The addition of the super-cool inscreen fingerprint sensor on the S10 and S10+ along with the new triple cameras will be enough to tempt many.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The watchdog said\u0026nbspSolarplicity’s\u0026nbspcustomer\u0026nbspservice “has been poor for a number of months”.Between March and September last year\u0026nbspthere was an unacceptably high proportion of calls abandoned and unacceptably long call waiting times, Ofgem said.Although call handling has improved, the regulator said it “has not seen the required improvements elsewhere”.Created with Sketch.Solar powered bulbs light the way in the developing world Show all 3Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Measures Ofgem has recommended include ensuring customer contact channels are improved, managed and maintained, with queries and issues being resolved in a timely manner, and making sure the switching process goes smoothly, with switches completed within the required timescales. Mary Starks, executive director of consumers and markets at Ofgem, said: “We have taken action against Solarplicity to protect its customers from experiencing further detriment. “Solarplicity must get its house in order and provide a level of service that its customers expect.

Within an hour of liftoff, Beresheet was already sending back data and had successfully deployed its landing legs, according to SpaceIL.\u0026nbsp“We’ll keep analysing the data, but bottom line is we entered the very exclusive group of countries that have launched a spacecraft to the moon,” said Yigal Harel, head of SpaceIL’s spacecraft programme.\u0026nbspElon Musk’s SpaceX to have launches reviewed by PentagonElon Musk reveals price of a ticket to Mars on board SpaceX flightsPrime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was watching the launch live from the Israeli control centre in Yehud, near Tel Aviv.\u0026nbsp“This is a big step for Israel, but a giant step for Israeli technology,” he said.The four-legged Beresheet, barely the size of a washing machine, will circle Earth in ever bigger loops until it’s captured by lunar gravity and goes into orbit around the moon. Touchdown would be 11 April\u0026nbspat the Sea of Serenity.\u0026nbspNasa’s Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s took about three days to get astronauts to the moon, but they used monstrous Saturn V rockets.The $100m (£78m)\u0026nbspBeresheet mission could not\u0026nbspafford its own rocket – even a little one – so the organisers opted for a ride share. That makes for a much longer trip the moon\u0026nbspis currently nearly 230,000 miles\u0026nbspaway.\u0026nbsp“This is Uber-style space exploration, so we’re riding shotgun on the rocket,” Mr Winetraub explained at a news conference on the eve of launch.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspAir Force also has a small research spacecraft aboard the rocket, for a one-year mission in orbit around Earth.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System  Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Soviet Union was the first to put a spacecraft on the moon, Luna 2, in 1959.

Last month, China became the first country to land on the far side of the moon.\u0026nbspApollo 11 astronaut\u0026nbspBuzz Aldrin quickly offered congratulations following Thursday’s launch. So did Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine, who called it “a historic step for all nations and commercial space as we look to extend our collaborations beyond low-Earth orbit and on to the moon”.\u0026nbspNasa\u0026nbsphas a laser reflector aboard Beresheet and is offering its Deep Space Network for communication.\u0026nbsp“All the best to @TeamSpaceIL as it starts its journey tonight on a @SpaceX #Falcon9 from Florida to my old stomping ground ... the moon,” Aldrin tweeted.\u0026nbspThe Beresheet mission originally was part of the Google Lunar XPrize competition and even made the final cut before the contest ended last year without a winner. The organisers decided to press ahead on their own, with donations from billionaires as well as schoolchildren.\u0026nbspLunar surface operations are meant to last just two days. Beresheet will measure the magnetic field at the landing site, and send back data and pictures. A time capsule is aboard the lander — which includes a picture of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003 — as well as a lunar library containing 30 million pages on a disk from the US-based Arch Mission Foundation.\u0026nbspRamon’s widow, Rona, was a big supporter of Beresheet she died of cancer in December.\u0026nbspFollowing liftoff, SpaceX recovered the first-stage booster, which flew twice last year. The booster landed smoothly on an offshore ocean platform, after the hottest re-entry yet, according to SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk. Sparks from burning metal were visible in the landing video.\u0026nbspMr Musk said the booster will fly a fourth time in April, during a launch abort test of the new crew Dragon capsule.

Shares slumped again in january after another disappointing update.It emerged last year that new chief executive Rico Back had received a £6m payment when he joined from General Logistics Systems, a Dutch firm that Royal Mail owns.His total pay packet for this year could hit £2.7m while outgoing chief executive Moya Greene received a £900,000 payout.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or at least that’s what we were told by Liam Fox in 2017.The confidence beaming from the international trade secretary as he set off on his world tour to convince governments to do business with “global Britain” was notably absent this week.With little to show for his efforts, Fox\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspforced into an embarrassing climbdown, finally conceding that many of those\u0026nbsptrade deals had no chance of being ratified by 29 March.\u0026nbspSo where are we now – and why has Liam Fox fallen so far short of his own bar?No deal will be done in time with valuable trading partners Turkey and Japan, nor with the tiny European principalities of Andorra and San Marino.\u0026nbspCan UK continue trading with countries covered by an EU trade deal?Fox has so far delivered just six of the 40 deals he promised. The biggest positive he can point to is an agreement with Switzerland, a country which took £20bn of UK exports in 2017.By comparison, the UK shipped £278bn of goods and services to the EU in 2017. A deal with the trading bloc, Fox told us, would be “the easiest in human history”.\u0026nbspThe only other agreements he has so far been able to finalise in close to three years of toil account for a tiny percentage of UK trade. Israel is the largest among these, buying £2.4bn of UK goods and services, with £1.6bn flowing the other way.Agreements sealed with the Palestinian territories\u0026nbspand the Faroe Islands will do little to keep post-Brexit Britain afloat. We also have a deal with the 21 countries which make up the Common Market for\u0026nbspEastern and Southern Africa, but only Egypt accounts for anything more than a negligible amount of UK trade.Among the remaining countries in the group are two, which, according to official figures, imported no UK goods last year: Eritrea and Comoros.There is of course a chance that agreements will be reached in the next 35 days but Fox’s announcement hardly inspires confidence.He attempted to reassure the public with news that formal agreements are close with Fiji and Papua New Guinea.\u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspsimply served\u0026nbspto highlight the lack of progress on agreements with far more important trading partners.True, we have some form of agreement with the US, Australia and New Zealand but these mostly cover product standards. They aren’t full trade deals.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, CEO for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocate“Particularly intensive discussions” are happening with the European Economic Area, South African Customs Unions, Canada and South Korea, the trade secretary says – which sounds distinctly like they won’t be signed in time.It all seems like tinkering around the edges when you compare the figures involved to the vast sums of trade we conduct\u0026nbspwith the other 27 EU member states.None of this is to say that our trade secretary has been incompetent or lazy. No one said rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic was easy.\u0026nbspAnd negotiating trade deals is\u0026nbspeven more fiendishly complex – they frequently\u0026nbspamount to hundreds of clauses covering standards and tariffs on vast\u0026nbspnumbers of products.Deals often take\u0026nbspyears to finalise, even for skilled negotiators focused on one agreement, let alone 40.Whether through arrogance or ignorance, Liam Fox did not listen to trade experts who said dozens of EU deals could not be “rolled over” with ease.\u0026nbspHe assured everyone it could be done, but that was never truly the case.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Having to say bye to my dad when he’s in handcuffs just hurts my heart. It’s like immigration doesn’t want my family to succeed.”During a meeting at the Jamaican High Commission, the child –\u0026nbspsurrounded by her three sisters, the youngest just a toddler, and mother – delivered a moving testimony that shed light on the impact of immigration control on families.The meeting took place two weeks after\u0026nbspa charter flight taking 29 iniduals from the UK to Jamaica prompted outrage in the wake of the Windrush scandal. Commissioner Seth George Ramocan organised the gathering in the hope that it would\u0026nbsphelp\u0026nbspinform discussions about how they cooperate with the Home Office on future deportations.But there was little discussion about policy or intergovernmental cooperation. From the outset, the meeting was highly charged with emotion, with\u0026nbsprelatives giving\u0026nbspheart-rending accounts of having their loved ones “snatched” from them and sent against their will to a country that, often, they barely knew or remembered.The mother of one man who was on the charter flight – after coming to the UK aged 11 –\u0026nbspexplained how her son had arrived in Jamaica with no one to care for him, and made a passionate plea that “all of our children who came here when they were young should be here.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

The same can be said for an unusually high number of gazebos on College Green – the patch of grass outside the House of Lords from which journalists broadcast to the nation.This week an aerial view of the Palace of Westminster was beamed into living rooms across the country as another dramatic week in British politics unfolded.At 10am on Monday, seven MPs quit Jeremy Corbyn‘s Labour Party with a withering assessment of his leadership – the biggest schism in the party since the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the 1980s.May eyes potential route out of Brexit deadlock in BrusselsPost-Brexit Britain won’t have any trade links left at this rateEU’s Juncker says he is not optimistic about avoiding no-deal BrexitBarclays sets aside £150m to prepare for Brexit falloutThe following evening, an eighth MP left Labour’s ranks and on Wednesday – an hour before prime minister’s questions – Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen left the Conservative Party to join the opposition benches.Together, the 11 MPs have formed the Independent Group in the House of Commons and, though they have not yet formed a political party, the group has more MPs than the Democratic Unionist Party and the same number as the Liberal Democrats.It means Theresa May‘s effective majority in the chamber has been reduced to eight, making her reliance on the DUP to prop up the government ever more important.While this week has undoubtedly increased the instability at Westminster, the parliamentary arithmetic for Brexit hasn’t shifted a great deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Labour split: the reaction on Twitter Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The prime minister still faces the mammoth task of getting her deal through the Commons and, regardless of which side of the Commons the three ex-Tory MPs are sitting on, it is unlikely they will suddenly drop their opposition to Ms May’s deal.Support for a fresh referendum still does not appear to command a majority in the chamber, and the likelihood of the prime minister declaring her support for a customs union (one of Labour’s red lines) remains slim at best.But the current turmoil will inevitably have a considerable impact on the debate. The hardline Brexiteer Conservative MPs in the European Research Group – wary of the effect more defections from the party could have – may provide the prime minister with a temporary show of unity as she continues to negotiate with Brussels.And with just 36 days\u0026nbspuntil Brexit, wavering Labour MPs wanting to avoid a no-deal scenario may feel more inclined to back Ms May’s proposals.

Europe Correspondent Jon Stone\u0026nbspwalks us through the examplesClick to followIndy PoliticsMerkel and Macron are not expected to come to Britain’s rescueEuropean leaders are gathering this weekend in Sharm el-Sheikh, where Theresa May hopes to discuss Brexit with them. But Britain’s exit from the EU is far from the only thing\u0026nbspon their minds. So how is Europe’s domestic politics affecting the Brexit process?Arguments over the status of Gibraltar play well in Spain, and Spanish governments of all stripes have tried to inject the issue into the Brexit process. So far this has been more of a nuisance than an existential threat, but Spain’s ability to veto any future trade deal could become a serious problem down the road. Spain disputes British sovereignty of the territory.Ireland is the EU country most directly affected by Brexit. In Ireland, to a much greater extent than the UK, a hard border on the island of Ireland is politically very unpopular. As a result, the Irish government has said it will not accept a border in any circumstances,\u0026nbspeven in a\u0026nbspno-deal scenario. This has caused problems of its own: Ireland’s position has made it harder for the EU to convince sceptical Brexiteers that the backstop is necessary.Emmanuel Macron isn’t going to Sharm el-Sheikh, but he has arguably been one of the most influential figures shaping the overall EU response to Brexit. A committed centrist, Mr Macron sees it as his duty to fight reactionary populism, a view shaped by the rise of the National Front in France. He sees Brexit as a strain of this politics and has pushed for the hardest line against Britain.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The plan seeks regulatory alignment on goods and food, ergence on services, freedom from the European Courts of Justice and an end to free movement.

She asserts this amongst continued attacks on her approach to Brexit by Boris Johnson and the European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees MoggQuite the blow was dealt to the Prime Minister at a EU leaders summit in Salzburg on September 20. European Council President Donald Tusk stated that the Chequers deal will not workFollowing the rejection of her Chequers plan the day before, the Prime Minister voiced her anger that the EU had dismissed it without offering an alternative. She stated that “throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.As the People\u0027s Vote campaign and The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign gain traction, 700,000 people turn out in London to demand a final say on the UK\u0027s Brexit deal on October 20 2018As the Prime Minister settles on a Brexit deal, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab resigns along with Work and Pensions secretary Esther McVey and many other ministers3542 Final Say petitions delivered to Downing StreetPeople\u0027s Vote supporting MPs Chukka Umunna, Justine Greening and Caroline Lucas and The Independent editor Christian Broughton deliver over a million signatures in favour of a People\u0027s Vote to the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street on December 3 2018On December 10, the Prime Minister delayed the vote on her Brexit deal as it was near certain not to pass through the Commons due to Tory rebels and lack of DUP supportTory MPs triggered a confidence vote in the Prime Minister on December 12.

In the same sitting, MPs also voted against a no-deal Brexit in a non-legally binding motion4142 EU council president savages Brexit campaigners who failed to plan for departure: ‘Special place in hell’There is a “special place in hell” for pro-Brexit campaigners who demanded Britain leave the EU without explaining how it should happen, Donald Tusk has said. The European Council president launched the scathing attack as he accused anti-EU campaigners of pushing for Brexit “without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” Mr Tusk also dismissed suggestions that the EU could reopen negotiations over the controversial Northern Ireland backstop, dealing a blow to Theresa May‘s hopes of securing fresh concessions as she tries to get her exit deal through parliament. Speaking in Brussels alongside Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Tusk said: “I’ve been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for people who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” He also tweeted the accusation moments later4242 EU and UK announce talks to restart after Theresa May visits BrusselsBoth have agreed to restart Brexit talks to find “a way through” the deadlock in Westminster, following a visit by Theresa May to Brussels. In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month. But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU insteadGermany is the dog that didn’t bark on Brexit. Constant predictions have emanated from Westminster that Angela Merkel would somehow ride to the rescue of the UK and cut a deal – but they have yet to materialise. In reality Germany is more focused on eurozone reform than Brexit. Polls suggest that Germans themselves are shocked and somewhat taken aback by the UK’s decision.Hungary’s government has had its fair share of run-ins with Brussels itself. As a result, it’s probably been the most supportive of the UK, occasionally breaking ranks to say Britain should be cut a good deal.Poland is in a similar situation to Hungary, being the subject of a rule of law investigation by the European Commission. One sign of Poland’s willingness to cross the commission was its foreign minister coming out and suggesting changes to the Northern Irish backstop. He was promptly shot down.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Further votes may take place the following day.However many, including Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, believe Ms May\u0026nbspis planning to delay the meaningul vote until after the European Council meeting on 21 and 22 March, even if an extension to the Article 50 deadline of 29 March\u0026nbspis offered.Labour MP David Lammy said: “It is in those final days that we have the biggest chance to convince MPs to give this decision back to the public.”What will the march be demanding?The key demand is that\u0026nbspany Brexit deal should be put to a public vote for final approval.“Instead of letting Theresa May kick the can down the road until the March 29 deadline, hundreds of thousands of people will march on parliament offering a solution to a crisis that threatens our rights, our living standards and our environment,” said former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas.One proposal for avoiding a no-deal Brexit and securing a second referendum involves tabling\u0026nbspan amendment\u0026nbspin the last week before 29 March.MPs would then approve her deal only if it was subject to a public vote.Where\u0026nbspwill the march take place?The march is set to begin at 12pm, or “high noon”, on Saturday 23 March, on London’s Park Lane.Organisers from the People’s Vote campaign\u0026nbsphave not yet released full details of the route but the march is due to end at Parliament Square with a “mass rally and keynote speeches”.Who will be joining the march?Several leading politicians\u0026nbspincluding Caroline Lucas,\u0026nbspDavid Lammy, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Conservative MP Anna Soubry, and the leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru in Westminster, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, have already confirmed their support.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspis supporting the march and encouraging readers to attend.The organisers are hoping to widen their appeal beyond those who have previously supported the People’s Vote and Final Say campaigns.\u0026nbspThe Independent‘s petition calling on the prime minister to give the people a final say on Brexit has attracted well over 1.1 million sigantures.“The only way forward out of this Brexit mess is through a People’s Vote,” said Sir Vince.For more details about the Put It To The People march\u0026nbsp– and to sign up – please visit\u0026nbsppeoples-vote.ukmarchFor updates on what’s going on with Brexit, you can register here to receive our new Brexit in Brief newsletter and other benefits.

I don’t think anywhere else would warm to that,” he told BBC Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme.Prof Goodwin said Labour’s economic policies were generally popular, as was\u0026nbspthe Tory agenda on immigration. But he suggested there was little pent-up demand for an economically and socially liberal party, as the Independent Group appears to be.“I would argue that actually voters are not in that space, that voters are basically looking for a party that’s a bit left-wing on economics (and) more right-wing on cultural issues,” he said.“That, of course, is not where this new party is aiming for.”While the\u0026nbspcollective’s Tory defectors backed government\u0026nbspausterity measures, former Labour MP Chris Leslie has revealed the group opposes renationalisation and is against increasing the top rate of tax to 50 per cent – policies that polls have\u0026nbspshown to be\u0026nbsprepeatedly\u0026nbsppopular.MPs\u0026nbsp(Getty)Deborah\u0026nbspMattinson, pollster with the Britain Thinks research group, said the election system\u0026nbsp“is stacked against” a big change in the political landscape.“There is a gap, but I would say that in a way the gap isn’t a policy one – it’s a leadership gap,” she said.“People are looking for a different kind of leadership, and actually when we dig down to what people\u0026nbspare really dissatisfied with, it is about the two leaders that are being served up to them at the moment.”Earlier this week a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll found that 14 per cent of the public would vote for the Independent Group if it put up candidates at a general election. A Sky Data poll found 10 per cent of voters willing to back the group, while a\u0026nbspSurvation\u0026nbsppoll put it at\u0026nbsp8 per cent.‘Funny tinge’ proves that the real progressives stand with CorbynAnthony Wells, YouGov’s research director, said his own company’s poll showed the new grouping was “taking support from the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats – though it’s Labour who take the biggest knock”.Leo\u0026nbspBarasi, public opinion expert, said he thought it was too early to tell what kind of support the group might be able to build.Independent Group will back May in any vote of confidence, says AllenChuka Umunna ‘obvious’ candidate to lead new Independent Group“At the moment we’re polling an idea of something, rather than something specific… it feels like these numbers have the potential to change very dramatically, possibly in either direction,” he told the\u0026nbspPolling Matters\u0026nbsppodcast.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has already offered to work with the new group, hinting at a possible electoral pact by saying it would be “foolish” for them to stand candidates against each other.Yet Chris Leslie, one of the original seven MPs who formed the group, said although they would be willing to cooperate with MPs from all parties, “we are not joining the Liberal Democrats”.One of the big issues to be resolved by the breakaway MPs, if it does set up formally as a political party, is settling on a leader.Two of the Conservative defectors, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry,\u0026nbspsaid on Friday that ex-Labour shadow minister Chuka Umunna would be the “obvious” person to lead the group.“You need to establish quite quickly who your leader is going to be, and get your message out there,” Ms Mattinson\u0026nbsptold Today. “The best moment is quite early on when you’ve still got a blank canvas.”Just hours after the launch of the group, which was set up partially in response to accusations of antisemitism in the Labour Party, it was caught up in a row over racist language used by one of its members on live TV.Angela Smith later apologised for referring to ethnic minority people as being “a funny tinge”, claiming she had been “very tired”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We were never a \u0027vassal state of the Soviet Union\u0027.Created with Sketch.

The gaping wounds left by this internal conflict could soon prove fatal to him.There were sharp intakes of breath yesterday when seven moderate Labour MPs announced they have resigned to set up a new Independent Group.Their number may be small — and none of them, except perhaps Chuka Umunna, may be household names — but their move is certain to have a huge impact on British politics.It throws the Opposition into chaos.  Beleaguered by dismal poll ratings, serial incompetence, isions over Brexit and accusations of extremism, Corbyn will now come under brutal pressure.The Gang of Seven’s decision to quit will feed into the narrative that he is a Marxist mediocrity, whose toxic spell at the helm since  has not only dragged his party to the lunatic fringe but has also allowed vicious anti-Semitism and intolerance to flourish.The seven splitters made precisely those charges yesterday, using language that  will be gleefully exploited by Labour’s opponents.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has endured death threats and deselection attempts from socialist zealots, said she would be “sickened and ashamed to remain in the Labour Party” because of the  “culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation”.Equally powerful was Chris Leslie,  the Nottingham East MP, who argued that Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard Left”, peddling “abuse and hatred”.Labour’s turmoil follows the battering that Corbyn received in a new book by investigative journalist Tom Bower.With a wealth of shocking details, it exposes the full scale of the Labour leader’s dreary left-wing fanaticism, his links to anti-Semitism, his anti-British instincts and his low intellectual calibre.As the book graphically demonstrates, never was there any politician less fitted for the premiership.Given the y charge sheet against Corbyn, it is amazing that the party split did not happen earlier. But the moderates hung on in the forlorn hope that Corbyn might change or that Labour might move back towards the centre ground.There was never any chance of that.Corbyn and his dogmatic followers are not interested in compromise or debate — only in enforcement of their warped ideology.  They have turned what was once a broad church into a narrow personality cult.In fact, many Corbynites, like a kind of Trotskyite Taliban, welcome the split because they see it as an opportunity to rid the socialist creed of impurities.“Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the Red Flag flying here,” screeched the infantile Young Labour movement.Yet the charge of cowardice is an absurd one to make at the splitters.It took courage to quit. Most of them had relatively safe Labour seats. Yet they have put their political careers and livelihoods at risk in protest at Corbyn.In addition, they will be forced to endure a barrage of abuse from party members, since Labour is a profoundly tribal movement, where betrayal is regarded as the darkest sin of all.But this will only be the start of a major rebellion against Corbyn.To the Gang of Seven can be added three other moderate former Labour MPs who already sit as Independents, namely Frank Field, Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, who describes Corbyn as “a clear risk to national security”.Public interest in the new group is strong. By early yesterday evening they had gained , followers on Twitter.And more Labour MPs are likely to resign, emboldened by the Gang Of Seven.  It should be remembered that in  no fewer than  Labour MPs —  per cent of the parliamentary party — openly declared their lack of confidence in Corbyn’s leadership.Tellingly, Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, said in a bitter swipe at Corbyn yesterday that he “no longer recognised” his own party and merely condemned the defections as “premature”.Even with its modest beginnings, the Independent Group launch represents the biggest split in British politics since the formation of the SDP in , when Labour was lurching to the Left under Michael Foot. But the parallel with the SDP also highlights the weakness of the new group.The SDP was headed by the big figures of Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, all experienced Cabinet Ministers and potential premiers.There is no one remotely of that stature among the new Independents.Their most high-profile member, Umunna, briefly ran for the Labour leadership in  but withdrew at the first whf of media scrutiny.Nor does the Independent Group have a coherent set of policies beyond being anti-Corbyn and pro-EU.In contrast, the SDP had a clear stance in favour of Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Common Market membership and the market economy.The splitters’ claim to be standing up for democracy is also weakened by their reluctance to accept the result of the  EU referendum, the greatest democratic exercise in British political history. Indeed, in their Remoaner posturing, there is an unpleasant air of the narrow, metropolitan progressive elite about their operation so far.Nevertheless,they help to prevent the election of Corbyn, they will do a service to British politics, just as the SDP helped to halt the advance of Foot almost  years ago. If the new Independent Group is really to reshape the British political landscape, it will have to be far more than just a narrow, elitist breakaway from Labour.A burst of anti-Corbyn hype is not enough. To become an authentic third force that dominates the centre, it will have to attract MPs from other parties.That means taking over the increasingly moribund Lib Dems, now led by the ineffectual Sir Vince Cable.More importantly, it   requires winning over Left-inclined Tories and anti-Brexit MPs such as the noisy Anna Soubry and the former GP Sarah Wollaston.Gaining Conservative support was precisely what the SDP failed to do, ultimately dooming it to failure. Just one Tory MP, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, became a Social Democrat.Gang of Seven member Gavin Shuker said that Labour had “turned its back on the British public”.He is absolutely right — which is  why Corbyn’s mob must not be allowed near power. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT0004700235452.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jane moore jihadi bride shamima begum","story":"Why  Religious indoctrination played its part but undoubtedly, so too did the romantic ideals of a -year-old girl who watched a couple of IS propaganda videos featuring fired-up jihadi fighters and naively flew off to wed one.Within ten days of landing, she was married to Dutch-born Yago Riedijk, then , who’d been brought up in a “lovely” middle-class family in Arnhem before converting to Islam and joining IS.Tellingly, Shamima says he treated her “really well”, that she still loves him, and “I wouldn’t have found someone like him back in the UK.”In other words, in her deluded young head, a convicted terrorist was quite a catch.But fast-forward to now, and by her own admission, -year-old Shamima is “not the same silly little -year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago.”She says that the whole experience — including losing her first two children and seeing a decapitated head in a bin — has “made me tougher, stronger”.And as we know from her unrepentant interviews, she feels she has done nothing wrong, displays a breathtaking sense of entitlement when demanding our sympathy, and, most heinously of all, feels that the Manchester terror attack was “fair justication” for the women and children killed in the Islamic State.So, as the “tougher, stronger” adult she now is, she must be treated as such and left where she is.Revoking her British citizenship, as Home Secretary Sajid Javid did, is a good start.But the letter sent to her parents has made it clear that her family has the right to appeal and all early indications are that they will.But in the meantime, what of her newborn son He’s an innocent and as, by law, his mother — who reportedly has dual Bangladeshi nationality — was still classed as British at the time of his birth, is he entitled to UK citizenship  Or indeed Dutch If so, given that we routinely remove children from homes where their welfare is under serious threat, we should have no qualms in removing a baby from a mother who is wilfully displaying terrorist sympathies, has lost two children already — one to malnutrition — and is currently living in squalor.AndShamima is as concerned about her baby son’s wellbeing as she claims she is, then she should willingly hand him over to either the UK or Dutch authorities for fostering with a family where love, rather than hate, is the norm.MODEL Abbey Clancy says she wanted to throttle husband Peter Crouch after he bought her a phone charger for Christmas.“Can you believe it  I nearly tied it round his neck,” she laughs.As a general “happy we, happy le” rule, all appliances – particularly those related to housework – should be avoided when buying presents.One friend ended a year-long relationship after being given a tray for Christmas.Another took the best part of a year to stop crying at mention of the vacuum cleaner she’d been gted by her husband for her th birthday.“But it’s the deluxe model,” he’d pleaded by way of mitigation.Having said that, after years of buying The Bloke beautul cashmere sweaters that went unworn, I thought, ‘I’ll teach him’, and bought him a £ laminating machine for Christmas.But he genuinely loved it and set about laminating everything in sight.One suspects he’d encase me in plasticI stood still long enough.WHEN the estranged we of Bake Off’s Paul Hollywood bumped into his new girlfriend at a supermarket

dental nurse Greta Friedman for the now famous, impromptu kiss.They had never met before.Luckily for George, it was  and his wholly innocent ­gesture rightly became an iconic image.If he attempted it now, it would no doubt go viral on the nuance-free echo chamber that is social media, accompanied by a #MeToo hashtag and calls for him to be prosecuted for ­sexual assault.RECOGNISE this man  Ooh, hang on, you’re probably thinking...Is it my building society manager  No, wait... Eric Pickles’s younger brother Or... was he Father Christmas at that grotto I took the kids to last year Damn. OK, give up.Unless, of course, you live in the constituency of Ilford South, in which case you’ll hopefully recognise Mike Gapes, the man who’s been your MP for the past  years.But otherwise, therein lies the problem for the new “Independent Group” of seven MPs who have courageously quit Corbyn’s “institutionally anti-Semitic” Labour party – most of us will only recognise two of them, Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger.And until some recognisable big hitters jump ship, they’ll struggle to gain traction with an electorate that – regardless of being left or right wing – currently feels that all politicians blend into one.In the meantime the, er, magnicent seven are in search of a catchy name, and of course, New Labour isn’t an option – not least because they are branding themselves as centrist and hoping to attract disaffected MPs from other parties too.“Central Perk” perhaps  “Middle-earth” “Centre Forward” with Alan Shearer as brand ambassador Suggestions on a sustainable postcard please.Ditto. Same goes for simply slicing out the green bits on a loaf of bread and consuming milk eggs that are out of date but pass the all-important snf test.All of which makes my ­millennial offspring recoil in disgust.Asked where fond jam-maker Jeremy ­Corbyn stands on this isive issue, a s­pokesman says: “He personally never gets to the point of scraping or ­chucking mould.”Yawn.As one wag pointed out, it’s a blatant attempt to appear superior without actually ­settling the issue in question.Much like his position on Brexit.Talking of which, doesn’t the impasse on Brexit merely reflect how reliant the majority of politicians have become on the EU telling them what they can and can’t do And that now they have to make decisions themselves, the leadership skills required to do so are sorely lacking ROLLING Stone Keith Richards says he is ­cleaning up his ­lestyle.“I’ve knocked the hard stuff on the head,” he declares.So what does his tough new health regime involve Er, “a little wine with meals, and a Guinness or a beer or two”, no exercise, as he doesn’t want to ­damage his jointsand a continuing cigarette habit because “I just pick them up and light them without thinking about it”.Bless him.When it comes to clean ­living, he makes Rab C Nesbitt look like Elle Macpherson.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

None of the widespread condemnation of her actions is a patch on the revulsion that comes from the British Muslim community itself.It was bad enough she joined IS as a -year-old but what makes my blood boil is how she repeatedly claims her actions were something to do with Islam.No, they really aren’t.Her support for a murderous cult is nothing to do with the Islam that I recognise.When asked about witnessing beheadings and executions she said she wasn’t bothered because she thought they were “Islamically OK”.No, they are not.This twisted, toxic interpretation of Islam is anathema to me — and it is certainly not something we grew up following as second-generation Muslims in this country.We were taught from a young age that Muslims had to be compassionate towards everyone, whatever their faith.I grew up in a mixed community in Bradford, where I still live.We always took presents to our Christian neighbours at Christmas and ate sweets with our Hindu neighbours at Diwali. We celebrated each other’s religious festivals and had friends from all dferent backgrounds. I always heard about how Islam meant peace and how the Prophet was well known for being kind, honest and gentle.Now, thanks to the actions of Begum and her ilk, people sneer when they hear the phrase “Religion of peace”.The truth is, that in the Koran there are strict rules about warfare. You are not even allowed to harm a tree, so targeting children at a pop concert is completely unthinkable.Still, Begum talks about how “unjust” the decision to boot her out of the UK is and repeatedly asks for sympathy.Sorry, but I reserve my sympathy for the rest of us in the Muslim community.Every single time there is an incident around the world we hold our breath, hoping and praying it was not a misguided “Muslim” behind the attack.Since   there has ALWAYS been a backlash, and it is ordinary, law-abiding Muslims who bear the brunt.According to one anti-racism charity there were more than , attacks on Muslims last year — a rise of  per cent — and women are disproportionately targeted.Women who wear the headscarf say they live in fear. They have been verbally abused, a few have even had their hijabs ripped off their heads — and Begum’s interviews will pour petrol on that fire.High-profile Muslim celebrities such as boxer Amir Khan posted on Twitter that “arrogant” Shamima is giving all Muslims a bad name. It is hard to disagree.The far right will gleefully tar us all with the same brush, using the actions of ONE inidual to paint the WHOLE community as traitors.Despite this, we know that Britain is not as racist as other countries in Europe.When I went to Paris I was told repeatedly that le for immigrants in France is very dficult. Spain and Italy are among other EU nations that continue to show naked hostility and xenophobia towards Muslims, both in the street and among their politicians. Sure, when our parents came here in the s and s they also had to endure dficulties, but a lot has changed since then.Areas such as Bethnal Green, where Begum comes from, is not a ghetto hotbed of radicalism.Muslim men, women and children live harmoniously next to bearded hipsters sucking on their soy lattes, and it is this cosmopolitanism that makes it such a cool place to live.British people are, at heart, compassionate and kind. AndBegum had shown genuine remorse, repentance or humility I am certain the voices crying out for her forgiveness and safewould have been heard.There are still people arguing for her to be given another chance here, saying she was very young when she fled the UK and that she must have been groomed.But she didn’t go to Syria to work for a charity or help on humanitarian grounds. She went for the specic reason of becoming an IS bride, and supporting terror.It is ironic that the person who stripped Shamima Begum of her citizenship is, like her, the child of immigrants.Whatever the legal ramications of her citizenship, for the Muslim community the damage has been done — and sadly THAT can’t be as easily revoked as her passport.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If arrested, their young age means there is little police can do.Constantly monitored by a gang member, they are moved around to avoid detection and given multiple fake identities, while being housed in the most appalling conditions - grotty, over-crowded rooms where they sleep on the floor and food is scarce.They never go to school andthey resist, they are beaten.Police also believe the gang deliberately mutilated some of the children sent to beg and steal to increase their earning potential as disabled children are more likely to evoke pity.For the girls, worse is yet to come as when they reach puberty, they will be forced into prostitution, made to have sex with more than  clients a day in prison-like brothels.These children are modern-day slaves, often sold by their impoverished parents for up to £,, along with the  promise of them having a better le in Britain.According to police, the children are told their families will be at riskthey try to escape, while their relatives are warned their children will be harmedcomplaints are made to the authorities.And nowhere are the profits of these crimes - of money being stolen from Britain through the horror of child exploitation - more visible than on the streets of Tandarei.For most of the , residents of Tandarei, which lies  miles from the capital Bucharest, le is a daily grind of poverty and drudgery.In sharp contrast to the million pound mansions on their doorstep - dubbed the Tandarei palaces - their homes are ramshackle huts without running water and transport is a horse drawn cart along pot-holed roads.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days support after being freed before they are expected to leave the UK and are deported by the Home Office.During this short time, they are given accommodation, financial aid, medical treatment, counselling, a support worker, a translator and legal advice.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a years support to recover.Alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial help and other services.Yet it was this growing wealth which first raised suspicions and led to the joint operation between British, Romanian and European police forces which led to  arrests and and the discovery of  trafficked Roma children during raids in Ilford, Essex, with a possible further , victims.Operation Golf was one of the biggest ever crackdowns on human trafficking, which resulted in  criminals being jailed in Britain -  from the Tandarei network alone.Some of those convicted in Britain include mother and father Speranta, , and Gheorghe, , Mihai, Romas with links to Tandarei, who lived in Slough and took their seven children, aged between two and , begging and stealing across south-east England.They pleaded guilty in July  to child cruelty, benefit and tax fraud and money laundering and were sentenced to two-and-a-half years. Reading Crown Court heard they had swindled £, in benefits.When police raided their home, they found the children, infested with head lice and in urgent need of medical treatment, sleeping on the floor and the fridge empty.One of the youngest had scars from where they had been burned by cigarettes. None were in school.During dawn raids on  fortied properties in Tandarei, officers found a shocking cache of weapons, including AKs, powerful hunting rles, knives, pistols and ammunition, along with gold bullion and enormous bundles of cash containing hundreds of thousands of pounds.There were also hundreds of fake British passports, birth certicates and forged Home Office documents for children, which allowed them to fly their victims to Britain with impunity.In the face of such damning evidence, it is surprising to say the least that the case against them has been dropped, their assets ed - meaning for the poor children of Tandarei, it is business as usual.Retired British Superintendent Bernie Gravett says: “They are proper gangsters. These are not just a few people making a few bob, this is an international organised crime ring - one of the largest.“We recovered hundreds of thousands of British pounds, euros, dollars, Romanian lei, . kilograms of gold, AKs, and all of these guys had huge houses, BMWs and Audis.”Bernie’s role in bringing the case to court was pivotal and resulted in a groundbreaking change in the law after he presented a case to the European Parliament in , which meant children could be classed as being trafficked to beg and steal.Before this, trafficking only applied to sexual exploitation, forced labour and organ harvesting.Today, all his hard work is hanging by a thread and with the evidence pointing towards corruption.“These guys have millions and we knew at the outset this was a risk,” he says.For eight years, the criminal case has dragged on. It was postponed during an astonishing  dferent hearings.Over the years, the first prosecutor was changed at the request of the UK over complaints of lack of co-operation and the second prosecutor chose not to use any of the evidence collected in Britain which showed children found in squalid conditions, their fake passports, bruised faces and countless testimonies of their exploitation.And in a telling sign of how things would turn out, prosecutors downgraded the legal status of the children from ‘victims’ to ‘witnesses’.In the final hearing at Harghita Court on February , the judge, at the request of the prosecutor, changed the charges from trafficking in human beings and transnational organised crime to money laundering.This meant the defendants, who have been on bail other than the first  months following their arrest, were all immediately acquitted because of the statute of limitation for this lesser charge.One of the defendants, leader Constantin Radu, who is in his s and is nicknamed ‘Titi the Burglar’, is estimated to have amassed millions through his criminal enterprise.Incidentally, his son Adrian Radu and daughter-in-law, Claudia, were jailed in England in  for  months and six months respectively in a benefits fraud case that cost the UK taxpayer £,.Romania’s Judicial Inspectorate says it will investigate how this happened, but for now, not one person in Tandarei has faced justice in the Romanian courts.Meanwhile, many of the  child victims are missing.There is mounting anger over what has happened, with a spokesman for the NSPCC saying: “Trafficking is a form of child abuse and these desperately vulnerable children need our help, and perpetrators tracked down and brought to justice.“No child should be subjected to ruthless treatment from such gangs which are organised and do not care about the safety of vulnerable children. It is a vile trade and children need to be protected from these predators.”And this week,  international and Romanian NGOs and human rights groups signed a letter calling for the case to be reopened “to make Romania responsible for its specic obligations under the international conventions against organised crime and human trafficking that it is part of.”The letter, sent to around a dozen organisations including the UN, the Vatican, Parliament and the Council of Europe, is headlined: “Call to action…Organised criminals let off in Romania! Organised crime wins as the Romanian Justice System lets off a network of human traffickers the UK and Romanian police were funded to entrap.”It continues: “The UK authorities estimated that for each exploited child the network’s profit was £, per year. Victims identied in UK were exploited for at least two years, with the youngest being only a few months old.“Based on these facts and many other similar cases that are not effectively handled by the Romanian authorities.”Human trafficking expert Silvia Tabusca, from the European Centre for Legal Education and Research, helped organise the letter with Bernie because of her “shock and disappointment” with the way the case has been handled.“The network is still working, everyone knows it,” she says.“Many of the victims are missing now, we couldn’t identy any of them.“We have a huge amount of evidence from the UK. We have videos, testimonials, we have a lot that was not used by the prosecutor and the court.”She explains how many of the child victims were sent back to Romania with no protection, which meant they changed the statements given to British Police as they no longer felt in a safe position to tell the truth.She adds: “When the victims were repatriated in Romania they had no protection at all, so they were placed back in their families and when the victims were heard again by the prosecutor, they changed their testimonials.“Back in Romania, many of the trafficked children reversed their UK statements, and claimed they were well looked after rather than victims of abuse. Evidence from the UK of empty fridges and poor living conditions suggested neglect.“I’ve never understood why the prosecutor took into consideration the second testimonial of the victims when the British police had a specic procedure to ensure the testimonials taken in the UK can be used in the courts in Romania.”Tragically for the town’s children, the exploitation continues, with Germany being the new favoured destination for trafficked minors, although Britain remains a hot-spot.Meanwhile, Romania is classed as the main country of origin for all trafficked people, according to Europol.Back in Tandarei, town hall inspector Constantin Vladila, says the Roma gypsy gangsters have become very rich thanks to the money they receive from their crimes.“With the money they receive abroad they build these villas,” he says. They show off their Gucci shoes and gold necklaces.”Yet not only are they rich, these are hardened, weaponised and ruthless criminals who are not afraid to use violence to exert their iron grip on the town, which is permeated by a culture of fear.The gangs have people watching, called “lookers” on street corners, making sure everyone keeps in line and during one of the raids on the villas, police found a chair bolted to the floor with ankle and wrist straps, which chillingly shows the fate of anyone who doesn’t.As one Tandarei political insider, who was afraid to be named for fear of his reprisals, says: “The gangs even speak proudly about what theyre doing abroad. Here they have the law in their hands.”On the snow-covered streets of Tandarei, locals keep their heads down and refuse to speak or tell their names when approached. Nor will they answer questions as to what is happening to the town’s children.But with the threat of violence looming almost as large as the monstrous mansions paid for by the proceeds of such evil, it is little wonder why.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction. Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I could just see it.I just broke down in tears. No parent should have to go through this — to have your child murdered.”Alesha’s killing brought her family’s world crashing down last summer.The last photo of her with Alesha was taken just  hours before she headed off to stay with her dad Robert, , and his parents in Rothesay, Bute.Georgina said: “We posed for a snap together on the day before she went away.

I was hysterical and I was told two police officers were on their way.“Usually you see on the TV programmes two police officers chapping the door to break the bad news — but I had to call them up myself. It’s just not meant to happen like that.“When they arrived and said a body had been found, my legs gave way and I fell to the ground.She hailed her “most amazing child” and added: “Alesha could talk the back legs off a donkey.“She had the most infectious laugh and she would stop and chat to everyone.“If she didn’t get what she wanted she would always say, ‘Why ’ She would question everything. We were so alike.”Devoted Georgina — also mum to Courtney, four — now hopes to keep Alesha’s memory alive by setting up an organisation in her name.She added: “I plan at some point to open a charity in respect of Alesha and it will be all voluntary based.“My children have always been my world. I’ve been a stay-at-home mum since I was . My career path could wait. I wanted to raise my children then deal with my wants and needs. I always put them first.“Now I need to continue doing that for Courtney while keeping Alesha’s memory alive.“I want the world to know and remember my beautul wee girl.”Georgina last year told of the special bond she enjoyed with Alesha, who was four weeks premature.She said the tot “changed her le for the better” and gave her the “best six-and-a-half years of her le”.Georgina said: “I never knew what love was until I laid my eyes on the most loving, caring, beautul girl.“Alesha was so smiley and bubbly.

I just can’t believe she’s never coming home.“Her little sister talks about her every day.“The day Alesha went to stay with her dad, they were cuddling on the couch saying they loved each other. That’s a memory I will never forget.”Georgina pledged to “forget the hurt and pain” on what would have been Alesha’s seventh birthday last October .She joined friends and family for a special bubble and balloons party at her girl’s graveside in Coatbridge.She said at the time: “I want people to remember her how she was — and to forget about the hurt and pain. She always wanted a bubble party.

Neighbours of Craig Wood, from Benfleet in Essex, complained to Castle Point Borough Council last summer after the foul stench of dog poo in his garden became too much. Wood was served an abatement notice by the council - which ordered him to clear the poo and ensure any mess did not build up in the future. However Wood ignored the notice - and he was slapped with a pound, fine for the breaches at Basildon Magistrates Court this week. It is understood that Wood - who lives in a block of flats - allowed the dog to foul in his own private garden, despite neighbours complaining about the smell. Despite the fine, the dog mess can still be seen in the garden.   One nearby resident, who asked not to be named, said: I dont live in the block, so have not dealt with it directly, but I have been told and I think a few neighbours were getting frustrated. It cant be nice to see, and we all know dog mess stinks, so youd be very annoyedyou could constantly smell it.

Thats why The Independent Group is polling in third place just  days after it launched. For those fundamentalists who insist dreamland is the best place to stay, its also appealing to blame the TIGgers for an impending lack of unicorns. But TIG is not the answer to our problems. Oh, its great for providing an escape route to all those who like to complain but have no idea what to do. If youre a Corbynista, Brexit headbanger or raging anti-Semite, the appearance of traitors proves all your conspiracy theories true: it was definitely THEIR fault. And for the average voter - the one whos seen a referendum turn to dust while sleep-deprived toddlers bitchslap each other around Westminster like a kindergarten whose teacher has just stepped outside for three years - it looks a lot like the grown-ups have arrived, offering a coherent, mature, alternative to extremist chaos. Its indisputable TIGs appearance was an attention-grabbing thwack of the Parliamentary blackboard. Unfortunately, its  members have not got a Scooby Doo what to do next. They have told the class to shut up and listen. But they dont know what to say.  If you look at the voting records of its members, TIG agrees wholeheartedly with itself that Britain needed austerity as well as spending. It wants to tax the rich more and less, and wants gays to have both more and fewer rights. It wants more private healthcare and to protect the NHS, to lower and raise welfare benefits, and it simultaneously supports and rejects university tuition fees, mass surveillance, and immigration controls. Its only centristyou add all that up and ide it by the Lib Dems. There are just two topics its members seem to agree on - Remaining, and the smoking ban. Thats not enough common ground to stand on for more than  minutes, never mind a -year Parliamentary term. If their unity couldnt survive a conversation in the pub, what can they achieve  Last month a string of crunch votes on Brexit produced majorities of between just  and  votes. The Brady Amendment which threw Theresa May a leline passed with just , putting our  TIGgers in a strong position to sway Brexit. If they combine with the  Lib Dems and  Scots nationalists - never mind potentially hundreds of dissenters in the main parties - they might command a majority to bring down Brexit, the government, or both. So its a damned shame theyve said they wont.  Well, *they* havent - one of the TIGgers, Gavin Shuker, has said he would prop up the government infor a soft Brexit and second referendum. And theres the problem writ large: theyre independent of each other, as well. They have chosen not to pay the pound Electoral Commission fee to register a new party. Theyve instead rented a room above a Spoons and paid pound to register at Companies House as a limited company, which doesnt exactly look like theyre aiming for Downing Street. Chuka Umunna, who is closest to being the leader the TIGgers dont have, says British politics is broken and urged those from other parties to join them. But when put on the spot hes been unable to name a single current Labour policy he disagrees with, or clearly explain what, exactly, TIG wants. The defection press conferences were aimed not at the electorate but their parties - the equivalent of hurling abuse over your shoulder before slamming the door on your way out. None of it, so far, has included an idea about a better or dferent party.  That hasnt stopped anyone referring to the non-party as a party. It hasnt stopped % of the electorate deciding to vote for the non-electable non-party with no policies. Not knowing quite what they stand for hasnt stopped their enemies decrying what they stand for. And the fact they cant agree on how to deal with % of our problems hasnt stopped any of us hoping they can, nevertheless, fix them. They are the first MPs to recognise and reflect the fact that most British people want Labours economic policies - tax the rich, spend on services, regulate the banks - AND a Tory brake on social change - immigration controls, crime crackdowns, and let Shamima Begum rot . The will of the people is clear, and utterly incomprehensible. So you can hardly blame TIG for incoherent babbling, because the rest of us are frankly no better. Chuka calls them a movement, but it doesnt move us any further on and has yet to find the messiah it needs to drive any meaningful change. Instead, the TIGgers have each picked an enemy of reason - Brexit, anti-Semitism, entryism, tribal politics, Jacob Rees-Mogg - and vowed to smash it.  Any tiger with a spring in its tail would get publicity and public support but  of them, winding up the racists and safe-spacers alike, can expect exactly the degree of hero-worship theyre getting. Thats why theyre not a party. And its why they dont want by-elections. Their aim is not to be a government-in-waiting, but to break the extremist grip which is choking the le out of both main parties. It is worth noting that  by-elections would force these MPs to absent themselves from Parliament at just the point that they could wreak the most havoc on Brexit and those shouting loudest for by-elections are very Brexity. But when May and Corbyns puppeteers have their strings cut, Brexit is delayed or trashed and were looking for new leaders in the wasteland on the other side of March , what is right, and what will be left  TIG is not the answer. It is posing a question those on all sides know must be asked - where do we go next   The TIGgers do not know. They just like to bounce - bounce the voters out of despair, the main parties out of entrail-gnawing complacency. They have no plan for what to do next, because one TIGger couldnt agree with himself, never mind  more. They are not your great, centrist, hope. They are  wrecking balls, hoping to clear the decks for something . That something has yet to manest, and the thing that will decide whether it is populist or popular will depend largely what sort of messiah we get. The first of those two options that gets a charismatic and inspiring leader will be the one to turn our heads. Remember: TIGgers dont roar. Enjoy the bouncing, and lets just hope that when the king of the jungle turns up, its Mufasa and not Scar.

Smiley Alesha, who loved watching Peppa Pig and baking cakes, was later found facedown and naked by a member of the public. She had  separate injuries - including catastrophic ones. Campbell, who lived on the island, was yesterday found guilty of her abduction, rape and murder by jurors at Glasgows High Court. And this afternoon, he could be identied for the first time after a judge allowed his name and images of him to be published. Lting a ban on identying the boy, Judge Lord Matthews said: I cant think of a case in recent times that has attracted such revulsion. But who is Campbell and what is his background  Below, we reveal everything we know so far about the monster.  What did Campbell do  Campbell abducted, raped and murdered Alesha, who was staying at the home her dad shared with her grandparents on Bute. The little girl, who was on a three-week summer break, had been put to bed with a Peppa Pig DVD on the night of July , . But the next morning, she was found to have vanished. The High Court later heard Campbell had snatched the girl from the bed where she was sleeping, before inflicting horric injuries on her. He then dumped her body in a woodland area on the island. Alesha was reported missing from her bed at .am on July , with Police Scotland launching a large-scale search to find her. At around am, her naked body was devastatingly found on the grounds of the islands former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel.  A post-mortem found she died from pressure to neck and face. Within days of Aleshas death, Campbell had been arrested and charged. During his trial, the court heard graphic details of Aleshas injuries, with a pathologist saying: Its extremely dficult to give an accurate time of death. When askedthe injuries observed were something he had witnessed before in his years of forensic experience, Dr John Williams replied: No. Yesterday, Lord Matthews told Campbell he had committed some of the wickedest, most evil crimes the High Court had ever heard. Who is Campbell  Campbell was a -year-old cannabis smoker, living on Bute. He had moved to the island with his family as a child, and lived with his mum, dad and younger sister in a traditional stone-built home. He had been born on the mainland, but his family had brought him to the island believing it would give him a secure upbringing. His mum told the Daily Mail: I wanted him to grow up in a safe place, a peaceful environment, and get a good education.  She added that her very normal son was doing an engineering course one day a week and had plans to go to university. Known to pals as a harmless joker with a dark sense of humour, Campbell had started regularly buying cannabis at the age of . He would drink at weekends with friends and had a girlfriend, who is reported to be standing by him despite his brutal crime. He also liked to practice parkour, which involves moving rapidly through areas and jumping from buildings, the Daily Record reports. And he was a fitness fan who enjoyed boxing and lting weights. A video of Campbell, posted on his YouTube channel the year before Aleshas murder, shows him doing carefree flips on a trampoline. He brags he recently went from doing front flip s to front flip .  Had he shown signs of violence  Campbells mum has said he wasnt a violent boy. But reports have claimed he was a “serial killercaught on his first murder” who was obsessed with the horror character Slender Man. He is alleged to have been obsessed with gore and violence. A police source told The Sun: “Slender Man searches were found and it chilled seasoned investigators to the bone. Some of the circumstances between what this character does and what happened to Alesha were carbon copies.” The teenager was filmed playing violent video games, and officers found evidence he had searched online for the Slender Man. In one clip, he can reportedly be heard shouting stab and shank. In another, he yells: That is Slender Man right there.” Slender Man is a fictional character that began le as an Internet meme before growing into something much darker.  He has long arms, which he uses to prey on children, and is portrayed as a black and white image on the periphery of photos. Campbell is also alleged to have nearly drowned a dferent young girl at a leisure centre pool years before Aleshas murder. He was just six or seven when he held the youngsters head under the water for so long she feared she would drown, Bute locals claimed. And the killer is said to have slaughtered and skinned cats in his younger teens, apparently burying two feline corpses in his garden. One neighbour also claimed Campbell had become a local nuisance on Bute and was once caught trying to set fire to buildings. None of the stories, including the near-drowning, have been corroborated, but they have been making the rounds on the island. However, his mum insisted to the Mail: He wasn’t a violent boy. He smoked cannabis, but it’s re among kids on this island.  What did Campbell tell pals  After Alesha vanished, Campbell chipped in with speculation and rumours about what may have happened on a Snapchat group chat. He even sent a video of himself to pals on the group and said: Found the guy whos done it - something a friend thought was a bad joke. The teenager also sent friends a chilling Facebook message saying he might kill one day for the letime experience, his trial heard. The court was told he exchanged messages about killing with a pal. The female friend asked him the chances of getting away with murder with a good plan, to which he said: Wellit was a gd plan then %. She later messaged: Im glad Im not at the top of your hit list. In response, he was alleged to have said: No one is. The witness agreed these were theoretical exchanges where she brought up the subject of murder and at the time caused her no concern. She said they both had a dark sense of humour. And she agreed the conversation was not serious and just rubbish.  What did Campbell claim about the murder  After police were led to Campbell by his own mum, the monster told ious lies about what he did on the night Alesha vanished. Sickeningly, he even tried to blame Mr MacPhails innocent partner, Toni McLachlan, for the crime and claimed hed had an affair with her. On his trials first day, he lodged a special defence of incrimination, naming Ms McLachlan as the person responsible for the killing. However, jurors heard DNA matching Campbell was pretty well all over Aleshas body and clothes, and he had told police a pack of lies. Giving evidence in court himself, the teenager told the jury hed never do something like that in reference to the attack last summer. He claimed that he never met Alesha MacPhail in person. Askedhe brutalised the girl, he said: Its not me, absolutely not. I would never do something like that.  But when jurors were out of the courtroom, he is said to have been spotted smirking. The teenager, described as an adrenaline junkie, also told the court he and Ms McLachlan had met up and had sex early on July . He claimed he did not want to tell police this as he feared it would get back to Mr MacPhail and he would hurt Ms McLachlan. But addressing the jury on Wednesday, advocate depute Iain McSporran QC, prosecuting, said the teenager was telling a pack of lies then [to the police] and a pack of lies in the witness box. During his closing speech, Mr McSporran put it to jurors that they had heard no evidence implicating Ms McLachlan in the crime but a mountain of evidence linking the accused to it. He also said a claim by Campbell - that Ms McLachlan had taken the condom the two allegedly used on July , gone back to the house where she had been staying with her partner, Alesha and the girls grandparents, abducted the schoolgirl, carried her to the woods, smothered her to death and then planted the accuseds semen inside her - was a preposterous story. However, the teenagers defence lawyer, Brian McConnachie QC, urged the jury to acquit his client, questioning why he would abduct, rape and murder the youngster having never met her in his le.  What was he convicted of  Yesterday, justice was finally served as Campbell was unanimously convicted of abduction, rape and murder by jurors. Another charge against him - defeating the ends of justice - had been dropped by the prosecution on the eighth day of proceedings. The killer - who now faces le behind bars - had denied all charges. Aleshas loved ones broke down in tears as the verdict was ed. Campbell will be sentenced next month. Why couldnt Campbell be identied  During his nine-day trial for Aleshas murder, the teenager could not be identied for legal reasons because he is aged under . But he can now be identied after the judge lted the court order following an application from the media, including Reach Plc. The judge said: I intend to grant the application. The press may name the accused and publish images of him.

The six-year-old was abducted, raped and murdered by -year-old Aaron Campbell while she was visiting her grandparents with her father on the Isle of Bute last year. Aleshas mum, Georgina Lochrane, has said she drew strength from the locket she wore around her neck during the nine-day murder trial which culminated with Campbell being found guilty of the heinous crime. Ms Lochrane, , kept the pendant tucked under her blouse in court so evil Campbell - said to have been an avid video gamer and cannabis user obsessed with fictional child abductor the Slender Man - could not set eyes on her daughter.   She told the Scottish Sun: “I never take it off. She’s my le. “I kept it hidden in court because I didn’t want that monster seeing her face ever again. “It has given me the strength to be there every single day to allow her to see justice be served. “The only way she could see that being done was through my eyes.”   Ms Lochrane said she promised her late daughter she would get justice and is happy that she got it. After the killer was named on Friday, Ms Lochrane, who was in court to hear the judges decision, posted a Facebook photo showing smiling Alesha with blue angel wings spread behind her. The happy schoolgirl appeared walking on the clouds above a purple sunset. Campbell, who lived on the same road as Aleshas grandparents, was unmasked after a judge lted a ban on revealing his identity.   A court has heard that the teenage killer has a price on his head. The girl, who lived with her mother and was from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, was abducted from her bed, raped and murdered on July  last year on the Isle of Bute in Scotland. Her body was found dumped in nearby woodland with more than  injuries. Campbell was a fth year Rothesay Academy pupil, who lted weights, played computer games and had his own YouTube channel.   YouTube clips featuring the -year-old show him performing somersaults on a trampoline, saying to the camera: Id like to welcome you guys to the channel. In another he addresses viewers: Yo, its Aaron Campbell here. A nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow heard Campbell drank alcohol, used cannabis, and hosted a party of around  friends at the home he shared with his housekeeper mother earlier on the night he abducted Alesha. CCTV footage from his mothers own security system provided the evidence detectives needed to prove he had left the property on Ardbeg Road in Rothesay at the crucial time.  His mother had contacted police herself, hoping the footage would eliminate her son from the investigation. Campbell was captured coming and going from his home several times in the early hours of July , removing items of clothing and retrieving a torch. He had earlier tried to contact Aleshas father Robert MacPhail and his partner Toni McLachlan, thought to have been seeking to buy cannabis as he had done from Mr MacPhail in the past. Dr Mark Grfiths, a leading psychologist, told the Mirror that violent gaming may have been one of a number of factors in the abduction, rape and murder of Alesha. A jury found Campbell guilty of rape and murder unanimously on Thursday at the High Court in Glasgow. Campbell, who the judge heard has a history of self-harm, anxiety and depression, will be sentenced on March . Lord Matthews warned the teenager, currently being held at Polmont Young Offenders Institute, that he may never be released from custody.

Ambers stepdad Danny Peat told an inquest into her death that she lied when she claimed he subjected her to humiliating punishments in the family home. And in an interview with The Sun - the first since Ambers death - he astonishingly said he has started filming a three-part documentary to put on TV or social media to set the record straight. He claimed he had been branded an evil stepfather and the most hated man in Mansfield, reportedly saying he has become a victim in the case. Amber was found hanged on June , , three days after leaving her home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire She had stormed out of her home after being ordered to clean out a cool box, her inquest has been told.  Speaking to The Sun, Mr Peat said: Because of what people have made up, the finger has always been pointed at me as the evil stepdad who virtually marched Amber out of the house and let her die. It’s disgusting the way I have been portrayed in all this. The documentary is the only way I have to clear my name.  During the inquest, the court has heard allegations Amber was ‘heavily sanctioned’ for ‘undesirable behaviour’ – including being told to wash every pot in the kitchen and being woken at .pm and forced to mop the floors. Ambers stepdad told the inquest that the schoolgirl lied when she claimed he subjected her to humiliating punishments at home. Mr Peat claimed she had made up accounts of the incidents, which were made to teachers at her school – and said he never even ‘raised his voice’ to her. He told the hearing: “I do not like using the word, but yes she did lie.”  Mr Peat, , said the only punishments Amber faced in the home was being asked to wash the pots and having her tablet computer taken off her. While being quizzed by Amber’s biological dad, Adrian Cook – who was allowed to ask questions as an ‘interested party’ in the proceedings - he claimed: “I didn’t think itwas a massive thing. Obviously kids have to have some sort of discipline in place.” Mr Peat now says he wants to get his side of the story out there which he claims he hasnt been able to do, even while giving evidence during the inquest.  He said he will not make anything out of the documentary as he would not want to profit out of Ambers death. Eleven opportunities to save her were missed by social services and other agencies, a coroner found. Laurinda Bower, who recorded a narrative verdict and ruled out suicide, said it is “possible” Amber Peat’s le would not have ended on May , ,she’d received better help. An inquest at Nottingham Coroners Court has heard how Kelly Peat, Ambers mother, waited eight hours before reporting her daughter missing. It is thought by that stage Amber had already died.

In late , after suffering for around  months, Kara ditched her heavy foundation and courageously shared slap-free photos on Instagram, attracting praise and thousands of followers. Kara said: “It is scary to put myself out there, hitting that send button is a big thing. “I used to edit all my photos, but then I stopped and thought, ‘No, you’re putting this out there for a reason – to show your real skin. “On Instagram especially, everything is so flawless and filtered that I knew there was a gap that needed to be filled for people to embrace their insecurities.”   Growing up, Kara never had any problems with her skin. But all that changed around three years ago, when she stopped taking the contraceptive pill. She said: “I believe it was down to the imbalanced hormones in my body. I went to the doctor, and was placed on a dferent type of pill, but all that did was mask my symptoms. “As soon as I stopped taking it, my skin flared up again, even worse than before.”  At first, Kara thought her skin would settle back down once her body adjusted to the hormonal changes. But after around three months, there were no signs of improvement and so she ed to the doctor and was given antibiotics, which had little effect. So, taking to the internet, she began to read up about cystic acne, and became convinced it was what she had. “It was a real knock, confidence-wise,” she said. “I wouldn’t even leave the house without make-up on. I’d cake it on evenI was just popping to the shop. I’d even wear it in the gym, which, looking back, I know is ridiculous.  “Thankfully, nobody ever said anything nasty, but I would get stared at, and I could tell what people were thinking.” Though she initially attempted to treat her acne with topical medication, Kara decided in  to opt for a more natural approach instead. After taking an intolerance test she ordered online, she realised she had been unknowingly eating things that were making her skin worse. So, she overhauled her diet, eliminating dairy and gluten, and cutting right down on sugar.  “At first, I didn’t see an immediate effect, so it was hard to stick to,” she said. “But after around six weeks, my skin started to improve, and so that spurred me on.” Also introducing supplements and vitamins to her daily regime, Kara, who only uses natural, organic products as harsh chemicals can have an adverse affect on her skin, ditched medication for good. Keen to use her experiences to help others, she has set up an Instagram where she shares tips and advice, as well as candid photos of her airbrush-free skin. She explained: “I am also a trained make-up artist, so wanted to start a beauty blog, but give it my own inidual spin so started posting a lot about my skin, and DIY healing.  “The more I shared, the more messages I got, mainly from others in the acne community wanting to knowsomething I was trying had worked. “Now, I have a really loyal following – we’re more like a group of friends.” By speaking out, Kara, who hailed her boyfriend of three years for supporting her, hopes to encourage others to embrace their insecurities and see past the filtered, edited world of Instagram. And, while she admits that she still feels nervous about uploading her bare-faced selfies, she said that banning herself from editing her perceived imperfections has helped her to accept them.  “The only way to build confidence is be true to yourself. If you carry on hiding away or editing a part of yourself, you’ll never accept it,” she said. “I upload my photos for all those people who don’t have the confidence, or feel they can’t among all those flawless Instagram pictures. “I still have peaks and troughs with my skin, but I have learnt not to compare myself to other people.” Speaking of the link between acne and the contraceptive pill, Dr Zenon Andreou, GP at Zava, Europe’s largest online doctor, said: The combined contraceptive pill is sometimes prescribed as a way of treating and controlling acne, as it can stabilise fluctuating hormone levels which can lead to skin inflammation, spots and in some cases, acne. Coming off the combined contraceptive pill can cause changes to your skin and its not uncommon for women to experience an acne flare up. If your skin hasn’t settled down after a month or two of coming off the pill, orthe flare up is extensive, speak to your doctor to find an alternative acne treatment. It’s worth noting that the progesterone only pills and the contraceptive implants can sometimes worsen acne, so do consider this when looking at contraceptive options.

Shocked eyewitnesses watched from the street and nearby flats as Alem Shimeni struggled desperately to claw her way back into the flat. But she plummeted ft to the ground, dying instantly. Minutes later, locals in Glasgow’s Royston apprehended a man as he tried to flee. A witness who lives in an adjacent block took the photograph that captured the -year-old Eritrean’s last moments.He told the Daily Record : “I could hear hysterical screaming and I went to the window and I saw the woman being held by the hair.“She didn’t fall right away, because she was trying desperately to hold on to the window sill and she was scratching at the wall with her feet, trying to get a hold to keep herself from falling. “I thought I should take a photo as evidence but I was really hoping she would be dragged back in by whoever was holding her hair. “As I watched, she fell to the ground.

He said: “I am continually shocked at the hostility and vindictiveness that the most vulnerable people in the world are treated with when they come to this country. “The system is broken and leaves people even more vulnerable.” The eyewitness who took the photo told how he helped to tackle a man as he tried to run away from the scene in Charles Street. He said: “I went running down the stairs, phoning  as I went. “An African guy had come out of block  and had tried to run away. But he fell over a wall and he got grabbed by a concierge and a few women who were there. “He broke away and I ran across and grabbed him and I was helped by a few people. We held him until the police arrived a few minutes later. “There were some women there who were hysterical. They spoke the same language as the guy. “He was chanting and, I think, praying, and he looked out of it. “I have no ideahe was related to the woman in any way or what any of it was about.”   Alem fell to her death on Monday at about .pm.

He said: To be honest at the time I thought it was a good thing. Genuinely, at the time, we had this idea that when youre living in Raqqa getting bombed every five minutes by coalition jets and you see literally, Ive seen children burnt alive.

Letts said the Red Cross has delivered censored letters from his family and they were his only contact to Britain. He told how he travelled to Syria five years ago, first learning Arabic in Jordan before moving on to Kuwait and Iraq. He claimed he lived on the Oxford Street of Raqqa - the de facto capital of the terrorist state - and married an Iraqi woman who has given birth to his son. But he said he has never seen his son and he doesnt know where his we is. Letts, who was arrested on his way to Turkey from Syria, said he misses his mother even though it may sound “toddlerish”.  He also told how he misses pasties and Doctor Who even though it sounds a bit stupid. Asked about Letts situation, a Home Office spokesperson said: In recent days the Home Secretary has clearly stated that his priority is the safety and security of Britain and the people who live here. In order to protect this country, he has the power to deprive someone of their British citizenship where it would not render them stateless. We do not comment on inidual cases, but any decisions to deprive iniduals of their citizenship are based on all available evidence and not taken lightly.  Earlier this month, ISIS bride Shamima Begum, , spoke to reporters from a Kurdish-controlled camp in Syria, saying she wanted toto the UK with her newborn baby. She left Bethnal Green in east London aged , along with two other schoolgirls, to join ISIS self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria in . Britain has revoked her citizenship and her family have written to the Home Secretary asking for his help to bring her days-old son to Britain. The letter to Sajid Javid said the baby boy was a true innocent who should not lose the privilege of being raised in the safety of this country.

Lee Gallagher, from Halewood, in Merseyside was teaching in Spain when started sending obscene pictures and messages on Facebook to a teenager girl called Jessie. But Gallagher, who had created a Facebook account in the name of a fictional Steve Jones, did not know that he was communicating with a fake profile set up by online vigilante group Dark Justice. A selfie, obtained by the Liverpool Echo, shows the teacher standing in what appears to be a school classroom, grinning into the camera. A white board behind him has the words Hi Jessie written on it, along with a love heart. Dark Justice later tipped off the National Crime Agency, and Gallagher was arrested when he flew into Manchester Airport last May.   The Liverpool Echo has now revealed how Gallagher used his role as a teacher to try and groom Jessie. In the messages, Gallagher makes a direct reference to Jessies age, telling her that he also didnt like school when he was younger. He then asks hershes in a relationship before telling her he wants to watch her put on her school unorm, admitting it will be sensual. When Jessie says she would be nervous undressing in front of a man, he tells her: Nothing to be nervous about babe youre beautul and will look amazing naked. Steve Jones : Im a teacher lol.

Jessie: Ill be talking  my friend Samantha. Steve Jones: Thats the first time youve mentioned one of your friends by name. Are you the same age.  Jessie: Haha yeah she is my age. Many of the messages and images Gallagher sent to Jessie are too explcit to be published. Barrister Kate Gaskell, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that Gallagher sent pictures of his penis to Jessie, and asked her to perform a sex act. Gallagher also sent Jessie a video of him performing a sex act. Gallagher, who initiated the contact with Jessie, later pleaded guilty to attempting to cause a female under  to engage in sexual activity, attempting to engage in sexual activity with a child, encouraging a child to watch images of a sexual nature and possessing an indecent image of a child.   Gallagher, who was handed a suspended sentence, concealed his face when he left Liverpool Crown Court. He was ordered to complete  hours of community service and sign the sex offenders register.

Paige, , had enjoyed a diet of fried food, as well as scoffing cheese and chocolate and drinking Malibu and cokes and found the scales had soon crept up to st lb.That meant at ft in she was overweight and Dream, her pony, was getting the brunt, reports the Chronicle Live .And when Paige was told the truth by the animal medic, it really hit home.   Now the -year-old has set herself the task of losing three stones so Dream can be ridden in years to come. And she’s already lost nearly two stone in just three months after joining Slimming World in November. “It was in the summer last year that I was told by the vet that Dream needed a smaller rider or retire, said Paige, of Stanley, County Durham. I was basically too fat to ride my pony.   The vet said because she was carrying my extra weight, and the fact she is  years old, it was probably contributing to her bad back. Dream was given steroid injections and lots of love from Paige. But it was a lighter rider she needed most. “I got Dream when I was  years old, we have such a special bond. She’s my best friend and we do everything together, she added. We have an unbelievable bond, She follows me like a dog, she trusts me.   “I would be heartbrokenI couldn’t ride her again. We’ve been together for  years and I just love her.” Paige joined Slimming World in November and changed her eating habits and started cooking the healthy way. And she’s dropped from a dress size  to a size . Paige, who is studying a degree in children and young people at Newcastle College, said: “I haven’t ridden Dream since October and I said I would start riding her when I lost two stones.   I’m nearly there now and I can’t wait to get back on her. “My goal is to lose three stone and get down to nine-and-a-half stone. I am doing this for the both of us. “We are inseparable so she has given me the incentive.” Paige was given Dream on her th birthday and her pet became her best friend.   “I was cooking everything in oil and buying shop ready-made sauces,” added Paige. “I was eating cheese and chocolate, I have a big sweet tooth. Then at the weekends I was drinking up to  Malibu and cokes. Now that has all stopped. I still eat everything I like but I cook the Slimming World recipes. I still eat my favourite things, but just the healthy way. I still have cheese but less of it and chocolate is in small sizes and just for a treat.

To add to the drama, it’s done as a race against the clock.And McIntyre is gaining a growing reputation for doing the same with top-flight clubs here.Four-and-a-bit years ago he arrived at Ross County with the Highland outfit seemingly already doomed to relegation.By the end of that season he hadn’t just kept the Staggies up, he’d rebuilt them into a squad that would go on and win silverware in the shape of the  League Cup.After the Dark Blues’ weekend win at Livingston got them out of the bottom two for the first time since the end of August, thanks to goals from new handy men Andrew Nelson and Scott Wright, there are strong signs he can do the same at Dens Park.McIntyre’s reign as Dundee boss started in October when he received an SOS from owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms.After a miserable start to the campaign, the Americans’ dream of cementing their team as a force in the Premiership and, eventually, taking the club to a new stadium looked in danger of crumbling around them.Confirmation of just how dire the need for an emergency rebuild came in his first game in charge when the roof fell in during a - defeat at Livi. It showed how flimsy the foundations of the team were as they collapsed under the weight of the home team’s excellence at set-pieces.Almost exactly four months on and after that second visit to the Tony Macaroni Arena under the new boss, the structure looks much more sound.And it’s all thanks to the kind of speedy reconstruction he undertook at County and of which Knowles and his team would be proud. For the team that ran out against Livi at the weekend bore no resemblance to the one McIntyre had to work with when he first headed there.Not one of the players in the starting XI in October were on from the start this time and of the  who were involved on that first day,  have left the club.Only Kenny Miller, Cammy Kerr and Elliott Parish remain and, of those three, veteran Miller was the sole participant in the vital - victory.For McIntyre, to bring about almost a complete change in such a short space of time has been a gamble, one that will only be confirmed as paying offhis team are still in the Premiership come the end of the season.It’s one, though, that represents his best chance of success and it is very much a case of so far so good.While Dundee under him remain a work in progress, the signs of improvement have been there for all to see.Since the end of the winter break there have been two wins, two draws and just one defeat in five league outings.By some margin that’s been the best run of form in the top flight so far this term.If it continues there is every reason to believe that target of building a team good enough for this level by the end of the season will have been achieved.Andthat is the case, fans will be hoping given more time, the manager will be able to set about putting together something even more impressive for next season and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potholes-20000-craters-rack-up-more-than-1m-in-repairs-in-2018","story":"MORE than pound, was paid out to Glasgow drivers for damage caused by potholes last year, new figures show."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-from-bedroom-dj-to-double-brit-winner","story":"CALVIN Harris has undergone quite the transformation, from being a budding DJ recording in his bedroom to becoming a double Brit-winning musician who models on the side."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-comes-together-to-give-west-end-youngster-confident-boost-over-her-new-glasses","story":"A YOUNG girl from Glasgow has won the hearts of the internet this week after the city came together to make her feel less ldquoashamed about her new glasses."},{"url":null,"title":"epilepsy-scotland-des-clarke-among-names-for-fundraiser-comedy-night","story":"EPILEPSY Scotland is warming up ahead of its third annual Patter Merchants Comedy Clash."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-and-snp-clash-over-equal-pay-at-council-budget","story":"A ROW over the decade long equal pay dispute broke out at the City Chambers as the SNP got its budget through"},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-the-referee-took-the-game-away-from-celtic-we-were-the-superior-team-until-the-red-card","story":"BRENDAN Rodgers last night blamed German referee Deniz Aytekin for killing off Celtics hopes of progressing to the last  of the Europa League by sending off Jeremy Toljan against Valencia."},{"url":null,"title":"graeme-mcgarry-whataboutery-is-no-defence-in-scottish-footballs-endless-cycle-of-bigotry","story":"LAST October, after Rangers legend Ian Durrant had been filmed slurring lsquoF*** the Popersquo into a microphone at a private dinner to rapturous applause, I wrote in this column about the rsquo-minute bigotrsquo.

could be a more effective deterrent to Invernessrsquos seagull menace than culling, according to the RSPB.The suggestion comes in response to a call for a limited cull by city businessman Charlie Barbour.Mr Barbour, who owns city centre bars The White House and The Dog House as well as commercial property agency Barbour Commercial, suggests that destroying a small number of nesting pairs would make the centre of Inverness more attractive, safer and quieter.Describing the birds as ldquonoisy, dirty, aggressive and a blight on the city centre, Mr Barbour questions whether the Inverness Business Improvement Districtpolicy of removing eggs each year is enough to permanently reduce the gull population.ldquoWhilst a cull of such birds is not a universally popular decision, I just

Instead, local authorities, businesses and iniduals should tackle the problem by reducing the birdsrsquo food supply by cutting down the amount of edible litter and introducing gull-proof litter bins.Other non-lethal options include putting up physical barriers such as netting on roofs as a deterrent before the breeding season.ldquoWe believe that gull problems in an urban environment are best tackled by reducing the availability of food and nest sites.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray accordion and fiddle club rings in the new year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club got the New Year off to a great start at the Inveraray Inn on January .Supporting players were Fyne Folk, with Sally Hall, Alex John MacLeod, Jake MacKay on fiddles, Agnes Liddell on keyboard and were joined by Calum Satchel on fiddle.

The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

It is the time of Lent: the old Germanic word for spring-time. Our hearts are bidden to imitate the snow-drops: to come up from the darkness, raise themselves into the sunlight, and then fill the world with gladness.Parishioners from Ardrishaig, Christ Church, Lochgilphead and Glassary are joining together this Lent to read a poem a day through the  days of Lent and then Easter week. The poems have been chosen are in a beautul book, entitled The Heart’s Time, by Janet Morley. The poems come from across the English-speaking world, over the last four centuries. One poem is set for each day, accompanied by a short explanation, a reflection, and a brief suggestion for our own thinking.Parishoners will be reading the poems at home for those who wish it there will be meetings to share thoughts and inspiration at Ardrishaig Church during the weeks of Lent and at Christ Church on Sundays. Other meetings could be arranged, formally or informally.You can order the book from Fr Simon Mackenzie by emailing dr.lachlan@zen or calling  , or directly from Argyll Book Centre. Lent begins this year on Ash Wednesday March .Lynx reintroduced to Argyll and ButeFollowing on from an announcement that they were surveying Scotland in late , the Lynx UK Trust have identied three locations which could act as release sites for the medium-sized cats, including the Kintyre peninsula.Independent scientic research has shown that Scotland#s forest could sustain around  of the cats, which ecologists believe could help control the UK#s over-populated deer herds, leading to a regeneration of forest ecosystems that would benefit all of the UK#s native wildle.No lynx attack on a human has ever been recorded anywhere, though lynx reintroduction is a controversial issue with sheep farming unions concerned that the cats would decimate herds, though numerous independent studies make clear that sheep are an exceptionally rare target for lynx, even when the two live side by side.A public drop in consultation is scheduled for Tuesday March  from pm to pm in Tarbert village hall.E.ON donated to Arrochar roof insulationVehicles used by the Arrochar Mountain Rescue Team will benefit from being garaged at a more constant temperature this winter after the E.ON Energising Communities Fund paid for £, worth of insulation to be fitted at the rescue post.The volunteers making up the Arrochar Mountain Rescue Team provide search and rescue assistance throughout Strathclyde when requested by Police Scotland and can be called upon  hours a day,  days a year.  Working across all mountainous terrain and in any weather condition, they use three vehicles which are kept in the garage attached to the mountain rescue post in Arrochar which was built in .After mechanics identied condensation and corrosion as the cause of the vehicles’ increasingly frequent and expensive mechanical and electrical problems, heating was installed at the garage last year to reduce their maintenance costs and improve their reliability. It was then realised that roof insulation was necessary to lower the cost of the heating.Douglas Philp, team secretary for Arrochar Mountain Rescue, said: #As a charity, we’re totally dependent on donations, grants and volunteers.

And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14036524.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swr_ayp_130219hospice2.jpg","title":"ayrshire hospice marks 30th birthday","story":"NewsAyrshire Hospice marks th birthday as staff and volunteers reflect on three decades of serviceThe milestone birthday has been marked with a series of events and celebrations.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor  years it has touched the lives of thousands in Ayrshire and far beyond.

Ironically, BHS has now also gone, and that part of the town must again try to re-invent itself. Joan Kirk, , provides us with a link back to Thomsons’ wonderful shop.  For in  she was Mrs Thomson, and husband Gilbert was the third generation in his family to run the business.

FreshAyr, the team behind the project, are not new to opening ‘pop-up’ spaces in the town. But boss Robert Singer, , insists: “We believe this next phase is potentially our most important. “Ayr has lost its place as a market town and tourist destination. “Long gone are the factories, fisheries and agricultural markets of the past – even retail is failing. “So there is a serious pressing need to rethink the way people engage with High Streets. “Our project will focus on the arts and use it as a force for regeneration.” The team have won a three month ‘proof of cause’ deal which, they hope, will lead in turn to later funding.   Robert explained: “We have a five year project in mind with this unit ideally being our permanent base. “Until now, we have operated around the town on a pop-up basis but that is never ideal. “We’d like this as our home.” The ‘BREAD arts lab’ will launch next month and run in conjunction with the project’s bakehouse, which is set to operate from Cathcart Street.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane february 15 2019","story":"Maths and science teacher and latterly computer programmer, Roger Breckenridge, from Minnesota, USA told the Courier: #As far as I am aware the last Breckenridge to live in Campbeltown, was James Breakenridge who died in .#I have finished my own Breckenridge genealogy and have traced my Breckenridge lineage back to Glencraigs, just a couple of miles north of Campbeltown, along the Tarbert Road.#My ancestors were tenant farmers at Glencraigs, then called Craigs in the early to mid s.#Some of his ancestors are buried at Kilkerran cemetery and he specically knows there are graves for Andrew Breckenridge and his we Janet Finlay.In one posting, on the Courier#s Facebook page, Mr Breckenridge has askedany readers know where the Breckenridge#s rest and whether it would be possible to have photographs emailed.He is also looking for a very old place-name, possibly Glenreavoll,  concerning a Breckenridge family.Mr Breckenridge said: #All I know is that Glenreavoll must have been located somewhere in Scotland but not necessarily in Argyll or Kintyre.#A Breckenridge family lived at Glenreavoll in the year .#I have no idea what Glenreavoll was or where it was located.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Now is the time for the Catholic Church   s own Reformation","story":"For this book Martel has conducted more than , interviews in the Vatican City in Rome, and across the world. He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised.

This hibachi grilledfish turns out to be blandly, unpleasantly gooey in texture and smothered in an indiscriminate sickly sweet, possibly miso, sauce. Absolutely, utterly dreadful. And did I mention pound Being an awkward cantankerous git when faced with relentlessly corporate cheeriness I turn down the teppanyaki rice options and am therefore left with a sticky ball of the plain stuff. A serious mistake.

The newspaper printed a story about it, and Tam was immediately phoned by the local councillor. Explained Tam: \"He just said, Tam, Westminster, your business. Dog s****, mine. and slammed the phone down. I never mentioned it again.\"Flight of fancyA BIT more rough-and-ready than Tam Dalyell was gruff Renfrewshire Labour MP Tommy Graham.

Tommy called his we Joan and asked her to look out the bedroom window ndash they stayed in Linwood ndash to seethe planes were landing.She said they were, which Tommy announced to the crowd.

General Augusto Pinochet, Chilersquos psychopathic dictator, enjoyed dropping his political opponents from helicopters at great height into rivers and sent army death squads around the country to torture and murder thousands of his own people after they had voted for the wrong kind of government in a democratic election. But, hey, he managed to reduce Chilersquos rate of inflation. Mrs Thatcher preferred to dwell on his cuddly side and once described him as ldquothis countryrsquos staunch, true friend. It was a condign lesson from the Iron Lady about the iniquities of rushing to judgment and God bless her for it.Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, often adopted a similarly benevolent attitude when choosing her house-guests. Why, Elizabeth even had old Nicolae Ceausescu and his we for tea at Buckingham Palace even as his private army of government thugs, the Securitate was brutalising tens of thousands of Romanians back home. Royal-friendly historians have since tried to spare Her Majestyrsquos embarrassment with a yarn about her hiding behind a bush to avoid meeting the Romanian dictator but she always seemed happy enough in pictures of them sitting beside each other in that nice, horse-drawn carriage we gted her.One of Britainrsquos closest allies in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia, a gangster state operated by the House of Saud for the sole purpose of enriching itself and its sprawling network of fluffers and lickspittles. This family of oil-anointed cut-throats routinely permits women to be tortured and sexually harassed for displeasing men. Britain itself isnrsquot averse to a bit of mafiosi behaviour in this region and for decades has been dipping its beak in the profits from dealing with the Saudi Corleones. The UK has sold more than poundbn worth of British-manufactured missiles and bombs to the Saudi regime. These are primarily for use in Yemen in an obscene and dirty conflict that has killed thousands of innocents and seen millions displaced as the Saudi-led coalition has targeted civilian areas. Britain has always insisted its dealings with the Saudis are legitimate but was recently forced to reveal that itrsquos been flogging lethal military hardware to them under a shadowy type of licence for the export of ldquoless sensitive goods.ALISON ROWAT:There are victims here, but they are not the IS bridesLast year the UK almost doubled the value of arms sales to countries on the governmentrsquos list of human rights abusers, according to figures compiled by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade . Last week it attempted to pressure Germany to ease its recently imposed arms embargo to the Saudis, arguing that it might undermine the profits of arms manufacturers and adversely affect the European economy. It seems that the spirit of the Opium Wars and the old East India Company continues to influence our foreign policy. Germany elected to halt arms sales to the Saudis on human rights grounds and in the wake of the brutal slaying of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkeyrsquos Saudi Arabia embassy.In this grown-up world we live in though, it doesnrsquot pay to get all censorious about alliances born out of political expediency: anything to keep the peace and oil the wheels of commerce, old chap. Itrsquos just that, well, some politicians and commentators in this country obviously feel that while itrsquos fine for Prime Ministers and the royal family to give succour to international brigands itrsquos a dferent matter when it comes to Shamima Begum, a vulnerable young British citizen who, as a child, made a wrong turning in her le.Ms Begum is the black-clad lsquoIsis bridersquo who has broken cover to inflame the sanctimonious passions of a braying lynch-mob extolling British or Western values. The air is thick with the smoke of their burning crosses. Ms Begum is now  and has given birth to her third child. She departed Britain four years ago to support the Isis Caliphate in Syria but she now wants tohome to England to bring up her child. The English police authorities have already apologised to her parents for failing to warn them that their much-loved daughter could become prey to the sophisticated, online, propaganda techniques of Isis. She was groomed at a vulnerable time in her young le before travelling to Syria to be offered as a sex slave to a man almost double her age and gave birth to two other children. She then watched them die amidst a kaleidoscope of images that no human being, let alone an emotionally immature teenager, should ever witness.The response of lsquocivilisedrsquo and lsquodecentrsquo Britain to her plea to be allowed to come home has been a cruel one.

Its Leaver-turned-Remainer leader Jeremy Corbyn is out of step with half his Shadow Cabinet and most of his party on a Peoplersquos Vote while one senior Scottish Nationalist admitted the SNP was just as ldquomessed up by Brexit, which was bleeding into that other deeply isive issue of independence and when or when not to demand another referendum.I can honestly say nothing, in the  years I have covered the cut and thrust of Parliament, has come anywhere near to Brexit for causing deep isions not even the Iraq war or the Scottish independence referendum or any of the many general elections I have reported on.No , at its twice daily press briefings, faces a barrage of Brexit enquiries from reporters, who joke whenever someone asks a rare non-withdrawal-related question.Attempts to peak through the thick Brexit fog are quickly foiled by spokesmen and women, whose job it is to protect the Prime Ministerrsquos back and ensure the feral beasts of the media know as little as possible about what is really going on assuming, of course, someone somewhere does.Every day, there is a tsunami of Brexit-related stories, which in themselves spawn more comment and so more stories.The Brexit monster has for months bamboozled voters with its endless twists and turns of process accompanied by the never-ending flow of acronyms from CRAG to EFTA and CETA to WAIB.It is, of course, not just the electorate and indeed journalists who have trouble keeping up with the latest developments but ministers too.One anonymous member of the Cabinet, following another interminable session on Brexit before the gimlet eyes of MPs, whispered: ldquoGod, Irsquom bored with Brexit. Canrsquot we just move on and lt this albatross from our neck No doubt, Westminsterrsquos Ancient Mariner was speaking for mostnot all of those whose lives have been benighted by Brexit.And this week, the Brexit monster sank its teeth deeper still with MPs parting company with their parties. The Independent Group has been largely borne of the Remain-Leave isions that have engrained themselves in the Labour and Conservative Parties.And yet for all its ability to confuse and frustrate Brexit is too important to allow ourselves to become burdened or bored by it. How we uncouple ourselves from the  or so year relationship with the EU will affect peoplersquos lives deeply and those of their children and even grandchildren.The isions that have become so entrenched could well take a generation or even two to fully close.But, of course, Britain has not left yet and,some had their way, we would not leave at all.The clock is fast approaching five minutes to midnight and tensions are beginning to seriously fray evidenced this week by the dramatic Labour and Tory splits.In Brussels on Wednesday night, the body language between Mrs May and Jean-Claude Juncker, the gregarious European Commission President, looked awful.Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, told French radio on Friday: ldquoToday, I am more worried than before, warning the chances of an accidental no-deal Brexit were high.Not surprisingly then, Whitehall does not believe the PM will clinch a deal ahead of Wednesdayrsquos crunch Commons vote, meaning the drama will go into March and even into the last week, just days or even hours before the UK leaves at pm on the th.Few,any of her colleagues, know what is actually going on inside the PMrsquos head in this game of political poker.This week, MPs can again expect to vote on amendments calling for an extension of Article  and for a Peoplersquos Vote.On Monday, Cabinet ministers Amber Rudd, Greg Clark, David Gauke and David Mundell went to see their party leader to call on her to put back Brexit Day.The Scottish Secretary believes a no-deal would be disastrous economically and constitutionally.Yet,Mrs May on Wednesday asks her colleagues once again to give her more time, and some ministers say enough is enough and resign, their number will not include Mr Mundell, who, it is thought, will only goand when a no-deal Brexit actually happens.With the Brexit Delivery Group of moderates claiming ldquodozens of Tory MPs will defy their leader next weekshe sets the country on a no-deal course and the European Research Group of Brexiteers demanding fundamental changes to the backstop, the PM is caught between a rock and a hard place.On Sunday, she will be in Egypt for the EU-Arab summit at Sharm-el-Sheikh. The official line is that this is not a European Council and Brexit is not formally on the agenda.But it will be on the PMrsquos agenda indeed, it is the only thing on her agenda.The most important conversations she will have will not be with her Arabian counterparts but with the EU powerbrokers also in the Red Sea resort: Germanyrsquos Angela Merkel and the European Councilrsquos Donald Tusk.Mrs May will be hoping, as the Brexit soap opera reaches its nail-biting climax, the Chancellor and the President will help her snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and finally put a Brexit-wearied nation out of its misery."},{"url":null,"title":"three-cabinet-ministers-signal-they-are-prepared-to-defy-pm-and-help-force-brexit-delay","story":"Amber Rudd, the Work and Pensions Secretary, Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, and David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, have made clear they are ready to openly defy the Prime Ministerthere is no breakthrough on her deal next week.The three Cabinet ministers along with David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, met Mrs May on Monday to talk through their concerns. The Herald understands Mr Mundell will not threaten resignation and would only leave the Governmenta no-deal Brexit actually happened.Writing a joint article in The Daily Mail, the three senior ministers make clear thatthe Tory Brexiteers of the European Research Group[ERG] are able to block a deal, then they will back other MPs to try to force the PM to extend Article  and delay Britainrsquos exit from the EU. This would be against current Government policy.The frontbenchers warn a no-deal outcome would wreck the economy, jeopardise the defence of the realm and risk the break-up of Britain.They stress it is still their hope that the Commons can agree a deal ldquoin the next few days.But they then add: ldquoIf there is no breakthrough in the coming week, the balance of opinion in Parliament is clear: that it would be better to seek to extend Article  and delay our date of departure rather than crash out of the European Union on March .ldquoIt is time that many of our Conservative parliamentary colleagues in the ERG recognised that Parliament will stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit on March . If that happens, they will have no one to blame but themselves for delaying Brexit.On Wednesday, MPs will take part in a crunch vote. Among the tabled options will be to extend Article  to enable the Government more time to agree a deal with Brussels, have a Peoplersquos Vote with the option to remain or pass the PMrsquos deal but then have a confirmatory referendum.Whitehall appears resigned to Mrs May not being able to bring back a fresh deal by Wednesday. She will be in Egypt for an EU-Arab summit on Sunday when she is expected to have talks with Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, and Donald Tusk, the European Council President.But no one is now expecting an imminent breakthrough, thus pushing the process through to March with the prospect of matters going to the wire before exit day on March .However, the trio of ministersrsquo threat means that, to keep her Cabinet intact, the PM will have herself to seek a delay to Brexit, something which she has hitherto strongly opposed.Conservative backbencher Phillip Lee, a leading supporter of the Peoplersquos Vote campaign, said: ldquoFor too long a dangerous game of brinkmanship has been played with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. It is hugely encouraging that Conservative ministers who care deeply about the national interest are now ready to draw a line under this recklessness.\"If a no-deal Brexit is ruled out, we can then have a rational debate about whether the proposed deal is one that meets the promises of the last referendum, is as good as that we already have inside the EU, or offers us the clarity needed to invest and build for the future.ldquoThe time is coming when all MPs will have to decide whether they want to impose that on the British public without asking them first.

Accessible and affordable transport is a leline for many rural residents, connecting people to opportunities for socialising, working, learning and healthcare. The research in Inverurie will seek to understand the needs of the community in a rural Scottish location, including residents and local businesses and see how current transport services are meeting those needs.Findings will be used to develop and design new services that can be trialled in rural areas.Jenny Milne, from JLM said: “This project provides a great opportunity to understand the challenges travelling to, in and around Inverurie. By working with the community, it will help to understand what transport services are needed, and what steps can then be taken to improve existing routes around the town. “The project also hopes to engage the villages around Inverurie.“By using focus groups and asking the local community about their ideas, it will help to shape rural transport to the benefit of those living in the area.”The project also has support from Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon: “I would urge local residents and businesses in the Inverurie area to take part in this project and make their views known.“Many people depend upon public transport in rural areas – to get to work, to socialise or to keep appointments at local GP and dental surgeries.“We are fortunate in Inverurie to have a train station connecting the town with Aberdeen and Inverness and there has recently been major investment in the line. “However, in more remote parts of Aberdeenshire, public transport is less reliable and frequent.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time.

If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

The new software — which can be used on desktops and mobile browsers — allows website visitors to customise what they see and hear, from changing the contrast settings, language, font size and more.In the UK, there are estimated to be . million people with a learning disability and . million people who have English as a second language. ‘Recite Me’ has the ability to translate the NorthLink Ferries website into more than  languages — including Scots Gaelic . It can also translate text-to-speech to help visually impaired users and focus screen areas for those with dyslexia.On Monday, February , teams on board MV Hamnavoe hosted an Access Panel Orkney session, where staff were provided with disability awareness training. During the two-hour session, staff were able to experience what it’s like to have a disability by wearing glasses that simulated blindness, used wheelchairs and crutches and had their hearing dampened.Carolyn Grfiths of Access Panel Orkney said: “The aim of our session was to let staff experience disabilities first-hand so they can empathise with passengers’ needs.#All of us running the training have a disability so we were able to provide first-hand examples of what accessible travel is like for us. We were delighted to be welcomed on board to provide this training and it’s great to see a company like Serco NorthLink Ferries take accessibility for passengers seriously.”The MV Hjaltland will also host a Making Connections workshop today, Friday, February . The workshop will look at how passengers navigate potential barriers when changing from one mode of transport to another. Making Connections brings disabled people together with transport operators to discuss, address and plan how travel connections can be made easier.Seumas Campbell, customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “Catering for passengers with ying degrees of disability is an important part of our service provision. Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs. We pride ourselves on having a great team that always provides the best service so it’s important that we’re constantly refreshing their training.”For more information on accessibility for passengers on NorthLink Ferries, you can visit www.northlinkferries copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those wrecks are still the primary focus of recreational ers, but the remains of the vessels that were mostly recovered and removed from Scapa Flow have also been a recognised ing resource for many years.However, the exact extent and composition of these so-called salvage sites was unknown until this week, when the report of the second phase of work on these sites was published online.The overall aim of the Scapa Flow Salvage Sites Project was to determine what remains of the many vessels of the German High Seas Fleet that were salvaged in the years that followed their scuttling in June .Phase One, undertaken over the winter of  , involved a side scan sonar survey of the main anchorages and other areas thought to have been involved in the salvage process.In the second phase of this project, ers and remotely operated vehicles examined and recorded the remains in detail.The overall result is that the vast majority of salvage sites in Scapa Flow have been located and the remains at each site have been directly investigated and recorded.The full report is now available for public download through the Scapa Flow Historic Wreck website http:www.scapaflowwrecks projects salvage-sites-phase- Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupSaturday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I think I first saw the murals last year and they are quite stunning. Whoever is doing it is obviously very talented. Itrsquos a fascinating site. We know Invergordon became a naval town and was the base for the Home Fleet in World War I. These tanks were built for the supply of fuel to warships and they were in use until the mid-s.Mrs Brown said like many street artists, the person who carried out the work may wish to remain anonymous and even be fearful of prosecution.ldquoI just donrsquot know. But what they have done is quite beautul. I am sure we could find more projects for them in Invergordon including the town house which the community wants to take back into public ownership.A website documenting historical and derelict places in Scotland reveals the depot was built in conjunction with secret oil storage tanks a few miles away.It records the underground tanks were built to hold  million gallons of oil fuel and were built into a solid rock hill to protect it from bombs.On February ,  a Junkers  is reported to have carried out a solo attack on the tank farm, dropping two lb bombs damaging two tanks. But none of the bombs exploded although they cause a major spillage of oil.Mrs Brown said she understood there were plans to remove some tanks to build houses.

With the party, now in danger of being eclipsed by the Independent Group set up this week, questions are mounting over whether the Lib Dems have a future as a distinct political brand.Mr Cable has already offered an electoral pact to the -strong breakaway group, in an echo of the Liberal-SDP alliance that eventually led to the formation of the Liberal Democrats.The Scottish Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine has also backed an alliance, but other party sources have been quoted voicing unhappiness at the prospect of a tie-up.A Lib Dem spokesman said “all our efforts are focused on winning” a People’s Vote. “With no majority for any deal and the two tired old parties ided and hopelessly chasing a unicorn Brexit, Liberal Democrats are confident that this mess can be stopped,” he said.In his speech in Hamilton today, Mr Cable will say the Lib Dems have “much in common” with the Independent Group. “For months, I have been speaking with many of these now independent MPs,” he is expected to say. “We cannot let Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn conspire to run down the clock.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1433384.jpg--.jpg?1549442071000\n","title":"cambridge house schoolfriends collaborate for charity single","story":"A BALLYMENA writer and his singer schoolfriend have teamed up to release a new single, the proceeds of which will be donated to a mental health charity.Daryl Ball and Marc Little both attended Cambridge House and both became involved in the arts in later le - but are now joining forces thanks to a chance encounter with a book.Daryl, who records as a solo artist as well as being a member of the Ballymena band Stripped, explained: An old schoolfriend Marc Little had a book of poetry published in .Its called Out Of Darkness and it was a very personal collection by Marc dealing with dficult yet common subjects like anxiety and depression.I bought a copy last year and really enjoyed his writing style as well as being very moved by the honesty in his poetry. “They inspired me to write a song on subject.I contacted Marc to ask would he mindI used words from two of his poems to create a new song.He was excited by the idea of working together and I agreed to send a rough demo to make sure he was happy with my treatment of it before proceeding.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kfc footage proves man didnt burgle home claim","story":"THE brother of a man who’s been remanded in prison for his alleged involvement in an aggravated burglary in Ligoniel on Friday night says he is innocent.Daniel Lundy says his brother Alan was targeted in an MI-directed operation by the PSNI. He’s currently in Maghaberry. Alan Lundy, of Thornberry Close, appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday charged with intent to steal and having a firearm. He is accused of being one of two masked men who forced their way into a house on the Ligoniel Road on Friday night where a suspected gun was brandished.However, defence solicitor Darragh Mackin said Alan has provided a detailed account of his whereabouts on the night in question, ranging from being in a KFC fast food outlet  miles away from the scene of the crime,then travelling home and accessing WhatsApp and Facebook. Mr Mackin told the court that cell-site analysis and wi account details can be provided to show Lundy was messaging on social media rather than taking part in any burglary and said it was a “fundamental case of mistaken identity”. District Judge Fiona Bagnall refused Mr Lundy bail, citing potential witness interference and he was remanded in custody to appear by video-link on March .Alan’s partner’s house was raided late on Friday where he was arrested in front of his young children.Alan’s brother Daniel told the North Belfast News that he is innocent and his arrest and remand is the latest in a long list of intimidation against his sibling.“Alan is innocent, it is just internment,” he said.“There is sufficient evidence to prove where he was at the time of this so-called incident.“He is constantly stopped and searched and harassed. His family know where he was and everyone knows where he was.“Alan’s partner’s house was searched and has been on numerous occasions with the doors put through and his kids literally dragged from their bed at all hours of the morning. This is nothing but MI-directed.”North Belfast Saoradh representative Dee Fennell says Alan is “a victim of the state”.“Evidence has already been presented to the Magistrates Court when it was alleged he was involved in an incident in Ligoniel that he was  miles away in a fast food outlet and there is CCTV to prove that,” he said. “There is also proof via his phone that he was not there. There were also conflicting witness reports – one said it was Alan wearing a beige coat and the other said it was Marty wearing a black coat.“In any other situation, Alan would be at home with his family and children but instead he was remanded and sent to Maghaberry. This is the second time Alan has been a victim of malicious prosecution and internment.“In , Alan was a steward at a GARC protest and was accused by a PSNI officer of throwing a stone. He was sent to Maghaberry and served three months and it was only then that the PSNI officer retracted the evidence. His family is constantly harassed on a regular basis and, in my view, Alan is a victim of the state.“In the last ten years, Alan has been arrested between  and  times, had his house raided on more occasions than that, stopped and searched hundreds of time.“I am a youth worker. There are four definitions of abuse: physical, psychological, sexual and neglect. No-one can tell me that Alan Lundy’s children being dragged out of their beds in the middle of the night is not psychological abuse of children.“Alan Lundy personies what is happening to republicans across the six counties. It should also be pointed out that Alan has never been convicted of anything under what the British government callthe Terrorism Act.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-14.19.53.png","title":"that battered can is kicked again","story":"IN  the intense focus of many in the policing debates in our community was the lack of progress on legacy matters. It was deeply contentious that a new police service could be established without a wider societal process to deal with the harms of the conflict, especially violations by the RUC, including their involvement in collusion and their involvement in and cover-up of state killings.Many families took the view that policing was needed in the community and that the structures were there to make human rights-compliant day-to-day policing possible, but did not agree with the moves to engage in policing in the absence of a process to deal with the past.We all know that the path of a peace process is painful, the question is, what pain is expected from whom Victims affected by all actors have been asked to accept painful processes. Those affected by non-state actors were asked to accept the early release of prisoners.For victims of the state this was not relevant because those responsible benefited from impunity.While the RUC was disbanded their positive reputation in their own community and wider society was secured with a St George’s Cross presented by the queen of England. The costs of changing the RUC to the PSNI ran into tens of millions with severance packages available to those who served in the RUC who did not want to change to PSNI. Those former officers also received pensions. Some of them also came into the PSNI as “civilian staff”.The thing about all of that was that it was never made clear why the change was necessary. It was alluded to as an issue of “community confidence”, because the RUC had been  per cent Protestant. But, of course, that did not explain the need for a human rights-based approach to the PSNI, for multiple s of accountability, including a Policing Board, a Police Ombudsman’s office and formal community engagement structures.Because we had not had an honest accounting for our conflict and impunity reigns supreme, the crimes of the RUC, which include extensive collusion with loyalism, have gone unmentioned and without proper investigation, with the can of dealing with the past being kicked so repeatedly down the road that it has become a sick joke.When George Hamilton became Chief Constable he made promising and assuring statements about the need for a comprehensive process to deal with the past. However, last year when proposals to do exactly that were published the organisation representing his own rank and file rejected them, because of reputational issues for the RUC.Last week’s focus on files not disclosed to the Ombudsman have led to a wider discussion about policing structures. However, despite international and domestic law being on their side, the very people who have been harmed yet again by these systemic and deliberate failures are those whose concerns, for the best will in the world, were sidelined in favour of wider political “progress”.The question is, will those same families, or any other families, ever see their rights being vindicated in a truly independent process  Is it conceivable that they would once again be asked to compromise in favour of wider processes  The anger we all feel this week should be remembered for those days when those questions are asked."},{"url":null,"title":"labours corbyn a useful idiot for sinn fein author lifts lid on leader","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is also a former journalist with the BBCs flagship Panorama current affairs programme.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Bowersaid Mr Corbyn was \"frightfully partisan\" about Ireland.\"He really wasnt interested in peace, he was only interested in uniting Ireland under a Sinn Fein government,\" he said.\"He was a Communist, and that suited him. He liked struggles against the Establishment. \"Thats why he supported , because they were challenging the capitalist government.\"He never really tried to forge any relationship with Protestants, or even with the Republic.\"He seems never to have had any sympathy for the people who were victims, which I found very odd. I found that very unattractive about him.\"The -page book charts Mr Corbyns political career, including his decades-long support for Irish republicanism and its efforts for a united Ireland. Mr Corbyn has previously faced questions over his meetings with Sinn Fein during the s and s and his views on the republican movement during that period.Among the many Ireland-related issues Mr Corbyn engaged with over his career, Mr Bower pointed to one in particular in his book: how Mr Corbyn reacted when he learned of the Brighton bombing, when the IRA attempted to murder the British Cabinet. Mr Bower wrote: \"The destruction of Britains industrial heartlandsmade Corbyns hatred of Thatcher personal. \"The proof was an early-morning phone call he received on  October  from Val Veness . \"An IRA bomb, she reported, planted at Brightons Grand Hotel, had killed five Conservatives and injured  others, narrowly missing its main target, Margaret Thatcher. \"Corbyn, a man who promoted himself as a compassionate pacist, made absolutely no comment to Veness, either of shock or sympathy. He made no statement welcoming Thatchers emergence from the rubble, or praising her subsequent defiance.\"Just two weeks later Mr Corbyn invited convicted IRA terrorists Linda Quigley and Gerry MacLochlainn into the House of Commons - to the fury of many MPs.Speaking to this newspaper, Mr Bower also suggests that Mr Corbyn was not entirely trusted by his Irish associates.He added: \"The other thing which is quite interesting is that although he was close in the sense that he chaired meetings forMcGuinness and Gerry Adams, they clearly didnt trust him, \"They never told him that while he was chairing meetings or organising support for dead IRA activists, that they were actually negotiating peace with the British Government.\"In their view, he was a useful idiot. They didnt trust him at all. He knew nothing about the negotiations. They just liked that he was available to chair meetings as part of their protests.\"Mr Bower said there was a contradiction at the heart of the MPs political persona. \"There is a pattern of him being a pacist, and always associating with terrorists. Not just in Ireland, but in Central America, South America and the Middle East.\"He has two faces. He is very good at putting on the face of a good bloke. But actually he is quite a ruthless Marxist, who has spent a lot of time now getting rid of the moderate social democrats, which he also did when he was in Haringey. \"Hes not somebody who actually cares for anyone who opposes him. He doesnt tolerate disagreement.\" Mr Bower said Mr Corbyn had copied the ruthlessness of his revolutionary heroes.\"He is a very stubborn Marxist Communist, who actually wants to change Britain into a Communist society, and will brook no opposition to that,\" he said.Mr Bower said Mr Corbyns pacism \"was always a cover\", adding: \"He believes that his enemy should be the pacists, and the people he supports should be allowed to fight and kill for victory.\"Despite his links to Northern Ireland politics, Mr Bower does not believe that Corbyns history is now a liability in UK politics.He added: \"I think that in the election of  the Tories and most like-minded people would have thought it was a great liability. But what they discovered was that amongst people who were under , it was all history. \"He was able to brush it off saying he was struggling to find a peace deal. \"But anyone who knew him knew that he had no interest in peace at all.\"My view now is that he is far more culpable as a Marxist, than over his activities in Ireland.\"Turning to the events this week, when a series of Labour MPs resigned from the party, Mr Bower said the fracture was evidence that at least some at the highest levels of the party have had enough of Mr Corbyns modus operandi.He added: \"What has happened is that this group of socialists, of Labour members who have now left the party, those MPs have recognised exactly what sort of man Corbyn is, and what he represents - and thats why they have finally decided to leave. They dont want to be associated with this hard-line, ruthless, intolerant Marxist.\"Yesterday Mr Corbyn denied there is \"wide scale\" bullying in Labour as another MP quit the party complaining of anti-Semitism within its ranks. Former minister Ian Austin said he was \"ashamed\" of the party.Dangerous Hero: Corbyns Ruthless Plot For Power is published by William Collins ."},{"url":null,"title":"letters shed new light on ira actions in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

July ,  and February , , the correspondence details a gun battle and jailbreak respectively.The first relates to a party of IRA volunteers from the Derry City Battalion being sent to Long Tower Street to protect \"lives and property\" after civilians were shot dead by loyalists assisted by police and Army.\"On Monday morning shooting throughout the city became more general and at least six people killed attempting to get to work, many others were injured,\" the letter reads.As more IRA volunteer units were ordered in, the letter says \"strict orders were given to protect lives of citizens irrespective of religion\".The letter claims the Royal Irish Constabulary , stationed at the Diamond in the city centre, were \"firing into nationalist areas without any justication\".The IRA unit attacked and forced the police into the courthouse on Bishop Street, and two RIC officers were wounded.On the same day the unit took over St Columbs College at Bishop Street, making the building its HQ, as it gave a \"strategic position\", and stayed there for several days as the fighting continued.As the British military strengthened its position throughout the city, and an attack was planned for the college building, the IRA units pulled out.The letter names all IRA officers involved, many from the Bogside, Long Tower, Foyle Street, Bishop Street, Lecky Road, as well as further afield, with officers from America, Omagh, England and Dublin.The letter also says that \"Patrick Laffertys premises were used during this period for storing ammunition\".Other IRA records list \"Paddy Lafferty\" from Bishop Street in the city as a participant in the  rising but it cannot be veriedthis is the same person.The  letter refers to the successful rescue of a comrade from Derry Jail, and names all those involved, including Paddy Lafferty again.The Derry letters are part of the Brigade Activity Reports being launched today by Irish Defence Minister Paul Kehoe and represent the most anticipated file series within the Military Service Pension Collection.In order to administer pension claims under the Military Service Pensions Act, , committees were formed around the country of people who held rank in the IRA structure.These committees were requested to list operations and activities by the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Army during the most active years of the War of Independence .The Referee and Advisory Committee relied heavily on these files to assess personal pension claims.The Military ServicePensions Collectionproject releases the records of the Department of Defence dealing with the service of members of the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, the Hibernian Rles, Cumann na mBan, Na Fianna Eireann and the Irish Republican Army from the period April  to September , .The release of the Brigade Activity files is the seventh release for the MSPC project, marking a new phase in the study of the Irish

At least  people have been killed since December.“Our country is passing through a dficult and complicated phase in our national history,” Mr al-Bashir said in a speech aired live from the presidential palace in Khartoum. “We will get out of it stronger and more united and determined.”In a rare acknowledgement, Mr al-Bashir described the demands of the protesters as “legitimate”, but said there are attempts to exploit the youth protests “to take the country to the unknown”.The state of emergency will give the security forces a free hand in cracking down on protesters and carrying out detentions, and places heavier restrictions on the press and opposition parties.The announcements were instantly met with street demonstrations, demanding the longtime president to step down. Witnesses said riot police fired tear gas and arrested a number of protesters.Sudan has been gripped by nationwide protests since December . The demonstrations, which show no sign of abating, were triggered by rising prices and shortages but quickly turned to calls for Mr al-Bashir to step down.Mr Al-Bashir’s term ends in  and he has repeatedly promised over the years not to make new runs for the presidency. Without amending the constitutions, he cannot run for a third term.His announcement came days after a parliamentary committee tasked with amending the constitution to scrap presidential term limit cancelled its meetings.The Sudanese Professional Association, which is spearheading the country’s demonstrations, warned of any measures that could “turn against” the demands of the Sudanese people, and vowed that it will respond with more escalation in street protests.“The demands of this revolution are crystal clear,” the statement said, “the regime and its head must step down.”However, Mr al-Bashir warned the opposition of the “zero-sum” game that creates chaos, pointing to a wave of the Arab Spring uprisings that led to civil wars in countries like Libya and Yemen."},{"url":null,"title":"cusack calls completion cregganburn lighting","story":"SDLP Councillor for Foyleside has called on the Council to finish the installation of lighting in the local Cregganburn Park between the Glen Road and Rosemount.Cllr Cusack explained that the regeneration of the Cregganburn Park started four years ago in January  with £k funding from what was then the Department for Regional Development, however, it is still incomplete.She commented: \"This budget was to cover many major aspects of the greenway scheme but was insufficient to fully illuminate all the pathways in the area.\"In March last year I was relieved to see Council respond proactively and oversee the lighting of the section from the Baldrick steps to the middle crossroads, which I’d lobbied continuously for.

I would like to see this work completed soon.Cllr Curran said the petition contained the names of concerned parents, community representatives and local residents and hoped the new path can be delivered sooner, rather than later.ldquoParents are keen to see the path provided to increase the safety of children who walk to and from the school. While new speed limits have been introduced in the village, speeding drivers remains a concern, he said.ldquoThe safety of the children who attend the primary school is of paramount importance as indeed is the safety of residents who walk along this particular route.The local politician, who thanked Angela Wills for helping compile the petition, hopes roads officials will act, highlighting the importance of having a safe connection between St Maryrsquos and Chapeltown.Cllr Curran said that while the villagersquos new speed limits were a welcome addition, the provision of the new path must be a priority to help ensure that a busy rural area is safer for all road users.Cllr Enright said community groups around the Dunsford area had joined forces to support the campaign for the new path to connect the school to the nearby church and community centre. He also confirmed that another petition calling for the footpath had secured around  signatures.He continued: ldquoSome progress to deliver the new path was achieved last month with a site visit by roads officials which I organised when school principal Ronan Fitzpatrick and parish priest Fr Gerald McCloskey had the opportunity to walk the route with them.ldquoHopefully this campaign is now on the cards for success. The most recent on-site review with roads officials produced an extra  points for this project bringing it up to .

It is important everyone continues to support traders during this scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17418518.down-memory-lane-who-was-making-the-headlines-in-years-gone-by/resources/images/7205620.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

The budget, in the absence of Stormont, is set by the Secretary of State.

Catholics did not get the vote for another century, and women not for almost another two.In the s only a fraction of men had a vote, and even those who did often lived in boroughs which had so many electors that their vote barely counted, while others lived in ‘rotten boroughs’ where the tiny number of electors ensured disproportionate influence for each vote.But the shape of the current parliamentary system was already in place in the s. There were general elections every few years, and the House of Commons had primacy over the Lords, something it had not had a century earlier until Cromwell shook things up.One thing has not changed over those centuries, however — the first-past-the-postprinciple, in which the person who gets the most votes represents the constituency at Westminster.This applied in th century elections in which one candidate beat another  votes to , or a st century one, in which four candidates all get ,+ votes, one of whom shades the others to victory . FPTP suits a system in which two political parties are dominant. Generally the ultimate make-up of the House of Commons reflects the way the country has voted overall.In America, where the Democratic and Republican parties still dominate, FPTP works OK.But for decades in the UK it has led to unrepresentative outcomes.Labour and the Conservatives do fine, because there are many places where they poll very well and other areas where they poll very badly. They are almost always guaranteed  or so of the  Commons seats.But parties that poll consistently everywhere, but neither well nor badly anywhere, struggle.Ben Lowry: Road ads in Northern Ireland that seek to shock are less effective than the subtle ads in Great Britain that hint at carnage Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"This has long been a problem for Liberals, who often got % or % of the vote but % or % of the seats.The problem has been worsening so that the electoral system is now throwing up massively unjust results. Ukip and the Greens got a combined % share in , five million votes, but only a seat each. In , the Lib Dems got . million votes, almost ten times the DUP’s , votes, but only slightly more seats,  to .You might think these points are obvious. Yet it cannot be that obvious because eight years ago, in , the UK thumpingly rejected reform in a referendum on bringing in a mild form of proportional representationin general elections.I am one of the few people on the political right who supported the Additional Votesystem. There is not enough room in this article to recap on the points we supporters of reform made in , but suffice to say AV, while imperfect, ironed out the worst of the injustices.It also kept the ‘single member’ seat, in which one MP represents one area, like West Belfast or North Antrim. In a true PR system you need multi member constituencies, so that, say, Co Down becomes a single vast seat with four MPs.The intimate link between representative and constituency is lost.Supporters of parties that do well out of FPTP, such as the DUP, tend to support the status quo. But it can work for a party for decades, then destroy it, as it did the Ulster Unionists. For + years they had + MPs until FPTP wiped them out and shut them out of Westminster.PR can lead to permanent coalitions, as mainland Europe shows, but FPTP can cause us to lurch between governments of firm left and right . If we go too far one way, the public corrects the other.Now, in these perilous electoral times which have seen phenomenons such as Trump and Macron sweep aside the established order, we risk disastrous outcomes.If you are a Corbyn fan or a Brexit purist, you might welcome the prospect of a general election in which the movement that you support sweeps the board.But it will ultimately be hugely damaging for parliamentary democracywe do not get election outcomes that broadly reflect the ying ways that people express themselves at the ballot box.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorBen Lowry: NI road ads that shock are less effective than subtle GB ads opening of Parliament: address by peers to George IIJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Ben Lowry: The first-past-the-post electoral system is producing massively unjust outcomes and needs urgent reformOur reproduced old News Letter report yesterday, from  yeas ago, referred to the king#s opening of Parliament in February of .

I am sure that most Christians, particularly Catholics, are sad when they read about sexual abuse perpetrated by people in holy orders an oxymoron combination,ever there was one. As News Letter readers are aware, the Latin Catholic Church, centred in Rome in Italy, is enormous in number and spread. It is in continuous existence since the death of Jesus Christ, some , years ago. I don’t believe the Catholic Church would have lasted so long without ine intervention. The religion started out with a relatively small number of believers, having their human foibles and weaknesses. For instance, Judas Iscariot and Peter and Paul. However, today, there are about . billion Catholics living on the planet and in excess of , men in holy orders to provide them with religious ministry. It must, a priori, be very dficult, humanly speaking, to manage such a vast and complex world-wide organisation clearly, from time to time,not all the time, serious spring cleaning from top to bottom is necessary. The summit is, one hopes, such a cauterisation.I will conclude by comparing the measured approach, referred to above, taken by the News Letter today and a Dublin newspaper. The Dublin newspaper has a sensational headline, “Priest forced woman to have abortions.” Coming from this Dublin newspaper, this is hypocritical the same newspaper, in my opinion, looks favourably on abortion provision.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos done damage to Britainrsquos standing in Egypt.ldquoItrsquos quite hard to see now ndash given all the improvements that have taken place ndash what the justication for it still being there really is.Carol MacKenzie, head of customer welfare at travel firm Thomas Cook Group, said: ldquoThis ban does not extend to the resort area. However, as long as the flight ban remains in place, the resort is, in effect, closed for British tourists.ldquoWhen the advice changes and we can build it into our holiday programme, we look forward to flying customers from the UK to Sharm again so they can enjoy all the resort has to offer.In August , Mrs May welcomed Egyptrsquos efforts to improve security at the airport in a phone conversation with the countryrsquos president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.An account of the call released by Downing Street gave no indication the Prime Minister was ready to ease Government advice, saying only that the UK would continue ldquoworking closely with Cairo on the issue.A Government spokeswoman said: ldquoThe security of British nationals is our top priority. The UK took the decision to suspend flights from Sharm el-Sheikh in November  following theJet attack to protect the travelling public.ldquoWhile the Government has not yet concluded that it is right to lt the restrictions, we continue to work closely with the Egyptian authorities on aviation security and regularly review our decision.ldquoWe look forward to achieving theof flights when the situation allows..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: PM urged to reconsider Sharm flight ban article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.PSNI warn of children staggering about drunk or choking on their own vomit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
