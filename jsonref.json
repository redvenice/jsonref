Yet the room had a deathly chill about it. The clock had stopped and the ashes in the grate were cold. A poem about the incident, written in 1912 by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, describes an untouched meal on the table — there was cold meat, pickles and potatoes. A kitchen chair lay on its side, and the only sign of life was the keepers’ canary, half-starving on its perch.It is not known if this was accurate, but what Moore saw clearly terrified him. Tearing back down to the landing stage, he pleaded with the crew from the Hesperus to help him search the tiny island. They found nothing.Reluctantly, Moore agreed to stay to tend the light. It’s not difficult to imagine how scary the nights that followed were for him, alone in the light room, listening to the wind howling all around as the revolving lamp cast shadows. The Northern Lighthouse Board’s superintendent, Robert Muirhead, arrived three days later to investigate and described Moore as being in a state of ‘nervousness’.He may have heard voices on the wind, calling out the names of the three missing men — a claim later made by others.While keeper Thomas Marshall was single, the other two — James Ducat and Donald MacArthur — were married, with six children between them. The task of breaking the news to their widows had fallen to Muirhead, who knew their families well.         Actors Gerard Butler, Peter Mullan and Connor Swindells star as the three men who mysteriously vanished from the Eilean Mor lighthouse in the Flannan Isles in 1900He had last seen the keepers on December 7, when he travelled out for a routine check on his employees. ‘I have the melancholy recollection that I was the last person to shake hands with them and bid them adieu,’ he wrote.The last record left by the men was on the morning of December 15, chalked on the slate where they noted down weather conditions and their daily activities, which included trimming the lighthouse lamp, filling its oil fountains and cleaning the giant lenses.Nothing amiss was mentioned, but the fact that the lighthouse had not been operational that evening strongly implied that this was the day they disappeared.As to the cause, Muirhead noted that the landing platform on the western side of the island had suffered severe storm damage, with twisted iron railings and a block of stone, estimated to weigh a ton, displaced onto the path. He concluded that the men must have gone to repair the damage and been swept away by a wave.The problem with this theory is that, while the boots, capes and oilskins belonging to Ducat and Marshall were missing, Donald MacArthur’s were still inside. It seems unlikely that, in the freezing weather, he would have left the lighthouse wearing only shirt-sleeves and rope-soled sandals.It was possible, of course, that Ducat and Marshall had run into trouble at the landing stage and that, on hearing their cries for help, MacArthur had rushed down to their assistance before being washed away himself.But if he had left the lighthouse in a panic, why had he wasted precious time on closing both the entrance door and the gate to the yard? And why were none of their bodies ever washed up?None of it made sense and, over the coming years, speculation mounted about the keepers’ fate. Among the more fanciful explanations was a claim by locals that the keepers had been changed into those three giant birds Moore had seen upon landing.Others said they had been kidnapped by a foreign power after seeing something they shouldn’t have — perhaps a secret warship? Or did one of them murder the other two — MacArthur was said to have a volatile temper —and throw himself off the cliffs in an act of remorse?Or was American author Vincent Hayes Gaddis — who specialised in sensational stories of the paranormal —correct in suggesting that in the days before the trio vanished they had been tormented by a tempest so violent that it must have been caused by a supernatural dark force?In a book written in 1965, Gaddis quoted entries supposedly written in the lighthouse log by Thomas Marshall. ‘Never seen such a storm,’ he is recorded as writing on December 12. ‘Ducat quiet. MacArthur crying.’ He added the next day: ‘Storm continued through night. Grey daylight. Me, Ducat and MacArthur prayed.’It has since been suggested that Gaddis might have fabricated these entries. But we simply don’t know, as the original logbook went missing after the incident.That in itself might be regarded as suspicious. Was this document of official record really mislaid, or was it deliberately destroyed?If the distressing entries quoted by Gaddis were authentic, it certainly wouldn’t have helped the authorities to recruit other keepers to Eilean Mor, replacing not just the three men who disappeared but also Moore. He lasted just three more months before demanding a transfer from the post.The island is now home to an automated lighthouse that continues to illuminate a safe passage for seafarers. But, to this day, it has failed to shine a light on the fate of its keepers, whose existence was simply erased on that fateful day over a century ago.The Vanishing is now out in UK cinemas."},{"url":null,"title":"Fred Britains oldest goldfish floats mortal coil aged 44","story":"Share this article The couple, from Worcester, contacted newspapers years ago to correct reports that said Britain’s oldest goldfish was a 38-year-old named Splash.George, pictured, and Fred – who died two years ago aged 42 – lived through two house moves and the birth of the couple’s daughter Emma.They are buried together in the back garden. "},{"url":null,"title":"Easyjet passengers left stranded airport five hours flight went without them","story":"Share this article A spokesman from easyJet told Surrey Live: \u0027easyJet can confirm that flight EJU8717 from London Gatwick to Lisbon on 12 April erted to Porto due to the runway closure at Lisbon.\u0027Once in Porto the flight was subject to a slot constraint and so the decision was taken to disembark passengers for their comfort.         \u0027The slot delay unfortunately caused crew to exceed their legal working hours limit so passengers were provided with refreshment vouchers and offered coach transfers to Lisbon.\u0027After customers had disembarked a slot became available and so the flight operated an empty sector to Lisbon to ensure it could operate later sectors.\u0027Although this is outside of easyJet\u0027s control, we would like to apologise to passengers for the inconvenience caused and thank them for their patience.\u0027The safety of its passengers and crew is easyJet\u0027s highest priority.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Scientists reveal best way stack odds favour property auction","story":"Share this article          Taking a couple of friends to auctions to throw off other bidders may be the way to securing the house of your dreams (stock image)\u0027One thing I know to be true is the more bidders, the faster it gets to an owner\u0027s price,\u0027 Mr Ilicic said. Ultimately, he said, no strategy will ever top a person\u0027s budget.He went on to say the best tip he could offer people heading to auction is to change up their bidding tactics.Mr Ilicic said varying the amounts in each bid - some small and some large - is a way to keep everybody on their toes while bidding.Auction hack backed by science could demotivate other bidders - realestate.com.au"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3860237.1555255099!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unsafe levels of lead found in drinking water across country","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn most cases the contamination is the result of older lead pipes still in use across the public water network.Tests have found lead concentrations nearly 15 times over the legal limit in north Dublin drinking water, and unsafe levels elsewhere across the country.Since the start of 2017 unsafe levels of lead have been found in drinking water in more than 30 areas, according to figures from Irish Water obtained by The .A test of drinking water near Sutton Dart station, north Co Dublin, found lead contamination nearly 15 times above the legal limit last year.In a test by local authority staff in parts of Coolock, north Dublin, lead concentrations 12 times above the legal limit were identified.In most cases the contamination is the result of older lead pipes still in use across the public water network.HSE guidelines state that long-term exposure to lead can affect brain development in children, or babies in the womb. It can also cause harm to kidneys and high blood pressure, and is classed as a probable carcinogen.Where local authority audits of water quality find lead concentrations over the legal limit of 10mg per litre (mgl), the council notifies Irish Water. The water utility then follows up with affected properties, along with the Environmental Protection Agency and Health Service Executive (HSE).Nine areasOne test in Kilkeedy, Co Clare last year found lead levels more than 10 times above safe drinking limits, at 113 mgl.A test of drinking water at a property in Rosses Point, Co Sligo, found levels six times higher than the limit for safe consumption late last year.Unsafe levels were also found at properties in Kilmacthomas, Co Waterford, in Gorey, Co Wexford, in Carrickbeg, Carrick On Suir, and at Screggan, Co Offaly.Irish Water figures on harmful lead concentrations were released following a request under the Freedom of Information act.Dublin City Council figures for 2016 show levels of lead above legal limits were found in a further nine areas, including properties in Beaumont, Drumcondra, Phibsborough, Cabra, Terenure and Sandymount.Domestic water charges were suspended in 2016, before being effectively scrapped by the Government, following a large anti-austerity protest movement. Irish Water has been embroiled in controversy from its inception, over significant spending on consultancy fees and bonuses.Leakage reductionIn a statement, Irish Water said there were no lead water mains in Ireland, “however there are still some lead pipes remaining in the public network”, such as pipes connecting mains to homes.“As part of Irish Water’s leakage reduction programme, we are removing all remaining lead pipes from the public water network and replacing them with plastic pipes,” a spokeswoman for the utility said.Irish Water has been conducting a trial with Dublin City Council to apply a lining to lead pipes to reduce the risk of lead eroding into the water system. The pilot has been limited to a small number of houses in the council’s social housing stock.“Indications are that properties generally showed a reduction in lead levels after the lining was completed,” a spokeswoman for Irish Water said. Plans to roll the scheme out in Dublin are under discussion."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3860126.1555274973!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"delaney s future in doubt as fai board meets over governance issues","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFAI executive vice-president John Delaney giving evidence during his appearance at the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. Videograb: Oireachtas TVPA WireThe FAI has said it is taking urgent steps to address its governance and financial issues while the future of its former chief executive John Delaney remains in doubt.In a statement released on Sunday evening, the FAI board said it would meet again on Monday to review its response to the controversy that began with the revelation last month that Mr Delaney gave the association a €100,000 loan in 2017 to prevent it exceeding a €1.5 million bank overdraft. This loan was subsequently repaid.Mr Delaney has insisted he acted in the best interests of the game when he loaned the money to remedy a short-term cash flow problem.The association said it planned a root-and-branch review of its rules and processes. It also said it was engaging with Sport Ireland on the composition of a new governance committee with additional independent members.The statement added: “The association continues to work to restore the trust of its stakeholders including the Minister and Sport Ireland as soon as possible. The FAI wants to ensure that all those who play football across Ireland do not suffer as a result of the actions of the association.”The association also said it would respond to questions raised by the Oireachtas committee for sport by close of business on Monday.Mr Delaney, who took up the role of executive vice-president with the FAI last month after stepping down as chief executive, was not mentioned in the statement.Further pressure was placed on Mr Delaney by news reports about his expenses on Sunday.Minister for Sport Shane Ross said he had “ongoing concerns relating to corporate governance at the FAI and the circumstances surrounding a financial transaction”. Mr Ross said the need for transparency and good corporate governance was paramount and confirmed that “sports capital funding will only be granted to national governing bodies who are in good standing and who have strong corporate governance.” Fine Gael TD Fergus O’Dowd, who chairs the Oireachtas committee on transport, tourism and sport said he was “deeply concerned” about reports in relation to Mr Delaney’s expenses.“I want to see a forensic audit of all of the accounting activities of the FAI and I believe the Minister and Sport Ireland should insist on that,” he said. John O’Regan, secretary of the Kerry District League told The , Mr Delaney had texted him on Saturday to say he would be stepping down from the FAI board, but would continue his role with Uefa. The FAI has declined to comment on this. The organisation has hired financial firm Grant Thornton to investigate how the loan came about, despite three members of the board knowing about the loan when it was paid.The controversial €100,000 payment, which has raised questions about the FAI’s governance arrangements, was not flagged to Sport Ireland, the State body that oversees the public funding of sporting organisations in the country.Sport Ireland has temporarily withheld further funding to the FAI pending an auditor’s investigation.ReviewOn Thursday, The Professional Footballers Association Ireland called for a complete overhaul of the organisation after reviewing the board’s behaviour in the Irish parliament.A statement from the Management Committee of the PFAI condemned the board as “rotten”.On Sunday, the Sunday Times reported on details of Mr Delaney’s spending on his work credit card in the last six months of 2016, while he was on a salary of €360,000 as chief executive. There are also reports that other FAI board members are also set to step aside from their posts over the coming weeks. Cathal Dervan, the FAI director of communications said there was no board meeting at headquarters at Abbotstown on Saturday. The ongoing controversy led to protests at a number of League of Ireland matches on Friday night. Well-placed sources said several members of the FAI board are now wavering in their support of Mr Delaney. There are, however, significant concerns that if Mr Delaney was to leave his post, Ireland’s influence at Uefa, the European governing body for soccer, could also be diminished at a time when the association is pursuing a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup alongside the English, Welsh and Scottish football associations. Mr Delaney is a member of Uefa’s executive until 2021, having been elected in 2017. The terms of his departure from the FAI would also have to be addressed.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday questions “need to be answered” by the FAI and Mr Delaney over the €100,000 loan.Speaking after a week in which Mr Delaney refused to answer questions at an Oireachtas committee about the loan citing legal advice, Mr Varadkar said: “I don’t think anyone would be satisfied by it”.“The public, taxpayers, football fans would have like those questions to be answered.”Mr Varadkar added Mr Delaney had been under no obligation to answer questions at the Oireachtas committee.“The truth is that he was within his legal rights not to answer those questions. He is not a public servant and therefore is not accountable to the Oireachtas,” he said.“However, the FAI is accountable to the Office of the Director for Corporate Enforcement and is accountable to Sport Ireland for the money they get.”Elsewhere, sources said that they doubted sponsors would abandon the FAI immediately, despite several issuing statements on the controversy this week. One source close to a current FAI sponsor said it was likely brands would adopt a “wait and see” attitude, adding that it was “not the role of a sponsor to decide what the next part of the process should be”.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3860096.1555272426!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"timetable of john delaney loan controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA screengrab taken from Oireachtas TV of FAI executive vice-president John Delaney before the Joint Committee on Sport.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Britain would have a “meaningful” say in future European trade deals if it chooses to enter a customs union with the EU, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Mr Varadkar told The  that the UK, as the fifth-largest economy in the world, should have a say in any trade deals.The argument against a customs union from many in Westminster has been that the UK would not have any say in trade deals struck between the EU and other trading blocs.Mr Varadkar last week first floated the prospect of a new-style customs union between the EU and Britain.His comments were seized upon by UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is pushing for such a policy in his talks with British prime minister Theresa May as they attempt to reach a cross-party solution to Brexit.The Taoiseach said a new customs union would be a “win-win for the EU and UK”.“And we’d be stronger together in dealing with the US, China and Japan.”Mr Varadkar said: “There seems be significant support for the UK forming a customs union with the EU after Brexit. It is of course up to them to decide if that’s what they want and to ask for it.‘Favourable response’“But if they do, I think they’d get a favourable response from the European Union. It would make elements of the backstop superfluous and would mean tariff and quota-free trade with Britain for our farmers and agrifood sector. Our biggest market for food.“Given their size, I think they’d have to have some meaningful say about future trade deals and the rules of trade. At the same time, it would only work if we had a level playing field in terms of environmental and produce standards and workers’ rights so we aren’t undercut. It’s very much the kind of thing we’d be open to talking about, but before that is possible legally under article 50, they have to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement,” he said.Separately, former taoiseach Bertie Ahern and former British labour prime minister Tony Blair have jointly called for a second confirmatory referendum on Brexit.‘Churn and reflection’“Understand that the public are undergoing the same process of churn and reflection as the politicians, and give them permission to be honest about that,” they wrote.They said it was time to “elevate the discussion above inidual interests to the collective”.“It is also time to be brutally honest about the real choices and the real consequences of those choices.“Brexit, particularly a no-deal Brexit with the risk of a hard border, is both the most serious threat to the Belfast Agreement since it was created, and to the union in our lifetime,” they wrote.“It is precisely because of such issues as the Border that there should be a confirmatory vote on whatever now emerges from the Brexit process in parliament.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jonathan BradyPA Wire Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing calls from his own party and the SNP to explicitly commit to another referendum on Brexit. Richard Corbett, Labour’s leader in the European Parliament, warned that voters could desert the party in the EU election unless it committed to a public vote.He told the Observer: “If Labour does not re-confirm its support for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal in its manifesto, then it will haemorrhage votes to parties who do have a clear message. If, on the other hand, we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot, we could do very well.”Former Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett echoed his calls, saying a “lack of clarity” could cost the party not only in the EU election, but in the next general election too.She told the paper: “It is very important that there is a clear message about where Labour stands and what Labour is offering. In my view that clear and simple message should be that there should be a confirmatory vote of the British people.”The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said Mr Corbyn must stop wasting time and that it would be “unforgivable” for Labour to avoid another referendum on EU membership. Mr Blackford warned against pushing through a Brexit deal that ends freedom of movement and removes single market access.Earlier this week the EU granted a further extension to article 50 and the UK is now set to depart on October 31st.Mr Blackford said: “Talks have been ongoing between both the Tory government and Labour Party for over a week but not a single compromise has been tabled.“Instead of wasting more time, Labour must make clear to the Tories that the answer to the Brexit deadlock is to put the decision back to the people.“It is no secret that the Labour leader has ducked and ed on the issue of a second EU referendum, but at this crucial crossroads it is high time Jeremy Corbyn commits to putting a second referendum on the table as the only way forward.”Red linesMr Corbyn has insisted that UK prime minister Theresa May must compromise on her Brexit red lines if cross-party talks on EU withdrawal are to succeed.The Labour leader said it was “scandalous” the prime minister did not seek dialogue with Labour on Brexit earlier.Mr Corbyn said Mrs May should not use the delay of Brexit until October 31st as a chance to put her withdrawal agreement to the Commons again.Referring to the talks between the government and Labour, Mr Corbyn said: “It’s scandalous that it came so late in the Brexit process, not at the 11th hour, not even at five to midnight, but at five past midnight after she missed her own deadline of the 29th of March.“And I have to say, it is a challenge to negotiate with a government that’s collapsing – when you can’t be sure if commitments made by the prime minister will survive the week and when cabinet collective responsibility has given way to collective irresponsibility, with ministers contradicting each other on the airwaves.”Tory leadershipFormer Conservative leader Iain Duncan-Smith has called on Mrs May to stand down as soon as next month as he called the party’s failure to leave the EU on time “a disaster”.Mr Duncan-Smith said polling on the party was concerning and blamed the delay to Brexit.A poll by Opinium put Labour seven points ahead of the Tories. The survey shows Labour climbing one point to 36 per cent, while the Conservatives have dropped six points in two weeks to stand at 29 per cent.Ukip are up two points to 11 per cent on the survey, and the Liberal Democrats have dropped one point to 8 per cent. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photographer: Elijah NouvelageBloombergPete Buttigieg officially launched his run for the White House on Sunday, against a backdrop of surging poll numbers and increasing national interest. The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, the fourth-largest city in Indiana, made the announcement at an afternoon rally in his hometown.Mr Buttigieg said he was running “to tell a different story than ‘Make America Great Again’. Because there’s a myth being sold – the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back.“The problem is that they’re telling us to look for greatness in all the wrong places. As South Bend has shown, there is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the word ‘again’. It is time to walk away from the politics of the past and towards something totally different.”‘Proud son of South Bend’“They call me mayor Pete. I’m a proud son of South Bend, Indiana, and I am running for president of the United States. ”Mr Buttigieg said he was part of the first generation to grow up with school shootings and to expect to live with the fallout from climate change - “Climate security” is “a life-and-death issue for our generation”.Mr Buttigieg outlined a campaign he said would spotlight the themes of freedom, security and democracy.We live in a moment that compels us each to act. The forces changing our country today are tectonic“I recognise the audacity of doing this as a midwestern millennial mayor,” he said. “More than a little bold – But we live in a moment that compels us each to act. The forces changing our country today are tectonic.“This time, it’s not just about winning an election. It’s about winning an era. It’s not just about the next four years, it’s about preparing our country for a better life in 2030, in 2040. And in 2054 when, god willing, I get to be the same age as our current president.”“The horror show in Washington is mesmerising, it’s all-consuming,” Mr Buttigieg said. “But starting today, we’re going to change the channel.”Saying “politics is personal”, Mr Buttigieg listed ways from healthcare to spousal visitation rights for same-sex couples that connect legislation in Washington to life across the country. His prescription for change included electoral reform, “healthcare for every American”, racial justice, women’s equality and organised labour.“It will take courage to move on from our past,” he said. “We’re not going back.”As he concluded, Buttigieg was engulfed in cheers which swelled to the first chords of his playoff song, Creedence Clearwater Revival’s Up Around the Bend.Earlier, a big day for the openly gay Rhodes scholar Afghanistan veteran broke with a new website, peteforamerica, a New York magazine cover - headline, “Wonder Boy” - and an interview with the tabloid website TMZ in which he revealed a love for “classic rock” like Creedence and was duly given a guitar.“Mayor Pete didn’t disappoint,” TMZ said, “as he started riffin’ Hey Joe by Hendrix!”Mr Buttigieg was also asked what he would do if he made it to a campaign against Trump in which homophobia became a factor.“I’m kind of used to that by now,” Mr Buttigieg said. “I’m from Indiana, I’m gay as a – I don’t know, think of something really gay, that’s how gay I am. So I’m used to bullying. I think you confront it initially and then you move on.“When he lies or does something wrong you confront that and then you change the channel, change the subject back to you.”He also name-checked his two dogs, Buddy and Truman.Since forming an exploratory committee, Mr Buttigieg has published a well-received memoir, toured TV studios and early voting states and performed impressively as a fundraiser, sailing past the number of donors needed to make the debates.Some observers have counselled caution, pointing out that third-place polling in Iowa and New Hampshire - behind Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden but ahead of Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Beto O’Rourke - means little a year away from the primary.Progressive prioritiesOn Saturday CNN published a report headlined: “Pete Buttigieg pushed an aggressive plan to revitalize South Bend. Not everyone felt its benefits.”Also up for debate is whether Buttigieg’s mix of a strong personal story, charismatically expressed progressive priorities and faith-based appeal to middle America may prove too good - or lightweight - to be true.On Sunday, Mr Buttigieg told the New York Times he was “focused on the interaction of ‘narrative and politics’ and how parties connect with people beyond policy decrees”.Dan Glickman, a secretary of agriculture under Bill Clinton who taught at Harvard when Mr Buttigieg was there, told the Times the mayor had a “way of articulating a vision which is progressive but not off-putting”.George Lakoff, a Berkeley linguist, said: “He knows how to talk plainly. Usually, Democrats are saying: What are your 10 most important policy areas? He doesn’t do that.”In the days before his launch, Mr Buttigieg’s expression of support for Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota congresswoman targeted by Trump for her remarks about 911, was feverishly parsed and debated.“The president today made America smaller,” Mr Buttigieg wrote. “It is not enough to condemn him we must model something better.”His speech on Sunday was meant to begin that process, to present a young president - he would be the youngest ever, at 39 - who might bridge a deepening political ide.Earlier this month, he cited James Joyce’s most famous novel, Ulysses, as one of his favourite books in an interview with the pop-culture website Vulture. Mr Buttigieg described Ulysses as the greatest work of modern English literature: “It’s known for being complex and difficult, but in a way it’s very democratic: a story about what it is to be human as one middle-class guy goes about one day of his life in Dublin.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/13/TELEMMGLPICT000194068109_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7GgL7o0_ESnuLxJzSWOePQE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"petting zoos breeding grounds potentially lethal bugs","story":"A little girl holds a rabbit at a petting zooPetting zoos are becoming breeding grounds for potentially lethal bugs, tests have shown as parents are warned their children could be at risk from drug-resistant E. coli.A study of eight attractions found that more than one in ten animals were carrying strains of “highly virulent” bacteria against which standard antibiotics are useless.Petting zoos and show farms attract more than 12 million visitors a year in the UK and are hugely popular with parents and teachers as a means of educating young children.However, keepers were warned to improve hygiene on the sites in order to protect children in the face of the growing threat from antimicrobial-resistance (AMR).Decades of profligate use of...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

Allen died in October 2018 while suffering from non-Hodgkins\u0027 lymphoma, just months after the plane\u0027s development was unveiled.We all know Paul would have been proud to witness today’s historic achievement, said Jody Allen, Chair of Vulcan Inc and Trustee of the Paul G. Allen Trust. The aircraft is a remarkable engineering achievement and we congratulate everyone involved.Please review our commenting policyRadical environmentalists group bids to bring central London to standstill with road block protestsLine of Duty, episode 3, review: Who knows where this convoluted plot will go next?Comment: Why I\u0026#39m standing for the Brexit PartyComment: Only a proper Brexit can spare us from this toxic polarisationComment: What can happen what a Pope kisses your feet?Doctor John Snow and the truth behind the Victorian cholera epidemicHouse prices are soaring because homeowners are \u0026#39bored of Brexit\u0026#39 and want to get on with their livesLandlords will no longer be able to evict tenants at short notice under plans for \u0026#39open-ended tenancies\u0026#39End of plastic rings as Guinness joins Carlsberg in getting rid of packaging that strangles birds and fish\u0026#39White male titans\u0026#39 of classical music are putting young people off the art form, Royal Albert Hall director claimsSajid Javid declares no-one should be \u0026#34left behind\u0026#34 as he pitches for Tory leadershipSocial media firms barred from using \u0026#39addictive\u0026#39 features to keep children online in new legal codeChaperones could take pupils to school as police study finds way of predicting likely locations of knife murdersMinisters must intervene to prevent \u0026#39rip off\u0026#39 petrol prices ahead of Easter getaway, AA saysLine of Duty, series 5 episode 3 recap: what the H is going on with Hastings and Corbett?Shamima Begum hires Gareth Peirce, the human rights lawyer who represented Abu QatadaPhilip Hammond ridicules Brexiteer leadership candidates for forming \u0026#39suicide pacts\u0026#39 during last contestAssange tried to create a \u0026#39centre for spying\u0026#39 inside the Ecuadorian embassy, says nation\u0026#39s presidentRoyal wedding death threat revealed: Court hears chilling message warning day would be \u0026#39a blast\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000194013330_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqx1rGucoo2J_ExhuM2sOt-5Dg7ACGJPdPR4xgCzbOV8A.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"can happen pope kisses feet","story":"Pope Francis kneels to kiss the feet of South Sudan opposition leader as South Sudan\u0026#39s President Salva Kiir Mayardit looks on during a meeting at the Pope\u0026#39s Santa Marta residence in the Vatican. It was moving to watch Pope Francis kiss the feet (or, to be absolutely accurate, the shoes) of the warring leaders of South Sudan last week.

prices soaring homeowners bored brexit want get lives","story":"The average asking price on a home jumped by nearly £3,500 in April House prices are soaring because homeowners are bored of Brexit and want to get on with their lives, a new report says.The average asking price on a home jumped by nearly £3,500 in April - marking the biggest month-on-month uplift in over a year - according to Rightmove property website.It said across Britain, the average price of new-to-the-market properties increased by an average of 1.1  per cent - the biggest month-on-month increase since March 2018.Estate agents said that bored of Brexit home buyers and sellers cannot keep putting their lives on hold and want to get on with moving.The average asking price on a home is now £305,449 - which is still 0.1 per cent lower than a year ago despite the spring bounce in April.Rightmove said it is usual to see prices increase at this time of year, but this is still the biggest increase seen for the month of April since 2016.But it said the uncertain political backdrop continues to hold back the market, with new seller asking prices, the number of properties coming to market and the number of sales agreed all below this time last year.Chart: Average UK house price over the past 25 yearsMiles Shipside, Rightmove director, said: The rise in new seller asking prices reflects growing activity as the market builds momentum, egged on by the arrival of Easter.He added: They are often second-steppers out-growing their first property and it gets harder to postpone a move with growing children.They may have already delayed for a year or two waiting for Brexit clarity, and understandably their patience is wearing thin.Mr Shipside said the Brexit extension could also now give hesitating home movers encouragement that there is now a window of relative certainty in uncertain times.Please review our commenting policyRadical environmentalists group bids to bring central London

But it has had to warn that even with all that it may never make money.\u0026nbspUber’s story is much bigger and more complex than that of rival Lyft, which blazed a trail for it\u0026nbspwhen it joined a Nasdaq, only for the road to turn bumpy when investors started to take stock of what they’d bought.\u0026nbspBoth companies cut their teeth with the business of matching drivers, working as independent contractors, with customers. They have revolutionised\u0026nbspthe personal transportation market in the process.\u0026nbspBut Uber’s vision goes way beyond that.\u0026nbspComparing the two is like putting a carton of plain vanilla ice cream (Lyft) up against a\u0026nbspBen \u0026amp Jerrys Cookie Dough S’wich.\u0026nbspUber has ambitions in freight, meal deliveries, logistics. It’s pouring money into self driving cars, despite the project’s early difficulties.\u0026nbspCEO Dara Khosrowshahi sought to whet the appetite of investors by telling them that the company is “barely scratching the surface” when it comes to these industries.\u0026nbspCome ride our wave because it may reach tidal proportions,\u0026nbsplining us up with the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon, was the message to potential backers. The latter is a company Uber is particularly fond of comparing itself to.\u0026nbspTrouble is investors are being asked\u0026nbspto start their\u0026nbspsurfs from the middle of the Atlantic in stormy waters, far stormier than any Amazon faced at the same stage. It\u0027s true that Uber has shaken up its governance model, and says it’s addressing a problematic workplace culture that resulted in a series of disturbing allegations of sexual harassment and misogyny. It’s revved\u0026nbspup its\u0026nbspboard, sidelined founder Travis Kalanick (who still stands to make billions from the float) and boldly stated that\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Uber always does the right thing, period.\u0026nbspThe trouble is many of its drivers would beg to differ. At the leading edge of the gig economy, it is fighting legal battles on multiple fronts. Some of the early exchanges have not gone well. A case over drivers’ employment rights in the UK is heading for the Supreme Court after the Appeal Court said they were entitled to them. And it\u0026nbspisn’t just in this country where the issue is being hotly debated in the legal arena.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Chief executive Elon Musk has long touted the standard Model 3 as a watershed for the\u0026nbspelectric car industry\u0026nbspthat will bring the technology to the mass market.But the company has struggled to figure out a way to sell it at that price and actually makes a profit.Customers who want the $35,000 Model 3 cans till get one but they will have to go into a Tesla showroom or make the purchase over the phone.The latest announcement is the fourth round of changes to Tesla’s pricing and retail strategy, which has appeared increasingly erratic.\u0026nbspMr Musk’s company had said it would shut almost all of its showrooms to focus on online sales before an about turn just 10 days later in which it said most locations would stay open but prices would rise.Created with Sketch.

As part of the changes,customers will be able to lease a Tesla for the first time but with a big caveat: they don’t get the option of buying the car once their lease is up.Why? Because Tesla wants to use them in its planned ride-hailing network which it hopes will take on the likes of Uber and Lyft.All Tesla vehicles now come with the Autopilot driver-assistance system as standard, the company said in a blog post.\u0026nbspThe Model 3 with Standard Plus battery range used to cost $37,500, plus $3,000 for Autopilot. It now costs $39,500 with Autopilot included.The company launched its long-awaited $35,000 version of the car in February to great fanfare. Now the least expensive version available to order online is the Standard Range Plus Model 3 at $39,000.Last week, Tesla reported its biggest ever drop in vehicle sales. The electric car maker revealed the first quarter of 2019 saw 31 per cent less deliveries than the previous quarter, representing a fall of nearly 30,000 vehicles.It is the first time in nearly two years that Tesla has experienced a quarter-to-quarter sales decline but still represents a significant increase from the first quarter of 2018.Tesla\u0027s Model 3 proved to be the firm\u0027s most popular car in the first three months of the year Tesla, representing 50,900 sales. The remainder of sales were made up of Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Uber\u0026nbspsaid it expects operating expenses to “increase significantly in the foreseeable future” as it continues its expansion.\u0026nbspIn a filing with US regulators that revealed its financial health for the first time, Uber also said that its rapid growth has recently slowed.The company had 91 million\u0026nbspaverage monthly users across its platforms, including food-delivery app Uber Eats at the end of 2018 but growth slowed to 33.8 per cent from 51 per cent a year earlier.Those users generated sales of $11.3bn last year, 42 per cent higher than in 2017.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a letter: “Over the past 18 months, we have improved our governance and board oversight built a stronger and more cohesive management team and made the changes necessary to ensure our company culture rewards teamwork and encourages employees to commit for the long term.”Uber has come up against increasing resistance from local taxi operators and regulators around the world, and faced a number of scandals and legal hurdles that have the potential to drag on its future growth.In the UK it has been locked in a legal fight over whether its drivers should be classified as workers employed by the company or self-employed people who are not entitled to rights such as holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber drivers protest on the first day of Uber’s Court of Appeal caseUber’s blockbuster listing on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to raise about $10bn to help fund further expansion.Its closest rival, Lyft, listed its shares at the end of March but has seen its valuation crash 15 per cent since then, suggesting investors’ appetite for risky, loss-making technology firms may be drying up.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And in some cases, parents have had to give up their careers to care for children during the day.Laura Berrill is still waiting for her son, who has Asperger’s, to start in a specialist college after spending nearly two years at home. His mental health has declined out of school.“He got very skinny. He refused to wash and brush his teeth. He stopped talking. It was heartbreaking. It would make anyone depressed, let alone someone on the spectrum,” she said.Dozens of new schools for children with special educational needsThe number of children with an education healthcare plan, a legal document setting out a\u0026nbspchild’s needs, has risen from 240,000 to 320,000 since 2015 – a rise of a third, according to the NEU. \u0026nbspBut the funding for the high needs block, the budget reserved to fund such additional provision, has only increased by 6 per cent over the same period, from £5.6bn to £6bn, the union says.The report comes as hundreds of delegates of the NEU annual conference will debate whether to orchestrate a national campaign to oppose cuts in educational provision in Liverpool on Tuesday.\u0026nbspKevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, warned that many local councils have been left “on the brink” amid funding cuts for SEND provision.He said: “This is an appalling way to be addressing the education of some of our most vulnerable children and young people and is causing untold misery and worry for thousands of families.”Mr Courtney added: “It is\u0026nbspleading to very bad consequences for children where special needs support is being cut in schools and local authorities, and we hear stories of children that are out of the system for years at a time sometimes.”Angela Rayner MP, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “The Tories’ cuts to education have disproportionately hit children with special educational needs. It is devastating that, as a result, some of the most vulnerable children are being forced out of school altogether.”\u0026nbspAnntoinette Bramble, chair of Local Government Association’s Children and Young People Board, said councils were reaching a point where the money is not there to keep up with demand, pushing support for children with SEND “to a tipping point”.The LGA is calling on the government to use the forthcoming spending review to “plug the estimated special needs funding gap facing councils of up to £1.6bn by 2021.”Nadhim Zahawi, minister for children and families, said: “We have increased spending on high needs from £5bn in 2013 to £6.3bn\u0026nbspthis year and it is not right to imply funding has been cut.\u0026nbsp“We recognise the challenges facing local authorities and in December provided an extra £250m up to 2020 to help them manage high needs cost pressures.“We have also provided councils with an extra £100m funding to create more SEND places in mainstream schools, colleges and special schools.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionChristopher Hepworth with partner Tanisha Prince (right) on their way to victory in the annual UK Wife Carrying Race at The Nower in Dorking, SurreyPolice officers search near the scene on St Neot\u0027s Road in Harold Hill, east London following the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old girl on Friday night.

They’ve adapted to change before. They must do so againClick to followThe IndependentIf we are to move on from the current toxic politics, the Tories must lead the way, both in tone and contentThe Parliamentary Conservative Party notoriously has two default settings: complacency or panic.The pressure of the Brexit process has moved the dial significantly towards the latter, although one should never underestimate the capacity of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership skills to encourage Conservatives into the former.For anyone who thinks long-term, though, the departure of colleagues with stinging remarks about destroying the Conservative Party should be worrying. Almost the worst thing about the early days of the Independent Group was that the Labour defectors were clearly distraught about leaving their political home, while the Tory defectors looked exultant.Is this the beginning of the end?I strongly believe that it need not be, and indeed will not be as long as the post-Brexit Conservative Party pours as much energy into its domestic policies and widening its base as it has into European affairs.Created with Sketch.Both sides of Brexit: Remain and Leave through a lens Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Remain protesters with pro-EU banners sit next to a Leave campaigner in Trafalgar square during the People’s Vote march in London.

In the late 1990s it looked as though Conservatives were destined for extinction in Scotland and Wales. The party now has significant representation in both countries, allowing it once again to become the truly national UK-wide party it has always been.Also over the last decade the party in parliament has begun to look much more like modern Britain in all its variety. It seems overwhelmingly likely that, just as the Conservatives were the first party to elect a woman leader, it will be the first party to elect one from a Bame background. Of course there is much more to do but the party has recognised the problem of looking and sounding too narrow and is taking effective steps to address it.Conservatives would be ‘wiped out’ in snap general election – Tory MPBefore I seem to sink back into the mode of complacency I should acknowledge that real problems exist. The membership of the party is not even representative of Conservative voters, let alone the wider country. It is much smaller than it used to be. It is possible to exaggerate how much older the Conservative Party membership is than Labour’s, but it is still true that some 44 per cent of Conservative members are over 65, compared with 30 per cent for other parties.There is also a whiff of intolerance in the air inside the party which is new and dangerous. Deselection is a word which in the past has only been associated with the unpleasant actions of the hard left of the Labour Party. If it becomes a habitual threat from the hard right of the Tory party it will signify a move away from being a party of government. It should be stamped out immediately.But to address any of these long-term issues requires progress on Brexit, and then a move on to other matters. We all know that the Brexit vote represented a myriad of discontents, some of them shared across the west since 2008, and some specific to this country. What the Conservative Party needs to do is address the various sources of discontent.Ashdown and Lord Kinnock (PA)This is more difficult than previously. In 2005, after our third election defeat in a row, I gave the Macmillan Lecture for the Tory Reform Group and observed that: “If the Conservative Party does not like modern Britain it is unlikely that modern Britain will warm to the Conservative Party.”Much of that problem was solved by David Cameron and his modernisation programme. The current leadership faces the even more intractable problem that modern Britain no longer seems to like itself. The tone of political discourse ranges from the harsh to the disgraceful. Violent language is common. Disgracefully, and occasionally tragically, this spills over into physical violence.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersIf we are to move on from the current toxic politics the Conservative Party in its post-Brexit phase needs to lead the way, both in tone and content. The tone required is one of respect not just for each other and our varying views but for our political opponents as well. This is not easy.The current Labour Party is determined to establish a false and unpleasant narrative: that the (necessary) period of austerity after 2008 means that every inidual Conservative politician is complicit in creating poverty and misery and is therefore beyond the pale. It is very tempting to respond in kind, but this temptation should be resisted.Raising the debate from the gutter is the right thing to do and will in the long run benefit those who do it, as long as the underlying discontents are addressed at the same time.Long ago\u0026nbspRab\u0026nbspButler said he was keen to make it ‘perfectly possible to be literate, rational, well-informed and a Tory’. Today we should be equally keen to make it perfectly possible to be decent, compassionate, outward-looking and a ToryInevitably, after the financial crash of 2008 and subsequent global recession, there are no lack of problems requiring a hard-headed but warm-hearted solution, in the best tradition of One-Nation Conservativism. As we move out of the austerity period we have the chance to provide a mixture of targeted increases in public spending and tax cuts which will provide future prosperity both for the country and the party.That chance will only come if there is a successful Brexit settlement which releases the large amount of stalled investment that has been waiting for certainty but if and when this happens, the opportunities are huge.In politics and economics maths is everything. If your economy grows at 2.5 per cent a year, you can afford to increase public spending, cut taxes, and have some left over to reduce long-term debt. If it grows at 1.5 per cent a year, which would probably be our fate if Brexit goes wrong, you don’t have enough flexibility.Although sorting Brexit is therefore the first and overwhelming priority, the choices the party makes about where it concentrates next are key.This is not the place for detailed policy blueprints, but the areas for activity are pretty clear. We need to meet the needs of those parts of the country which did not benefit from the finance-driven globalisation of the 1990s. The Northern Powerhouse was a good idea and needs to be made a reality. Coastal towns, and more generally medium-sized towns with no nearby big city, have special needs.Created with Sketch.

The different social positions of the interaction are exaggerated by the visual dimensions, with passer-by almost always standing above, leaning over, talking downAway from the geographical concentrations of disadvantage which the government should address, the national challenges are equally clear.The first tentative steps towards a revival of home ownership have been taken, but this ought to be much higher in the political mix. The unfairly neglected Industrial Strategy needs to be at the heart of what the government both does and talks about between now and 2022. If we get right our policy towards artificial intelligence, 5G, electric vehicles, and other new technology, then the effects of Brexit will be relatively small. The same is of course true on the downside.If it is to meet present\u0026nbspchallenges, the party will need to retain, or in some cases regain, its sense of optimism. It is all too easy for Conservatives to become grumpy pessimists. That way lies irrelevanceThis is not to neglect the traditional areas of policy dispute. Just as health now has a growing budget and a proper long-term plan, I would like to see education treated in the same way. By education I don’t just mean school and universities, but also the FE and apprenticeship sectors, which deserve more attention than ever before.In social policy, I think grasping the nettle on social care funding should be the start of a much deeper process of rethinking our attitude to the over-60s to recognise the fact that people commonly live to be 90 or older and are fitter and healthier than ever before into their 70s. We should stop assuming that everyone over the age of 65 is frail and just wants a quiet life. Staying in the world of work is not just better for the economy, it is usually better for the inidual.There is no shortage of challenges, and happily no shortage of thinking about them. Both my colleagues in parliament, and centre-right thinktanks new and old, are fertile in creating policy ideas. For the country’s sake, these ideas need a successful political party to make them real. Far from being defunct, the Conservative Party is needed as much as ever to shape Britain in the post-Brexit world.Tory Party being ‘hollowed out’ by ex-Ukip members, John Major sayIf it is to meet this challenge, it will need to retain, or in some cases regain, its sense of optimism. It is all too easy for Conservatives to become grumpy pessimists. That way lies irrelevance. It also needs to regain the mantle of the party that offers opportunity to all.Millennials have been foisted with an unfair reputation as entitled snowflakes. They are having to cope with a fast-changing world of work which offers less security than their parents enjoyed, and a significantly more difficult route to settled prosperity in their own home. Most of them want that, and the political prize for offering it is huge.These substantive policy areas will be much more likely to win first-time voters than any improvement to campaigning techniques on social media, necessary though they are.At the same time, leading Conservatives need to take every chance to show that being a Conservative does not in some way mark you out from the rest of the country. Corbyn’s Labour Party is determined to pursue this idea, and it needs refuting. Long ago Rab Butler said he was keen to make it “perfectly possible to be literate, rational, well-informed and a Tory”. Today we should be equally keen to make it perfectly possible to be decent, compassionate, outward-looking and a Tory.These various policy suggestions involve recasting some traditional Conservative values, including opportunity for all, home ownership and support for business, to make them fit for the mid-21st century.This will allow the party to follow one of the wise points made by another Tory guru, Keith Joseph, in the 1970s, when he said that instead of the centre ground, politicians should seek the common ground. It is a subtle but important difference, in that it means that instead of triangulating between the existing extremes, you identify new areas of concern which the people may have reached before the politicians.The Brexit vote showed that there was indeed a disconnect between political conventional wisdom and the desires of the British people. Throughout its history the Conservative Party has been sensitive to such changes, and adept at adapting to them.It needs to do so again.Damian Green has been the Conservative MP for Ashford since 1997 and was the first secretary of state and minister for the Cabinet Office from June to December 2017Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief executive Elon Musk has long touted the standard Model 3 as a watershed for the\u0026nbspelectric car industry\u0026nbspthat will bring the technology to the mass market.But the company has struggled to figure out a way to sell it at that price and actually makes a profit.Customers who want the $35,000 Model 3 cans till get one but they will have to go into a Tesla showroom or make the purchase over the phone.The latest announcement is the fourth round of changes to Tesla’s pricing and retail strategy, which has appeared increasingly erratic.\u0026nbspMr Musk’s company had said it would shut almost all of its showrooms to focus on online sales before an about turn just 10 days later in which it said most locations would stay open but prices would rise.Created with Sketch.

As part of the changes,customers will be able to lease a Tesla for the first time but with a big caveat: they don’t get the option of buying the car once their lease is up.Why? Because Tesla wants to use them in its planned ride-hailing network which it hopes will take on the likes of Uber and Lyft.All Tesla vehicles now come with the Autopilot driver-assistance system as standard, the company said in a blog post.\u0026nbspThe Model 3 with Standard Plus battery range used to cost $37,500, plus $3,000 for Autopilot. It now costs $39,500 with Autopilot included.The company launched its long-awaited $35,000 version of the car in February to great fanfare. Now the least expensive version available to order online is the Standard Range Plus Model 3 at $39,000.Last week, Tesla reported its biggest ever drop in vehicle sales. The electric car maker revealed the first quarter of 2019 saw 31 per cent less deliveries than the previous quarter, representing a fall of nearly 30,000 vehicles.It is the first time in nearly two years that Tesla has experienced a quarter-to-quarter sales decline but still represents a significant increase from the first quarter of 2018.Tesla\u0027s Model 3 proved to be the firm\u0027s most popular car in the first three months of the year Tesla, representing 50,900 sales. The remainder of sales were made up of Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Uber\u0026nbspsaid it expects operating expenses to “increase significantly in the foreseeable future” as it continues its expansion.\u0026nbspIn a filing with US regulators that revealed its financial health for the first time, Uber also said that its rapid growth has recently slowed.The company had 91 million\u0026nbspaverage monthly users across its platforms, including food-delivery app Uber Eats at the end of 2018 but growth slowed to 33.8 per cent from 51 per cent a year earlier.Those users generated sales of $11.3bn last year, 42 per cent higher than in 2017.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a letter: “Over the past 18 months, we have improved our governance and board oversight built a stronger and more cohesive management team and made the changes necessary to ensure our company culture rewards teamwork and encourages employees to commit for the long term.”Uber has come up against increasing resistance from local taxi operators and regulators around the world, and faced a number of scandals and legal hurdles that have the potential to drag on its future growth.In the UK it has been locked in a legal fight over whether its drivers should be classified as workers employed by the company or self-employed people who are not entitled to rights such as holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber drivers protest on the first day of Uber’s Court of Appeal caseUber’s blockbuster listing on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to raise about $10bn to help fund further expansion.Its closest rival, Lyft, listed its shares at the end of March but has seen its valuation crash 15 per cent since then, suggesting investors’ appetite for risky, loss-making technology firms may be drying up.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not been easy.”Meanwhile,\u0026nbspWikileaks tweeted that Mr Assange’s cat,\u0026nbspMichi, was safe\u0026nbspafter its owner was forcibly removed from the embassy\u0026nbspon Thursday.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Great to smell fresh air says freed Assange Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The cat was given to\u0026nbspAssange by his children four years into his seven-year stay at the embassy.It became a social media sensation after being pictured wearing a tie in the window of the consulate, and had appeared in photos with\u0026nbspAssange on\u0026nbspTwitter and Instagram accounts with the handle @EmbassyCat.Wikileaks tweeted a video of\u0026nbspMichi\u0026nbsplooking at a television showing footage of\u0026nbspAssange’s\u0026nbsparrest.The Wikileaks founder, 47,\u0026nbspfaces up to 12 months in jail in the UK for breaching his bail conditions.

Entitled ‘Invisible People’, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency’s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.Child trafficking for sexual exploitationSome workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – butLabour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential.Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.Spot the signs of forced prostitution:Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector:Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: “This image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection.

Entitled ‘Invisible People’, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency’s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.Child trafficking for sexual exploitationSome workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – butLabour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential.Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.Spot the signs of forced prostitution:Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector:Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: “This image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection.

We only made it to Libya. I was sold, raped and tortured.

My boys will not grow up to be ashamed of their mother. My name is Gift Jonathan and I am not for sale.”Nigeria has one of the highest figures for modern slavery in Africa and is one of the top five countries of origin for modern slavery victims reaching Europe and the UK.In 2018 alone, 208 Nigerian nationals were identified as potential victims of trafficking in the UK.International development secretary Penny Mordaunt said: “Modern slavery is one of the greatest human rights abuses of our time.“UK aid is working in partnership with the National Crime Agency and Nigerian law enforcement to stop it at its source.“Together we are tackling the root causes of dangerous migration to prevent vulnerable women and girls from becoming targeted by traffickers.“The benefits of this will be far-reaching – preventing regional instability and helping us tackle modern slavery here in the UK.”Department for International DevelopmentOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But now we’re holding European elections, not knowing whether MEPs will take their seats or for how long. It’s extraordinary,” he said.“We cannot remain stuck in this loop for another six months.

I found out when I heard it on TV, like everyone else.“It’s scandalous that it came so late in the Brexit process, not at the 11th hour, not even at five to midnight, but at five past midnight after she missed her own deadline of\u0026nbsp29\u0026nbspMarch.Tories face election drubbing as support ‘drops to six-year low’“Nevertheless, we’re engaging in the talks in a serious and constructive way. But we must see those red lines moving and we must see real compromise.”During his address\u0026nbspthe Labour leader also referred to the Westminster political system as “another world”, as he criticised the “alien language” and arcane procedure.“When the focus of our national conversation is dominated by baffling procedures in parliament and when nothing seems to change, I understands why people feel frustrated,” he said.“People watch the back and forth in parliament. They see the arcane procedure and hear the alien language. It’s another world.

It wasn’t to placate his own Eurosceptic MPs instead it was to stop Conservative voters defecting to pro-Brexit parties. That process seems to have restarted and the Conservatives are beginning to suffer.”A separate poll by Opinium put Labour seven points ahead of the Tories.Conservative support dropped six points in a fortnight to stand at 29 per cent – the party’s worst performance in the survey since 2014. The poll put Jeremy Corbyn’s party on 36 per cent, up one point from 29 March.\u0026nbspThe research echoed the findings of YouGov polling which this week found Tory support had slumped to\u0026nbspits lowest level in six years.

The Lib Dems were on 11 per cent, with Ukip in 6 per cent and the Brexit Party on 8 per cent.Mr Corbyn’s ability to form a government in the event of a hung parliament would be likely to depend on the support of the SNP, who could demand a second EU referendum as a bargaining chip.Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, said on Sunday it would be\u0026nbsp”unforgivable” for Labour to avoid a new public vote on Brexit.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Landlords will still be able to end tenancies when they have legitimate reasons to do so, but they will no longer be able to unexpectedly evict families with only eight weeks’ notice.”May should stand down as PM as early as May, says Duncan SmithCorbyn says Brexit talks challenging with ‘collapsing government’May could remain PM until October Brexit deadline, Hammond hintsMay hopes for final shot at forcing withdrawal deal through parliamentTheresa May disowned Tory Brexiteers in meeting with EU leadersCommunities secretary Mr Brokenshire said the government was “making the biggest change to the private rental sector in a generation”, adding:\u0026nbsp“By abolishing these kind of evictions, every single person living in the private rented sector will be empowered to make the right housing choice for themselves –\u0026nbspnot have it made for them.\u0026nbsp“And this will be balanced by ensuring responsible landlords can get their property back where they have proper reason to do so.”Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of the homelessness charity Crisis, said the announcement “represents a monumental leap forward in helping to prevent homelessness” across England.\u0026nbspBut he warned: “While this is undeniably a positive step, we cannot forget that a chronic social housing shortage alongside woefully inadequate levels of housing benefit mean many people struggle to even afford a privately rented home.\u0026nbspBrokenshire\u0026nbspsays government is ‘making the biggest change to the private rental sector in a generation’ (PA)“Ultimately, to ensure people most vulnerable to homelessness are not left with nowhere to turn, the government must urgently address these root causes.”Generation Rent – an organisation that has campaigned for the abolishment of no-fault\u0026nbspevictions since 2015 – said the move was “fantastic” for private renters.\u0026nbspCorbyn: Labour will abolish ‘no fault’ evictions in next manifestoDirector Dan Wilson added: “We’re so proud of the thousands of renters who’ve led this campaign, signing petitions, contacting their MPs and councillors, and sharing their own stories of section 21 evictions and its harmful impact. The 11 million private renters in England are a growing political force and together we can win changes that will transform private renting into a tenure that is fit for purpose in the 21st century.”But the Residential Landlords Association (RLA) said there are “dangers of getting such reforms wrong” and calls on ministers to act with “caution”.Policy director David Smith\u0026nbspsaid: “With the demand for private rented homes continuing to increase, we need the majority of good landlords to have confidence to invest in new homes. This means ensuring they can swiftly repossess properties for legitimate reasons such as rent arrears, tenant anti-social behaviour or wanting to sell them. This needs to happen before any moves are made to end Section 21.”Labour’s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said while any promise of help for renters is “good news”, he added: “This latest pledge won’t work if landlords can still force tenants out by hiking the rent.“For nine years, the Tories have failed to tackle problems facing private renters. Tenants need new rights and protections across the board to end costly rent increases and sub-standard homes as well as stop unfair evictions.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She said she would go as and when the agreement was ratified which was looking at around about May, June.

Up until then people were prepared to give Theresa May the benefit of the doubt,” he said. “The big problem was as soon as we didn’t leave you could see all the poll ratings start to crash.”On participation in the European elections on 23 May – something the UK is legally bound to take part in if a Brexit deal is not agreed by the date of the election – Mr Duncan Smith added: “It would be a disaster for the country.

It means MPs in the party cannot attempt to topple Ms May again until December – a year on since she successfully saw off a bid by Brexiteers.May could remain PM until October Brexit deadline, Hammond hintsLord Spicer and Lord Hamilton wrote in The Sunday : “Conservative MPs are responsible for their party. If they wish to change these rules there is nothing standing in their way.”Chair\u0026nbspof the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady also told the newspaper: “It is my understanding that the rules could in future be changed by the agreement of the 1922 executive.”He added that it was “less certain that it would be possible to change the rules during the current period of grace which was initiated with the triggering of a confidence vote on 12 December\u0026nbsplast year”.Speaking on Friday, Mr Hammond said: “The prime minister has said that she will leave once she has done the deal and taken us out of the European Union.The chancellor said that as far as he was aware “she doesn’t have any intention of leaving until that deal is done”, adding: “So, she is a person with a strong sense of duty. She feels that she has got a duty, and an obligation to the British people to deliver Brexit and she will certainly want to make good on that obligation.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it was only when the pair came home, entered the flat, and two assailants jumped out from behind the curtains that he started to realise\u0026nbsphow badly wrong things had gone.The men announced to\u0026nbspSergei\u0026nbspthat his date was, in fact, a minor – even though his profile and appearance suggested he was at least 20. The attackers\u0026nbspgave their victim\u0026nbspa frightening ultimatum: “20,000 rubles (£250) or be outed as a poof and reported as a paedophile.”\u0026nbspSergei\u0026nbspwas lucky that a 20-year army career meant he could stand up to the men physically. After an hour, he managed to persuade them to go outside so he could try to get money from a cashpoint. From there, he ran. \u0026nbspHis story is one of several\u0026nbspcrimes committed against gay men in Moscow over the last month.The Independent was able to speak\u0026nbspto three of the targeted men. They\u0026nbspsuggested that gangs operating in the capital had identified gay men as easy – and silent – victims.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The top 15 worst countries to be gay in Europe Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This content is subject to copyright.This content is subject to copyright.The mechanism is\u0026nbspalmost always the same. Handsome young men entrap unwitting victims on dating apps and other gay sites. They lure victims to an apartment, where several other gang members are waiting. The assailants film their victim, extort money and threaten them with outing or worse. Usually, the victims pay up for a quiet life. On the occasions that they don’t, things can end brutally.\u0026nbspWhile an unwelcome reminder of the difficulties of being gay in Russia, these incidents are not an entirely new phenomenon —\u0026nbspor even the worst examples of homophobia.\u0026nbspChechnya\u0026nbspaside, the peak of anti-gay violence in Russia came about four years ago, when groups led by the nationalist\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspMartsinkevich\u0026nbsp(aka “The Hatchet”) entrapped, beat and humiliated dozens of gay men on camera.\u0026nbspMartsinkevich\u0026nbspand his “Occupy\u0026nbspPedophilia” gang operated on the heels of the Kremlin’s 2013 infamous anti-gay law.But Martsinkevich\u0026nbspand his crew were always less concerned with money than with serving a warped ideology.\u0026nbspActivists say the vast majority of the more recent attacks have been economic in their aims.When it’s clear homophobic crimes are at play, the state does everything to avoid prosecutionThat does not mean there have not been victims of violence. On several occasions, young men have been found in pools of blood following apparent robbery attempts, and without obvious signs of forced entry.\u0026nbspBut today’s gangs do tend to be less violent, and instead use the taboo of homosexuality in society to keep the crimes as hidden as possible.\u0026nbspIt’s an effective enough strategy, says Igor\u0026nbspKochetkov, the head of the Russian\u0026nbspLGBT\u0026nbspNetwork, a prominent advocacy group.\u0026nbsp“People are reluctant to go to the police because they don’t want to reveal their orientation,” he says. “And the regular homophobic statements from officials don’t exactly encourage them.”\u0026nbspRussia reinstates yoga into prisons following claims it turned inmatesThe Russian court system is not set up to help them, the activist says. When the odd case does reach court, it is usually processed as hooliganism or robbery the hate element is never included as an aggravating factor. When\u0026nbspMartsinkevich\u0026nbspwas finally arrested and jailed in late 2014, for example, it was for a racist video. No mention was made of the anti-gay aspects of his extremism.\u0026nbsp“When it’s clear homophobic crimes are at play, such as what happened in\u0026nbspChechnya, the state does everything to avoid prosecution,”\u0026nbspsays Kochetkov.\u0026nbspAccording to Andrei Petrov, programme director of the\u0026nbspLGBT+ advocacy group Stimulus,\u0026nbspa lack of successful prosecutions is allowing the problem of date extortion to become more widespread.\u0026nbspIn a survey conducted by his organisation in 2018, one in five members of the\u0026nbspLGBT+ community reported that they had been victims of such hate crimes. Only a similar percentage report the crimes to police, and even fewer are properly investigated.\u0026nbspGiven the lack of progress in Russian courts, Stimulus has decided to try their luck with the European Court of Human Rights.\u0026nbspTwo killed and 40 held in new Chechen gay ‘purge’, activists sayTheir test case, which dates from 2017, follows the familiar pattern. The victim,\u0026nbspYevgeny, 39, surname withheld, answered a profile on a love.mail.ru, a well-known dating site. He sent his picture the other party sent his, and the pair agreed to meet by a block of flats in Moscow’s suburbs. Again, there were warning signs. The date said his name was\u0026nbspDima\u0026nbspin messages, but introduced himself as\u0026nbspDanila. But regardless,\u0026nbspYevgeny\u0026nbspagreed to go upstairs to the\u0026nbspflat.There, a gang of eight men were waiting. They made sure\u0026nbspYevgeny’s\u0026nbspquick date instead ended in a heavy beating, a request for money, and a threat to call the police for “paedophilia”.\u0026nbspEventually,\u0026nbspYevgeny\u0026nbspplucked up the courage to report the crime to the police. But since then, two years have passed without progress, with investigators refusing to open a criminal investigation.\u0026nbsp“I believe the police were covering them up,”\u0026nbspYevgeny\u0026nbspsays. “I’ve no doubt the guys think they are completely untouchable.”\u0026nbspActivists and victims allege the Russian government’s own “homophobia”\u0026nbsphas fuelled the extortion business.\u0026nbsp“The reason why these guys are getting away with it is because they are on the same side,” says\u0026nbspSergei. “One thing gives birth to another. They know they are doing the state’s work.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Through [Easter Sunday] evening, a lot of the cloud will melt away [and] we’ll see starry skies developing.By Monday, there will a change as colder weather s, and temperatures will tumble under those clear skies again, falling below freezing in the countryside.Thicker cloud and stronger winds across the far southwest and parts of Northern Ireland will keep temperatures from falling too low.But it leads to a cloudy start on Monday morning, some patchy rain... spreading into Cornwall and Devon through the morning [and] still some showers down the east coast, Dewhurst added.Central parts of the UK will feel a little warmer on Easter Monday, with temperatures expected to reach  C.But in the west, under the cloud, therell be some heavy rain and also a brisk wind, meaning it will also continue to feel quite chilly.He said: “Elsewhere, there is plenty of sunshine, through Monday morning.Unlike Halloween, Christmas and Valentine’s Day which all fall on fixed dates, Easter can be anytime between March  and April .In  it falls on Sunday, April .Good Friday is therefore April , and the Easter Monday bank holiday is on April .The date is decided by a complex set of calculations based on observations of the moon.In early Christianity, dferent churches used dferent methods, leading to disagreements which remain unresolved centuries later.Eastern and Western churches continue to celebrate Easter according to dferent calendars, although sometimes by chance the festivals coincide."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000446080399.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tories must keep out of our plates","story":"The Sun has long argued that education and exercise are infinitely more important and effective than destructive bans and taxes.

Moving “junk food” away from checkouts  Nine.These are negligible amounts, even added together.And they lay bare the arrogant folly of a Conservative Party which, in its panic over obesity and NHS resources, has surrendered to the middle-class public health zealots who spend their lives ­tut-tutting at working people’s grub.They imposed a tax on sugary drinks despite no firm evidence that it has cut obesity in any country which has tried it. It didn’t work there. It won’t here.Nor is there any basis to believe banning fast food ads on the Tube will reduce one single person’s weight. It’s a theory. A hunch.

To say that leaving the EU, which they used to claim had negligible impact on our sovereignty, is in fact too hard. That it’s “undeliverable”.Remainer politicians told .million Leavers a pack of lies about honouring their vote. Now, as they hoped, Brexit is “delayed” again. And the EU, with whom some openly colluded, are gloating about it maybe being reversed.You think our nation is humiliated now  Wait until MPs revoke Article .The Tories are carrying the can, and fair enough. But at least most have tried to deliver what the majority wanted.Corbyn’s MPs duped Leavers, then opposed every step towards Brexit, in a disgusting assault on our democracy.Let’s hope democracy bites them back.DO not forget the blinkered delusions of the Tory ERG in this betrayal.They convinced themselves Brexit was inevitable. The law was on their side. Remainer tricks could not stop them. They fatally rejected the one viable deal, thinking a harder one was days away.It was all cobblers. They missed what everyone outside their bubble could see: they were outnumbered by Remainers who will scrap Brexitthey can.Yet the ERG still won’t back Theresa May’s deal. They are still in denial.Yes, their Brexit might be possible under a charismatic new Tory leader with a thumping Commons majority.Anyone see that happening THEY backed the Kremlin over the Salisbury poisonings. Now Labour backs the fantasist, coward and fugitive Julian Assange.See the pattern  It’s not just that Corbyn’s rabble are reliably on the wrong side of history. It’s that they support any enemy of Britain, America and the West.Assange jumped bail to dodge arrest over a rape case.

But there are risks to this approach.Labour coming out for a second referendum would cost them in their Leave-voting seats and in the places they must win to form a government.Of the  seats in England and Wales that Corbyn needs to get a majority,  voted Leave. While  of his  most vulnerable seats backed Brexit.Corbyn’s other option is to do a deal with Mrs May.If he pushed her into accepting a customs union, then he would further ide the Tories.A deal would also mean Britain was out and that Corbyn could fight the next election on the domestic issues he cares about most.As one Cabinet Minister puts it: “There is an appeal for Corbyn to support something. He can create fissures within the Tory party, look serious, andhe becomes PM he doesn’t have to deal with all this crap.” But there are big risks to this approach, too.If Corbyn helped a Brexit deal over the line, there would almost certainly be more defections from the Labour Party.It would also produce a rallying cry for Chuka and Co.They would be able to tell pro-Remain votersthat Labour had betrayed them, that it could have stopped Brexit but chose not to.This is a finely balanced decision for Corbyn. But he doesn’t have long to make up his mind. If the Tories take a pasting in either next month’s local elections or the European elections, then Mrs May could be gone as Tory leader — replaced by a Brexiteer.This new Tory leader would immediately break off talks with Corbyn.If he wants to do a deal, he needs to DO IT SOON. Which way will he go Well, one of those involved tells me that the situation in the talks is “less negative than people think”. But the likelihood of these talks producing something remains low. What would make a deal attractive to Jeremy Corbyn would make it unpalatable to Theresa May.Another complication is that, as one Cabinet Minister points out, “It’s quite finely balanced that a May Corbyn deal could get through” the Commons as Labour MPs passionately in favour of a second referendum would vote against it, as would Tories who viscerally oppose a customs union.The depressing truth is that there is now a growing risk that the Tory party doesn’t deliver Brexit AND doesn’t stop Jeremy Corbyn from getting to Number . This would be an epic failure.Unless the Tory hold-outs decide to back the existing deal when they come back from their holidays, this danger will become increasingly real.CONSERVATIVE MPs are taking a second look at Boris Johnson.The former Foreign Secretary has more critics on the Tory benches than any other leadership contender.But the party’s precipitous fall in the polls is making Tories reconsider.If they are losing a quarter of their support to pro-Brexit parties, who is better placed to win those voters back than the man who led the Leave campaign  Boris’s campaign is more organised than it was.The arrival of the former MP James Wharton has helped and, as one of those on the team puts it, MPs are now “petried about their seats” and so more prepared to swallow their doubts about Boris.A decade ago, one of those who knows the Tory party best told me that the Tories would only turn to Boris when they were - down with  minutes to go.They now are three down and that means Boris is back in contention for the premiership.MRS MAY might still be in the post. But make no mistake, the Tory leadership contest is under way.We have now even got ministers saying on live TV who they will back when there’s a contest.This week, the Treasury Minister Mel Stride got  or so Tory MPs who want Michael Gove to run for leader together with their potential candidate for drinks.One of those present tells me it is increasingly likely that Gove will run.THE big decision on whether to press ahead with HS has to be taken in December.But with a change of Tory leader likely to happen before then, the project is in trouble.Scrapping the scheme would give any new PM billions to spend on other projects, such as better transport within and between northern cities and proper, digital infrastructure for the whole of the UK.There’ll be no shortage of candidates making this case come a Tory leadership contest.THE six-month Brexit extension is the wrong .It is neither short enough to force MPs to make up their minds about what they want, nor is it long enough to allow for a new Prime Minister and a general election campaign.Emmanuel Macron wanted to give Britain a short extension to force a decision, Angela Merkel favoured one long enough to give the UK time to come up with a new path. In the end, they compromised on this medium- extension.“Two potential routes out and they went to the middle one that delivers us to nowhere,” laments one Cabinet Minister.There is a real danger that the Brexit drt continues for another six months. This useless Parliament knows what it doesn’t want, but can’t say what it would actually accept.If this happens, Britain will end up back at the EU Council in October asking for a THIRD EXTENSION.This would be ridiculous. But one Secretary of State predicts that this is “where we’ll probably end up and at that point Macron’s view will probably prevail”.The French President might be so full of himself that you think he’s going to burst.But he’s right that only a HARD DEADLINE will force our MPs to make up their minds.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why stand in them If they are still serious that we are leaving the EU, why waste money fielding candidates as Tory MEPs Leavers will vote for Nigel Farage’s new outfit now anyway.THE sacking of housing expert Roger Scruton exposes a Tory Party and political system derailed by one website: Twitter.Scruton’s blunt remarks on Islamophobia, Hungary and the Chinese were quoted out of context by a left-wing journo who cynically stitched him up, then gloatingly toasted his downfall.But today’s Tories lack the spine to face down a leftie Twitter mob.So they indulge in virtue-signalling or desperate damage-limitation.Two hastily demanded Scruton be fired. One, without irony, said it was a “no-brainer”.Housing Secretary James Brokenshire brainlessly obliged. Their mistake became obvious too late.Politicians forever come a cropper with knee-jerk tweets.Like Tory chairman Brandon Lewis demanding Boris Johnson apologise for burka remarks most of Britain then backed.MPs are hooked on it and presumably imagine Britain is too.But political Twitter is a bubble, not the national conversation.A visit to any town or city outside the M would tell them that.And the Tories and Labour might then begin to grasp the white-hot rage felt by millions over the abysmal state of our politics and MPs’ infantile tribal games.WE hope the Tory ERG have a long, hard and sober think over their Easter break.They may want to be remembered as heroic holdouts against a softish Brexit.Butthe decision of .million ­people is overturned, and the Tories are ousted by hard-left extremists who inflict poverty on Britain, it will not be the Remainer MPs history recalls.Fair or not, it will be two dozen ERG members who had the sole viable Brexit deal in their grasp and threw it away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In fact, it’s quite the opposite.For a start, not one recipient seems grateful.But more importantly, we are almost skint ourselves, so not exactly in a position to be flash with our cash.Are you aware that we have to pay £BILLION A YEAR simply in interest, servicing our own debt.So that is before we pay off any of the actual debt.So spending £billion a year on an ill-thought-through and poorly executed aid policy in the name of an arbitrary spending target seems nonsensical to me.A couple of recent examples of the kind of thing that some foreign aid is spent on once it has been allocated include fixing potholes in Pakistan and India and helping an all-female pop group dubbed the Ethiopian Spice Girls.But another story this week shines even more light on how misguided our foreign aid spending is.Auditors investigating the way £.billion was spent through charities found poor management practices and delays by the Department for International Development, which was described as “dithering”, risked completely wasting the money.The net result is that these foreign aid projects — which spend ten per cent of our aid budget — are “unlikely to achieve lasting change”.So not only are we throwing money we can not afford at a problem that is not ours, that money may as well be flushed away for all the good it is doing.How galling is that  Just to reiterate, we are talking about a whopping £.billion here — not just a few thousand quid.This is enough money to change lives here profoundly and on a very grand scale.But that brings me back to my first point: Why on earth are we giving away such a colossal amount of money when we really are not in a position to do so And it was recently revealed that more than million people in the UK are living in poverty.By the way, that figure includes .million children who are living below the breadline — and suffering badly as a result.More than half of them will not be able to get themselves out of poverty and will find themselves trapped in a cycle that goes on for years, according to a new measure for tracking poverty that has brought together specialists from across the political spectrum.The scary thing is that even a relatively comfortable income is no guarantee that people can meet basic material needs —that income is eaten up by unavoidable weekly outgoings.And this problem is getting worse, not better. By - the proportion of children living in relative povertyis on course to hit  per cent — exceeding the previous record high of  per cent in the early s.This could mean an extra one million children living in poverty in the next five years.In other words, we have a serious problem on our hands.Many people will no doubt blame austerity for the increase in poverty over the past few years. And yes, sure, it is true that the cuts and freezes to welfare and disability benefits have had an impact.But just imagine the ways in which £.billion could begin to make a massive material impact on the lives of poverty-stricken people in this country.I believe that we should reserve some money — a couple of billion, say — for overseas catastrophes, such as tsunamis.But other than that, let’s stop giving away money that could be much, much better spent at home.I KNOW Jeremy Kyle has interviewed some dubious characters over the years, but the biscuit was well and truly taken this week by Georgina Clarke.This -year-old mother is so obsessed with cosmetic surgery that she allowed her daughter Kayla, aged , to dance for, and sleep with, a “sugar daddy” who then paid for both of them to have plastic surgery.Why does an -year-old “need” cosmetic surgery, you may ask.Kayla blamed the pressures of social media, as well as glamorous celebrities such as the Kardashians for making her want bigger boobs and plumped-up lips.But instead of reassuring her daughter that she didn’t need surgery, this mother gave it her blessing.Georgina justied this to Jeremy by saying she found surgery “quite addictive”, and revealed – unsurprisingly –  she is still not happy with her own look.It’s easy to wonder whether that therefore means she’ll be encouraging her daughter to wine, dine and dance for a few more older men.As mothers, we are meant to give our daughters self-esteem and confidence, not encourage them to surgically “improve” themselves.And for a mother to encourage her daughter to fund that surgery, as well as her own, by sleeping with a dirty old man The only explanation is that her moral compass is severely and sadly lacking.I can still remember going to watch Grease when it came out the first time. I got dressed up in a boob tube and skin-tight trouserswhen I was all of nine years old.And I can’t wait to see the prequel, although I probably won’t wear the boob tube this time around.Mind you, I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve said that over the years so... never say never.WE all have moments of fantasising about just how much better le would bewe won the lottery and never had to work again.But for all too many people, realising their wildest dreams with a win turns out to be a le change that’s incompatible with the le they have lived so far.Britain’s biggest lottery winners, Colin and Christine Weir, have turned out to be the latest lottery casualties.This week they announced they’re orcing – eight years after scooping the £million jackpot.Colin, , and Christine, , took home the EuroMillions British record in  and had been married for  years before their recent split.In fact, let’s all take a moment to count our lucky stars that we haven’t won the lottery this week.IT’S hard to believe that Lori Loughlin and her husband could be facing  years in prison and fines of more than a million dollars for allegedly bribing officials in a bid to get their daughters into the University of Southern Calornia.I mean, yes, I know that bribing your child’s way through university is dishonest, dishonourable and not at all admirable.But  years in prison for doing so That does seem a little harsh.Justice has been served and his mum was given a -month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete a -day rehabilitation activity.Far worse, though, she has now lost her son, who has been adopted into another family. Thank God for adopters.A judge told the woman – who can’t be identied for legal reasons – that leaving her son in such a state was “reprehensible” and “goes against the instinct of any caring mother”, which is true.Anyone who becomes a parent needs to understand that kids are forever.I speak from experience, by the way – mine are  and  and there’s still no independence in sight.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Over the past few weeks the EU has done just that to Theresa May.Only the dference is, we keep being flogged not because we tried to escape the EU but we failed to even TRY to escape.After all, we could have escaped with no deal on March , then again on April  and now we will have to put up with more floggings as we delay our departure until October.In the midst of this humiliating and embarrassing national failure, just when you think it can’t get worse, up pops the Chancellor glibly saying there will be a vote on holding another Brexit referendum and that the Government agree on a lot with Labour.This flies in the face of the fact that, in marginal seats around the country, Conservatives are aghast the Government wants to do a deal with Labour.Remember, this is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, which wants a Customs Union, alignment with the EU single market and a second referendum.It’s BRINO — Brexit In Name Only.Worse, Corbyn’s brand of anti-British, Venezuelan-supporting Marxism is the single biggest threat to the UK’s future prosperity.Intriguingly, the Chancellor’s statement contradicts the Government’s previous view. After all, the Prime Minister used to say Corbyn wasn’t fit to be Prime Minister.The negotiating strategy it adopted has been aimed at trying to make an example of the UK to stop other countries thinking of leaving.At the heart of this has been their determination to insist on a deeply damaging set of proposals for the Northern Ireland border.It is these demands which have made it impossible to get a deal through the House of Commons. Those who believe in the importance of the union of the United Kingdom recognise the need to stand up for the rights of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK.The EU’s arrogant refusal to continue negotiating a better way forward, using alternative border arrangements, is a deliberate attempt to interfere in the nature of the UK.In this they are supported by French President Emmanuel Macron, whose somewhat pompous elitism is in stark contrast to his poll ratings — which have been so low you could slide them under a snake.Instead of confronting the EU, prepared to leave by rejecting its deal, the Prime Minister has instead taken a dangerous decision.This is to agree to the EU demand for a longer extension, up to October  — a further  days of membership.This isn’t just a delay until October, it comes with strings attached. The EU demands that we fight next month’s Euro elections.This will be an utter disaster.At a cost to taxpayers of more than £million, and around £billion each month in EU membership fees, we would elect MEP’s who would have to leave office when we leave the EU in October.These will be elections no one really wants and would go down in history as the most pointless and expensive electoral mistake.There was a time when the Prime Minister had the sympathy of the nation. People used to give her the benefit of the doubt.They recognised that in a Parliament stuffed with an overwhelming majority of anti-Brexit Remainers, and with a Remain-leaning Cabinet, it was dficult for her.Most people I have spoken to hung on to the pledge the PM made to leave the EU on March .They remembered her constant refrain that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and persuaded themselves such a pledge would be delivered on.That all changed when we didn’t leave on March . Gone is that sense of sympathy and trust and in its place is a growing sense of betrayal. The country is crying out for strong leadership.Yet it is not too late. We can, even at this eleventh hour, rediscover our belief in the UK as a self-governing nation, the world’s fth largest economy and one of the most influential.After all, despite all the Project Fear warnings, while the Eurozone is mostly in recession the UK’s economy is growing, employment is at a record high and youth unemployment at a near-record low.No, we don’t need to fear anything.The Prime Minister has already said she is stepping down. She needs to heed the concerns, including those of her MPs, and not let this drag out.What better legacy than one where she recognises the optimism of the British people when they voted to leave the EU.They instinctively know that our best days are ahead of us. Now is the time to refuse to be bullied by the EU any more — no more national humiliation.If the EU won’t change their deal, she should say the UK will simply leave.Now that’s a great legacy, Prime Minister. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its a dficult situation.Ecuador has made these allegations to justy the unlawful and extraordinary act of letting police come inside an embassy.But his arrest  means the investigation  could  be reopened after a request from an alleged victim.Deputy chief prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson said: “We will now examine the matter to determine how we proceed. The preliminary investigation has therefore not been resumed yet and we do not know today whether it will happen. We cannot promise any timetable for when decisions will be made.”Assange was accused of attacking a woman after they met at a WikiLeaks conference in Stockholm in .  She alleged that Assange had unprotected sex with her while she was asleep even though she had refused him repeatedly.The case  was dropped in May  after the director of public prosecutions ruled it impossible to proceed while he was under Ecuador’s protection.But yesterday, the woman’s lawyer Elisabeth Massi Fritz piled pressure on prosecutors, saying: “No rape victim should have to wait nine years to see justice be served.”When asked about the truthfulness of certain allegations, Robinson said: Thats not true.She also said Assange went into the embassy in  to avoid US injustice rather than justice in Sweden.Robinson claims her client has cooperated with the Swedish investigation into allegations of rape and sexual misconduct."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000483040632.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dad cape verde pneumonia holiday","story":"Peter Mazur, , fell ill while staying at the five-star Rio Touraeg hotel on the island of Boa Vista.Distressed we Becky said he had been feeling “absolutely fine” when they jetted off on their dream family holiday with five-year-old son Oliver on April .His family have launched a desperate plea for him to be flown off the island to get to a proper hospital for treatment.The -year-old fears her husband’s days are numbered as she says she has been fighting for five days to get him transferred by air ambulance to a hospital in Gran Canaria - km away.The hairdresser from Felixstowe, Suffolk, claims there has been “no help” and now the untreated pneumonia has spread to cover most of Peter’s left lung.She said: “We have had no help.

It might yet be too late.The genuine stock of sympathy and support commanded by this “bloody dficult woman” evaporated completely on March , her promised date for Brexit.All those reassuring poll leads over Labour turn out to be an illusion, bolstered by Ukip deserters who rallied to the Tories for the  ­General ­Election.They trusted Mrs May in  when she promised “Brexit means Brexit” and in  as she vowed “No Deal is better than a bad deal”.

His partially mummied remains are also in the tomb.Saqqara, west of the Nile, is home to the biggest collection of tombs and pyramids in Egypt but is overshadowed by Giza,  miles away.Other sites excavated there have contained mummied cats, mice, dogs and falcons.Djedkare Isesi was the first to build a pyramid to the south of the main necropolis in Saqqara.Today, the ft structure, which towers over a nearby village, is known locally as The Sentinel.Khaled al-Enani, Egypt’s antiquities minister, joined by the Egyptian actress Yosra, , led a group of  foreign ambassadors and cultural attaches on a tour of the site on Saturday.Mr Enani announced that two more new discoveries will be unveiled in Luxor, along with the restoration of a colossus of Ramses II, on World Heritage Day on Thursday.He said that the country’s museums and archaeological sites would be free to visit for Egyptians, Africans, Arabs and foreigners residing in Egypt for the day.The country has embarked on a drive to uncover new historical treasures in an effort to lure tourists back after years of revolution, upheaval and terrorist attacks.Three big renovation projects have been announced since the start of this year - Philae temple in Aswan, the Graeco-Roman museum in Alexandria and the New Valley museum near the town of Kharga.A version of this story originally appeared on The Times."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000482850185.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"philip hammond mocks tory leadership hopefuls","story":"He singled out Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who both lost out to Theresa May during the last leadership contest in .In a speech in Washington, Mr Hammond also suggested Andrea Leadsom had “kned herself” at the same time.He joked that he might be the only Tory MP not to be setting out his stall for a new anticipated contest, which would see a much “wider field,” the Dailyreported.It comes after Tory grandees have been accused of launching a stop Boris campaign to make sure Boris Johnson can never become Prime Minister.Remain-backing MPs are jostling for position to try and shut out the Brexiteer big beast.But his backers insisted Boris is a big winner who has been targeted by targeted by enemies in the party for more than a decade.Boris Johnson is the bookies favourite to take over from Theresa May when she quits later this year.In recent days Sajid Javid launched his own leadership campaign with a speech to Tory MPs where he emphasised his humble roots.And Dominic Raab laid out his pitch by calling for huge cuts in stamp duty to help renters get on to the property ladder.Other leading contenders are likely to include Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Matt Hancock.Former leader Ian Duncan Smith called for Theresa May to step down as soon as next month after delaying Brexit for a second time.He told Sky News: I know that the Prime Minister has already said shes going.She said she would go as and when the agreement was ratied which was looking at around about May, June.

Theresa May is being destroyed by her party’s nationalist reactionaries just like her predecessors David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher. Her replacement will be too when warring families in this bloody civil war will never accept another’s king in the final series of the Tory version of Game of Thrones. Voters are punishing the Tories, who are plummeting in the polls ahead of May ’s English council elections then May ’s European contests, reflecting how much Brexit is a Conservative shambles.    From Cameron betting and losing No on a tactical gamble to Mrs May’s botched negotiations and thumping Parliamentary defeats, this is a Tory show. Oxford University social geographer Danny Dorling exposed the myth of the  referendum as a Northern working class revolution when Southern middle class Tories overwhelmingly delivered a narrow result sneaked on lies and illegality. Just like Cameron, May is being demolished by two-thirds of Tory voters backing Brexit when two-thirds of Labour wanted to stay in Europe. Below a line from the Humber to the Severn, we find % of all quitters lived in southern England and % were middle class. The proportion of Leave voters in the lowest two social classes was just %.    It’s why the Labour leader in the European Parliament, Richard Corbett, should be heeded when he argues that Labour will gain most by promising a people’s vote. Jeremy Corbyn is not convinced and nor are a sizeable rump of his MPs in seats in the North and Midlands, plus a few in South Wales, afraid of Nigel Farage’s noisy protesters. Predictions that the Cons would lose  seats in a General Election and Labour’s  MPs would put Corbyn at the head of the biggest party, ruling as a minority or in coalition, are more likely to see him stick than twist. Nobody on the Labour side I’ve spoken to expects talks with May to succeed or, I suspect, wants them to. Brexit is breaking the Tories, yet Labour is still ided over how to pick up the pieces. Rather than relying on the Cons to lose the next election, Corbyn could win as leader of a British socialist party offering hope in Europe. We’re not there yet.

It can be based on facts and respect for each other.” Pollster Andrew Cooper writes in the report: “The  referendum left a bad taste in the mouth.“Fake news, project fear and undeliverable promises damaged trust in politics and were a chief cause of the chaotic, never-ending Brexit process to which the nation has since been subjected.”"},{"url":null,"title":"businessman 48 filmed girlfriend having","story":"NewsBusinessman, , filmed his girlfriend having sex with his dogsWayne Horkan, of Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, had also downloaded , still images involving sexual acts with dogs and horsesShareByRoss McCarthy:,  APR NewsWayne Horkan appeared at Birmingham Crown Court \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA businessman who filmed his girlfriend having sex with his dogs has been spared jail.

Timothy Harrington, prosecuting, said: Two of the videos, it was readily apparent, involved a woman with whom the defendant had been in a relationship with.

Once in Porto the flight was subject to a slot constraint and so the decision was taken to disembark passengers for their comfort. The slot delay unfortunately caused crew to exceed their legal working hours limit so passengers were provided with refreshment vouchers and offered coach transfers to Lisbon. After customers had disembarked a slot became available and so the flight operated an empty sector to Lisbon to ensure it could operate later sectors. Although this is outside of easyJetaposs control, we would like to apologise to passengers for the inconvenience caused and thank them for their patience.

Amy Thornton, a forensic artist, used a D print from a CT scan of the prehistoric creatureaposs skull to recreate the animalaposs likeness.It is believed to be the size of a large Collie with similar facial characteristics to a European grey wolf, The Daily Record reports.The skull itself was found at Cuween Hill in Orkney in  - one of  discovered there along with the remains of eight human beings. It is thought the dogs were buried there more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting a ritual burial.    Ms Thornton used identical techniques to those the ones she would usually use to recreate a human head in her day job. She said: The reconstruction was originally created in clay using traditional methods, with a D print of the Cuween Hill skull as the base to build the anatomy on to. The completed sculpture was then cast in silicone and finished with the fur coat resembling a European grey wolf, as advised by experts. The resulting model gives us a fascinating glimpse at this ancient animal. Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at Historic Environment Scotland who co-produced the image, said: Just as they are treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.    But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago. Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the aposdog peopleapos. While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time. The model will go on display in Orkney this year.

Pal Shahin Munir has now revealed how her bombshell secret helped to convict Shafileaaposs parents. Sixteen-year-old Shafilea was killed in  in a horrendous “honour killing” by her father and mother, who suffocated her by shoving a plastic bag down her throat after years of abuse. Her body was found in a river in Cumbria six months after she went missing from the family home in Warrington, Cheshire. But for nine years her parents, Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed, believed that had got away with the cowardly murder as police struggled to find evidence to charge them. It was only after one of the sisters, Alesha, broke ranks and agreed to testy in court that she had witnessed her parents kill Shafilea that they were finally charged with her murder.    But prosecutors knew that still might not be enough to convict them - until Shahin Munir came forward with a terrible secret she had kept for the last four years. Shahin produced photocopies of a letter, written by another of the sisters, Mevish, which described seeing the murder with exactly the same details as Alesha’s account. The evidence was now overwhelming and the Ahmeds were found guilty of the murder and jailed for a minimum of  years. Now Shahin has spoken of the moment she first discovered her friend had been murdered, and why she decided to break a vow of secrecy to reveal the secret in a new documentary When Missing Turns to Murder on the Investigation+Crime channel. Shahin Munir became friends with Shafilea and her three siblings after going to the same mosque as them.    After Shafilea was found dead one of them, Mevish, who was now  and studying at the same college as Shahin, began to confide in her about the cruel way her parents used to treat her sister. She said: “For one reason or another she started opening up to me about when Shafilea would be locked outside, that Shafilea would quite often be beaten up, how she wasn’t allowed to do anything. “There were physical beatings, they was a lot of emotional abuse going on, there was a lot of isolation for Shafilea where she’d be locked in her room or even outside. “When Shafilea was in the garden they would try to pass food to her without her mum seeing. “Our friendship was based on the fact that she would open up to me about the things that went on at home, and I was the person she would talk to when things got really bad. She had a genuine fear for her le too.”    When in , four years after Shafilea’s death, Mevish said she wanted to tell her something important, Shahin suggested she write it down in a letter. She said: “At that point I did have an inkling that it would be about Shafilea. I knew this was a big thing for her, I knew it took a lot for her to actually be able to trust me to this extent. “She messaged me saying, ‘Ok, I’ve written it down. “She was going to town that day with her mum, so I got there first and as they walked past she dropped the letters behind her without her mum seeing. “I picked them up and left as quick as i could, in fact i didn’t even look at them until I got home into my bedroom. I say cross-legged and started opening the letters.” Mevish had written in detail about the night her mother murdered Shafilea, while her brother and two sisters looked on.  She said: “They sat Shafilea down on this chair, they had this one chair where they would sit her and the family would gather round, and that’s when they started abusing her and beating her, one would hold her body and one would physically abuse her. “They got a plastic bag and they put it in her mouth and held her down on the sofa, and she struggled until she stopped. And then the kids were told to go upstairs to their room. “Her dad got rid of the body and her mum after came in the bedroom and got into bed with them like everything was normal. “And from that point on the kids understood, you’ll never talk about this again.” Describing her shock, she said: “I always understood the notion of honour within a family, I always understood the notion of shame within a community but I never believed that you could take it so far that you would kill your own.” In the letters the teenager told how Shafilea wet herself as she died, and her mother spent weeks constantly cleaning the sofa to get rid of it. And how they saw her dad put something in the boot of his car and drive off, believing it to be Shafilea’s body. And she wrote how she was constantly plagued by nightmares about the murder. Shahin remembered: “She asked for her letters back, which I knew she would, I think she was too afraid that somebody would find out. I met up with her gave her them back, and without even thinking she ripped them.”  But she had secretly made photocopies of the letters - which she kept for the next four years, telling no-one of their contents. A regular visitor to the Ahmed home before and after Shafilea’s death, Shahin saw the way the parents, who believed their daughter was becoming too “Westernised”, tried to control her. She said: “It was almost an uncomfortable feeling being around the family, because they seemed to be very controlled over everything they said, the conversations they had or what other family members were doing. Eldest daughter Shafilea wanted to wear western clothes like her friends, and have boyfriend she chose for herself. She  repeatedly refused her parents calls for an arranged marriage, which in her their eyes brought shame on the family. Shanin said: “Shafilea did have relationships with boys, you go to school with them, you get to know people. She was texting them but of course all of that had to be hidden. “It couldn’t be on her mobile phone in case her parents would check it, so that aspect of her le was very well hidden.” Six months before her death, Shafilea drank bleach in Pakistan after her parents took her there with the intention of marrying her off. Shanin recalled: “There were talks of a marriage to one of her cousins. She needed an escape, and for her the escape was, ‘I’m going to drink bleach. Because hopefully it’s going to end all of this’. All of her throat was completely burned from the bleach, she was very much skin and bones. Shanin said: “It was only when Shafilea was getting worse and worse that they were forced to buy aticket.  The story was told that actually she drank it by accident, she thought it was mouthwash.” Shafilea was killed on September ,  after her mother Farzana, , collected her from her call centre job and found that she was showing her arms by wearing a T-shirt. After killing her, Shafilea’s father Iftikhar, , is believed to have driven his daughter’s body  miles to Sedgwick, in the Lake District - where he dumped it next to the River Kent. Her remains were found five months later. Shanin said: “When Shafilea’s body was found it changed everything. It was found in a really horrible way and she must have had a really horrible death. It really upset me that someone in the community had died in such a horric manner.”  It was four years later when Mevish, unable to bear the burden of having to keep her sister’s death a secret, opened up to Shahin. Shahin, who had promised never to tell anyone, finally broke her vow of silence four years after that, after being impressed by the courage of Shafilea’s other sister, Alesha, who testied against her parents in court in August . Helen Morris, of the Crown Prosecution Service, described the moment Alesha stood up in court to face the parents who thought they would never be found out. She said: “She was screened from her parents, but the jury could see her. “They were absolutely gripped by what she was saying. She gave an account of how her mother had gone to collect Shafilea from her part time job in a call centre. “Shafilea was apparently wearing a T-shirt, was showing her arms and this had upset her mother.” She said that after getting into a heated argument at home, her mother “suddenly decided she’d had enough and she said words to effect of ‘let’s finish it here’. “She described how Shafilea was held down by he parents on the sofa, a plastic bag was stuffed into her mouth, they put her hands over her hands and nose so she was effectively being suffocated and the children who were all present watched their parents kill their sister.  “She described in great detail how Shafilea kicked her legs and how actually as she was losing control she urinated on the sofa. “Just the detail of how she saw her sister die was so compelling that it was quite clear she was telling the truth about what she had seen. The trial was already underway when police were contacted by Shahin. Ms Morris said: “She thought she had information which would be useful to the police investigating the case. By this time the trial was well underway. “The police met with Shahin and she told them that she had been so impressed by her courage in coming forward to give evidence that she felt she wanted to tell the police what she knew.” The judge then called Mevish as a witness, but she stayed loyal to her parents, claiming the story had been made up and was just an exercise in “creative writing”.

The security video shows a visibly-dishevelled Assange wearing a vest and shorts with his trademark long blond hair as he attempts to ride a skateboard round his dingy quarters. A female companion, believed to be advisor Stella Morris, watches on in the strange footage obtained by Spanish newspaper El Pais . Last week, the WikiLeaks founder was dragged kicking and screaming from the embassy in London, where he had barricaded himself on diplomatic refuge for fear of being arrested. He fears he could be extradited to face charges in the US, where federal prosecutors are investigating WikiLeaks. He could face up to five years in US prison.  Assange appeared in court last Thursday and  was found guilty of skipping bail in . He faces a jail sentence of up to  months when he is sentenced at Crown Court. He will next appear at Westminster Magistratesapos Court on May  by prison video-link in relation to the extradition case. It comes amid allegations from a Spanish security company hired by Ecuador to guard the Australian that he secretly spied on his Ecuadorian hosts.  Guards who worked for Undercover Global S.L said Assange would run the tap for fear British secret intelligence could be trying to listen in on his conversations in collusion with Ecuador. Listening devices were found inside Assangeaposs quarters - and when questioned by the Ecuadorian ambassador, his answers reportedly seemed “evasive”. Video monitors, a video recorder and also cooking equipment were installed in his quarters, which guards called The Batcave.  For months Assange had been trying legal action against the Ecuadorian government, accusing the South American nation of violating his rights by introducing strict house rules for living at the London embassy. Ecuador for their part believe the man known as The Guest was trying to hack the former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa. Ecuador finally gave him up, stripping his right to asylum before he was then found guilty of breaching bail in London last week.  It was believed the -year-oldaposs mental state was deteriorating the longer he was in the embassy - and was accused of smearing faeces all over the walls as guards grew annoyed at his hygiene and eating habits . Assange has been pursued by US authorities since  when he was involved in one of the biggest leaks in US government history - he has terried of the US coming after him ever since. But he has also been pursued on allegations of rape and sexual assault from  in Sweden, whose government are trying to extradite him. Assange denies the sexual assault and rape allegations."},{"url":null,"title":"man gets two offers bargain","story":"NewsMan gets two offers for bargain home - where he wants to live rent-freePeter Yielding, , wants £, less than neighbouring houses go for but the new owners will have to put up with himShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  APR NewsPeter Yielding is selling off his house for cheap, complete with a very special and surprising feature - himself \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man has slashed the price of his house by £, on condition he can live there rent-free after it sells. Peter Yielding, , wants just £, for his semi, which is in a street where the last house sold for £,. Despite his bizarre request, Peter says he has already had two “firm offers” for the house in St Albans, Herts. The listing on property site Rightmove says it has a garage and driveway and would be perfect for investors. But it also states: “The current vendor would like to remain at the property rent free as a long term tenant.”    Peter, who put the house on the market in February, said: “I just need the money. I’ll live here as a tenant.” The last house to sell on his street went for £, in January and another fetched £, last September. Some social media users mocked the advert, saying Peter should have been “laughed out of the estate agents”. But others described his offer as a “bargain” and predicted investors would be happy with the unusual catch.    One wrote: “This is possibly not as ridiculous as it first appears. £k is substantially less than what that gaff is worth. “I’d take on a long-term tenant for around £,, or whatever the dference in value is.” Leafy St Albans was recently voted the top commuter city for people working in London. The practice is called “home reversion” - where you sell all or part of your house in a cut-price deal. In exchange the buyer allows you to keep living there until you die or move into care. The older you are when you sell, the higher the percentage you will get of your home’s market value. This can work well for both parties but it can come back to bite buyersthe seller lives in their s or s.  In the most infamous example Andre-Francois Raffray agreed a knock-down price to buy -year-old Jean Calment’s flat in Arles, France. The -year-old lawyer signed a ‘viager’ deal in  to pay her £-a-month while she was still living in the property. Unfortunately for Mr Raffray, Mrs Calment ended up living another  years, becoming the world’s oldest woman. She outlived the new owner of her apartment, who paid more than double the flat’s value before his death in  aged . Mrs Calment died aged  in .

Mizz Enigma UK says people of all walks of le come to her Billingham terrace, demanding to be abused, humiliated and dominated. Men and women come alone, or as couples where they watch as their other half is battered and beaten. But the mum says it is nothing like  Shades of Grey and says there is no skin to skin contact. Among her regulars are a transvestite, a human pony and a -year-old who loves tickle torture.Teesside Live was invited to tour the -year-oldaposs playroom and hear all about her bizarre services.   Enigma inflicts pain using an astounding collection of specially-crafted batons, whips and canes - with some handmade creations worth thousands. Some people go to bingo. I just like to beat people up for a bit of fun, she told Teesside Live. Iaposm not embarrassed at all. Clients include everyone from a high-flying barrister to a client trying to get by on benefits. She refuses to see anyone under under , and until recently looked after adult babies. Now Iaposm going to be a nana, I decided to stop that one, she said. It just feels a bit too weird.    Almost every fetish and desire can be catered for - a stint in the stocks, time inside a dog cage or shocks from a Victorian electrocution kit. Her favourite treatments though are too gruelling, painful and graphic to publish in detail. I wait for them to say aposno, stop!apos she said. But they never do. The mum, originally from Dormanstown, insists she strictly does not offer sexual services. The neighbours think Iaposm on the game, she said. But I donapost give any extra services at all. That’s the rule I work by and I think itaposs why I am still in business  years on.  In fact, Engima always wears gloves, there is no skin to skin contact and she takes cross contamination very seriously - with a strict sterilising regime. Hour-long sessions are carefully-orchestrated scenes with her playing the starring role and her submissives as extras. Enigma’s attire during her sessions ranges from a classy business suit to lingerie - and always with a £ pair of high heels. Clients call her mistress and she is in control, but safety comes first. It’s about talking, trust and warming up. I always ask what is allowed or not allowed. There are safe words. Then it stops immediately. Thereaposs no repercussions. They donapost pay.  Enigma could get requests to do anything and everything. I donapost have to understand. I just work with it, she said. Everything stays between four walls. She added: It makes me really belly laugh. Itaposs hilarious. Itaposs just funny, it really is. Some actually like being laughed at. They want to be humiliated. I donapost always laugh in their face. ButI can get away with it, I have a good chuckle. But despite her often brutal treatments, Enigma insists she is not a violent person. Someone who does this would not last two minutesthey were doing it for violence, she said. I care for my slaves. Itaposs not about what I want. Itaposs about serving their needs.  Feelings of depression, doubt and self-loathing, known as sub drop, are common after the sessions. Aftercare is vitally important, with Enigma always checking they are stable in their body and mind before releasing them. She said: I canapost just beat them up and kick them out. Iaposll reassure them and give them a cuddle. In the kitchen she keeps the worldaposs best first aid kit to deal with physical damage. Luckily Enigma has avoided a major medical emergency this far, except one unfortunate episode which led to a trip to AE. The mum first started BDSM at the age of , but it only became her full time profession in December. Before this, she worked in Bargain Buys.  She now effectively lives for free, with lestyle slaves paying her rent and utility bills and completing most of her household chores. Enigmaaposs churchgoing mum and four kids, aged in their teens and twenties, are all aware of her unusual career. They honestly donapost care, she said. They know what mam does. They know mam is safe in what sheaposs doing. I have brought them up to be non-judgmental. She keeps her personal le closely guarded, but tells us she enjoys her own private BDSM sessions: I take the pain. I donapost give out what I canapost take. Enigma’s services are openly advertised on the internet and she has nothing to hide.  Iaposm here to be me, she said. I’m not going to pretend to be something Iaposm not. I’m not on benefits. I’m not stealing from the state. I’m supporting myself. I’m not ashamed in any way. Iaposm not doing anything illegal.She sees her work as a vital service: Some of the people who see me, itaposs their only outlet. Itaposs their only release. They don’t want a relationship with anyone. I am not in a relationship. Itaposs just a bit of fun. Itaposs adults wanting fun. Her living room dungeon only opened a month ago and is a work in progress. But she already has plans for a special slaves entrance, en-suite facilities and a special cell under the stairs. And she is always encouraging new kinky clients to enter the dungeon for the first time. Donapost be ashamed of who you are, she said. Be open and honest. Iaposm not here to judge anyone. If you think youaposve got a new kink, you havenapost. I will have seen it before.

Teacher Gillian Sykes found out she had cancer in January and is preparing to have a double mastectomy operation in the summer, Liverpool Echo reports .She has had to quit work as a supply teacher but says she has been left to aposfight for survivalapos with the Department of Work and Pensions. Gillian explained how she has been turned down for support and was even made to take bank statements into the job centre just two days after her first draining bout of chemotherapy. She said she also had money taken away because of the DWP made mistakes over dates - and was eventually left with just p to live on, forcing her to rely on hand-outs from family and friends. Have you faced hardship because of Universal Credit  If so contact Mirror online at webnews@trinitymirror    Gillian was also told she needed to be looking for work - which the DWP later said was just an aposautomated response.apos The -year-old, who lives in Ashton-in-Makerfield with her two teenage children, spoke about the devastating moment she discovered she had cancer. She said: I found the lump myself on the th December when I was going to bed - and I cried myself to sleep. Weaposve got a family history of it - its the th anniversary of my mumaposs death this year. I was in an absolute panic and got an appointment shortly after - then two weeks later I was sent to see an oncologist who confirmed what I already knew, that it wasnapost a cyst, it was a solid mass. A week later I got given the news and things progressed quite quickly from there. Iaposve now had three rounds of chemotherapy. My hair is coming out in handfuls daily. This summer I will be having as double mastectomy - which is not nice. Gillian began a y, draining battle with the Department of Work and Pensions to get the benefits she needed to help her through an incredibly dficult time.    After her cancer diagnosis, Gillian said she was never told she qualied for Limited Capability for Work Related Activity - which is supposed to provide extra cash for those who are unable to work. She was left battling with the department for weeks in a bid to get the extra support. Gillian said: To be going through that is enough, only to then to deal with this - after paying into a system as a teacher system that I desperately need help from. Iaposm having battles left, right and centre with Universal Credit - and issues with not being told what I can and canapost claim. Iaposve had more support from Macmillan nurses than the government. Two days after my first chemotherapy session, I was told I had to take my bank statements in to the job centre to prove that they had taken money from me that they shouldnapost have. Iaposve had statutory sickpay penalised - I complained and complained. I spoke to a dferent person on the phone every time. I just feel like Iaposm fighting for survival with benefits, that I shouldnapost be fighting with right now. Iaposve got enough stress.  After spending weeks waiting to find outshe could get the vital extra LCWRA payments, Gillian decided to apply for what is known as a Universal Credit budgeting loan - used to help those who are struggling. She said: This particular month was really hard, I rang them to be told by someone that nothing was available to me because aposall the buttons were greyed out - and we donapost know why. Someone  told me nothing was available because I had earned at least £, in the last six months - well of course I did, Iaposm a teacher, I was working full time with my agency up until Christmas - so Iaposve been punished for actually going to work. What I do get from Universal Credit, Iaposm paying a mortgage, Iaposve got two kids. I didnapost expect this to happen to me. I have suffered with depression for several years, which has been greatly under control and I have been able to work - and this is now whataposs happening on a daily basis when I find out the next step, the next fight.  After she spoke to the Liverpool Echo, the Department of Work and Pensions told her she did in fact qualy for the extra cash. The following day she was told she would be backpaid hundreds of pounds that were owed to her, and an apology from the DWP followed. A spokesman told the ECHO: We have apologised to Gillian Sykes for the distress caused by this delay and are paying her full arrears. She has been placed in the long-term health condition group, meaning she receives a higher level of support and will not be required to seek work. “We want to ensure that anyone with a health condition gets the support they need, which is why the Government is rolling out a recovery package to support people diagnosed with cancer and over , people will benefit every year by .” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince george princess charlotte cousin","story":"NewsPrince George, Princess Charlotte and cousin Mia enjoy funfair rides togetherDuke and Duchess of Cambridge and Mike Tindall kept a close eye on their Royal offspring at the Burnham Market horse trials as Zara competedShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsPrince George enjoyed playing at the fair with sister Charlotte and cousin Mia\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal cousins Prince George and Mia Tindall show that the going is fair on this family day out.

Temperatures in Britain could be warmer than hotspots such as Barcelona and Majorca over the holiday, bringing a welcome end to weeks of Scandinavian cold and rain. The weather will improve throughout the week to give a dry and warm bank holiday weekend throughout much of the country, according to the Met Office. Forecaster Simon Partridge said Good Friday will be pleasant and the mercury will rise to exceed C in areas on Saturday and Easter Sunday.    But clouds could usher in some cooler temperatures in the North West and some parts of the east coast. Monday will be dry, bright and less cold, the Met Office said, while the far west and southwest will see rain and gales at times. Monday night will be milder than recent nights and mostly frost free. On Tuesday, rain will spread into western Scotland, the Midlands and southern England.  But from Wednesday it will be largely dry with plenty of sunshine. Mr Partridge said: After there was a chilly spell this weekend, we are going to see temperatures gradually increase through the week. By the weekend we could see in parts of the country temperatures of around C, or just above. The warm weather was forecast for south of England as well as western Scotland and the north west of England.    Temperatures have plunged below freezing in the north in recent days, hitting -C in places. They will climb into the s on Good Friday and could hit C, the Met Office said, while the Spanish island of Majorca and Barcelona are forecast to see highs of about C with cloud cover and rain. Met Office five-day weather forecast Monday Many areas will be dry, bright and less cold. Colder and cloudier in the far west and southwest, with rain and strong winds at times, perhaps with gales in exposure. Also cloudy in northeast, with some showers possible.

Lisa had initially thought she was suffering from the flu, but a few trips to the doctors couldnapost figure out what was wrong.    Then one day, around a year ago, things took a turn for the worse.Rory told Teesside Live : I had gone to bed, she woke me up in the early hours saying she couldnapost breathe,Her heart rate was absolutely crazy. Next thing you know she was getting rushed into resuscitation. I knew things were getting pretty serious then. Then they decided to move her to the high dependency unit. She spent the day and night in there. As her condition worsened, Rory was given the devastating news that his we needed to be put into a coma. But, thankfully, after five days in the coma and a further four spent at James Cook University Hospital, Lisa has now made a full recovery. It was concluded that she had undiagnosed asthma which was made worse by an infection.    Rory added: Without the team of specialist consultants, doctors, nurses and other support staff, she simply would not be here. The NHS does get some stick at times, blame the government not the employees. They are simply professionals, and go above and beyond their call of duty. I’d like to make more people aware of how asthma can easily reduce a fit and healthy person to be very seriously ill. I’d also like to raise awareness of the fantastic work the employees of the NHS do.To thank staff at the hospital and also raise funds for Asthma UK, Mr Spence, a production manager, is set to battle through the pain caused by arthritis in his hips and run the London Marathon later this month. The funds will be shared equally between the charity and James Cook Hospital, you can find out more on his fundraising page ."},{"url":null,"title":"woman tells council shed rather","story":"NewsWoman tells council shed rather die than remove her living room fireplaceMrs Jenner, from Tiverton in Devon, said she has not got a back burner and it was nonsense to have the fireplace removedShareCommentsByLewis ClarkeTfany Lo:,  APR NewsMrs Jenner was told to remove the fireplace in the front room due to safety reasons \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has been left devastated after being told by the local council that she must remove the fireplace from her front room.

Seriously.An unnamed woman has claimed her heavily pregnant bridesmaid upstaged her at the wedding before ruining the ceremony and helping to out her brother as gay. Itaposs a lot to take in.  The woman, who goes by the username aposIgnoredBrideapos, revealed all in a post on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum. She starts by telling her fellow users that sheaposs been married for one and a half months and the big day took a whopping three years to plan.Everything was going well with the wedding planning, until one of her bridesmaids discovered she wasnapost going to be getting a plus one. She explained: We had six people on each side of the bridal party. When I got engaged, most of the bridesmaid were single, including Anna, the star of this story.    I just wanted to give the two partnered bridesmaids plus ones, Anna seemed offended by this, because my wedding was then years off. Eventually got pushed by my mother to give all of them plus ones. Anna married four months before my wedding at two months pregnant. She brought her new husband as a plus one and convinced one of the other bridesmaids to take her friend as hers . And this is only the tip of the ice berg.She continues: [Anna] was hugely pregnant, and didnapost refrain from showing it off. Weaposre both fairly youngand in my husbandaposs culture, getting pregnant before late s s, married or not, is basically a teenage pregnancy and drew ATTENTION.The woman claims that all anyone could talk about during the wedding was Annaaposs pregnancy and her electric personality, which left the bride feeling upstaged.    When [Anna and her husband] got up to dance, all eyes were on them. Annaaposs friend ended up hooking up with my brother, outing him as gay and causing a huge scandal, she wrote. I ended up leaving midway through the reception in tears, and never attended the next morningaposs brunch. I canapost even look at the pictures without crying and desperately want a do-over. She goes on to reveal that the big day cost over £, and she feels like Anna owes her another wedding for what she did.    Iaposm not a bridezilla, she added, But this was beyond the pale. It felt like a celebration of Annaaposs marriage. Iaposm sorry but I put so much planning, effort and money into this while someone that got pregnant without a thought and married spur of the moment reaped the benefits. I honestly feel like Anna owes me a wedding and did all of this for revenge for me offending her years ago. More than  people have commented on the post, with many people slamming the bride. One person wrote: You are the a**hole and I donapost even know where to begin to explain why. Another replied: Itaposs not Annaaposs fault she decided to live her le. Your planning spanned three years without any consideration OR expectation of possible changes within the people involved. You are  percent a bridezilla.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields south ayrshrie council","story":"NewsBob Shields: South Ayrshrie Council need new plan to build hundreds of homesRiiverside flats face being pulled downShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’ve dominated Ayr’s skyline for exactly half a century. They’re aesthetically unappealing, architecturally worthless and my three year old grandson could probably knock up an exact replica in Lego while his left hand was peeling the foil off his Easter egg. Carbuncles, eyesores, blots on the landscape - you can call them what you like. But for a couple of hundred people at least . . . it’s the place that they call ‘home’. Last week, South Ayrshire Council started the first phase of what could end in the demolition of Ayr’s trident of riverside flats. Officials began door knocking at Riverside Place as part of the promised consultation with the remaining residents to help decide whether the flats should be renovated . . . or simply razed to the ground. By all accounts – including my dear old  year old dad – the housing staff were considerate and sympathetic while listening to everyone’s point of view. And while the many senior citizens at Riverside didn’t exactly link their arms defiantly and chant “We shall not be moved” – they left the consultants with a similar but equally strong message - “We don’t want to be moved . . .” This leaves South Ayrshire Council between three, fourteen storey blocks – and a hard place. The flats all need “core” work to their internal cladding which has reached “the end of its design le”. To simply ignore the advice of the independent structural engineers isn’t an option. In this post-Grenfell era, the words “cladding” and “tower block” make even the pencils on a health and safety officer’s desk stand to attention. But with an estimated price tag of £ million for the renovations, South Ayrshire Council must balance whether saving Riverside Place is best value compared to simply knocking them down and starting a new-build site. They next conundrum for SAC is then the poser – is best value always best practice  Re-housing – and I mean satisfactorily re-housing – what is likely to be at least  people is a decant operation of Normandy proportions. Personally, I don’t think old Bob Snr is physically or mentally equipped to be transferred anywhere. And there must be dozens - or even scores - just like him at Riverside Place. A good place for SAC to start would be to put hundreds of minds at rest and pledge ‘no compulsory transfers’ out of Riverside Place. And after that . . . work out how the heck they can achieve it! Getting the number of tenants down to  – enough to fill two blocks – would be my starting point. Decanting from one block to a similar flat in another is the least intrusive option. I don’t like the phrase ‘natural wastage’ – but it can’t be ignored. Like anywhere  in the world, Riverside Place will have its share of residents who pass on to a much higher level than fourteen floors. I’ve also spoken to several residents who would seriously consider a temporary move to other parts of Ayr – in exchange for a ‘rent free’ package. Yep – it’s called bribery . . . but it could work. And it would mean work do be done to one block at a time – with residents moving between the two that are habitable. However,the final decision is to demolish Riverside Place, it’s a whole new ball game. Butthis really is the ‘pivotal point for Ayr town centre’ that everyone is talking about – it’s the ideal time for SAC to come up with a new local authority housing plan to build hundreds of new homes over the next few years. And finally, let’s not forget the third option. Empty the flats . . . surround them in scaffolding . . . cover them in white plastic . . . and forget about them!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"coral scottish grand national festival","story":"NewsCoral Scottish Grand National Festival set to welcome thousands to AyrMore than , race fans will attend the track over the course of the two day festival.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsRace fans are set for a great time at Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe stage is set for Ayr’s busiest weekend of  – the Coral Scottish Grand National Festival, writes Iain Ferguson.

Tory John Scott MSP has called on the SNP to deflect funding into putting more police in Ayrshire. He: “We should all recognise the professional job done by police officers in what are undoubtedly extremely challenging circumstances, but the reality is that job is made much harder by the lack of adequate resources . At the Scottish Police Federation’s annual conference held at Turnberry, the concern was that there was just not enough officers on the frontline. It’s clear the Scottish Government needs to give our police a greater share of resources, so they can do the job of keeping us all safe.” The survey asked Ayrshire peopletheir local bobbies patrol on foot - and only . per cent said yes. This figure has more than halved in the last five years. Nearly  per cent said they had seen police bicycle patrols in their area, and . per cent by car.

The public have been advised to stay away from the area and nearby residents should keep their windows closed. Crews are working alongside the Forestry Commission and Police Scotland and will remain on scene until the area is made safe. A rest and welfare facility has been established in the community centre in Dalmellington for any local residents affected by the fire. Assistant Chief Officer for Response and Resilience Lewis Ramsay said: “Our crews across Scotland have had a challenging weekend attending numerous incidents. “Due to the outstanding collaborative working with land owners, The Forestry Commission and Police Scotland we have been able to ensure the safety of our communities. “I would like to thank the wider community for their ongoing support, the hard work of our partners, and the crews on the ground for their tireless efforts.” Firefighters are also still in attendance at a wildfire at Paul’s Hill wind farm near Aberlour. A number of fire engines were mobilised to the area after the call came in at .pm on Saturday, April . A wildfire warning was issued in conjunction with the Scottish Wildfire Forum for this weekend. Wild and grass fires can start by the careless disposal of cigarettes and barbecues or campfires left unattended.They then have the potential to burn for days and devastate vast areas of land, wildle and threaten the welfare of nearby communities - swallowing up emergency service resources. SFRS Area Manager Bruce Farquharson is the chair of the Scottish Wildfire Forum. He said: We saw last year the devastating effect wildfires can have on communities and wildle. The dry and warm weather we are currently experiencing means there is a heightened risk of wildfire across the country. Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can cause signicant environmental and economic damage. Livestock, farmland, wildle, protected woodland and sites of special scientic interest can all be devastated by these fires - as can the lives of people living and working in rural communities. The SFRS works closely with land managers, communities and other safety partners to prevent these incidents ever occurring. Area Manager Farquharson continued: At the start of spring there is often a lot of dead vegetation leftover from last year - this fuel can dry out quickly with higher temperatures and lower humidity levels. A great many people will be enjoying the outdoors in the good weather this weekend, we urge everyone to make sure that they don’t increase the chance of wildfire – be aware of the risks and follow the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Wildfires are a major threat to our wildle and wild places. We encourage people visiting the outdoors to be extra careful, and check the advice in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code before starting a fire. The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

Middlemede Properties Ltd, who own the Upper Pavilion fishing beat adjacent to the proposed Lowood development, was presented to SBC chiefs months before the council purchased the land for pound.

It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects.

Irsquom not yet really old, as Irsquom still in my s, but relative to how young I used to be, Irsquom old by any measure I used in my days of youth.And there seem few benefits in getting older.As one friend recently told me, ldquoIf, at our age, you donrsquot have a pain or ache somewhere, then yoursquore probably deid.But I think there is a tipping point in all this getting old process, whereby you stop resisting the idea, and not only accept it, but embrace it. I think I have reached that point.My age has become a kind of achievement given my lestyle, and I have a deep recognition that every day is something to savour, even when, as is the case as I now write, the weather outside is cold, wet and just miserable.And storytelling is a profession in which getting older is not seen as a disadvantage, because oldness in a storyteller can add a bit more authenticity.But my storytelling profession also highlights my disconnection to what people call progress. Increasingly in my work with children, I am being made aware of the gap between what is going on in technological developments and my knowledge of it.Often in accounts of daily le, things are mentioned by children and I have absolutely no idea what they are. Usually they are new computer games or computer technology.These games are so much part of so many childrenrsquos lives that when I ask what they are they find it incredible that I have no knowledge of them.One of them responded cheekily, but in an affectionate manner, ldquoTim do you live in a cave In a sense I suppose I do. I am lucky to have a young family as well as a grown up one, and that keeps me young at heart. But so far I have managed to resist the computer game thing, although I know how addictive it can be because I recently I tried a game once in a friendrsquos house.I felt a bit like Frodo Baggins when he put on the ring. Something took over my soul and for a moment I was being taken over by an uncontrollable desire. I didnrsquot actually say the words ldquomy precious screen when I was forced to leave, but that is how I felt.In one way, my lack of experience with this kind of technology makes me feel old and disconnected from the modern world but, on the other hand, it makes me feel relieved and even privileged that I grew up in an age when such toxic distractions from living le were simply not available.I remember climbing trees, mucking about at the beach, playing in the garden till it got dark, making dens, cycling on an old bike that had been thrown away, going round for pals basically being almost constantly outside and usually dirty when I finally came home. No wonder children assume there was no electricity in the days of my youth, because when I describe it, there is an absence of devices.I did, of course, watch TV, but programmes were limited, no morning TV for example, and childrenrsquos TV was over by teatime. The outdoors was ldquomy precious and being bored was a motivation to make a game with pals not switch on a screen.Only now, looking back, do I realise just how much a privilege it was to have a childhood free of this screen addiction. It simply wasnrsquot an option so there was no sense of loss or missing out.But now with a young family I wonder how much longer I can hold out.After a trip to North Berwick the other day I was asked by my youngest daughter, ldquoWhat are those things on the seat  as she peered into a car parked next to ours at a supermarket car park.They were the frame holdersfor ipads, so the children can watch films or play games while in the car. I realised my daughter had no idea that such a thing was possible!I explained how it was much better to sing songs, tell stories, play word games and look out the window and play ldquoI spy. She nodded her head, but Irsquom not sure she was convinced.I know Irsquom coming across as an old self righteous dinosaur. I do realise, of course, that the ldquogood old days were not all good.I also understand that kids, indeed le itself, can be hard work, and all this new technology can help make our lives easier. It can help us keep us entertained and connected in a dferent way, and make information easier to get.But even still, when children look at me in horror when I explain the absence of technology in my childhood and they ask me, ldquobut what did you do, I feel a sense of sadness that we have allowed the giants of IT multinationals to steal the imaginations, and the precious childhood time, of our children and future generations.In that sense I think storytellers are needed perhaps more than ever. I remain happy living in my ldquocave. And when it is finally time for my own lights to go out, I hope I will have left a trail of stories and experiences.In the end, surely, that legacy is worth more than a thousand computer games played."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious-plans-revealed-for-the-bell","story":"Kurt Edwards and Laura McSweeney will step behind the bar at The Bell next month, with plans for a fresh outlook and a name change.Mr Edwards and Miss McSweeney are behind Eats on the Green, which handles catering at Haddington Golf Club, with Graeme Flick set to become head chef at the pub, which was previously The Railway Hotel.Thirty-eight-year-old Mr Edwards said: ldquoWe have got children and we found there was a need for a family pub in East Lothian.ldquoWe had been going to The Pine Marten in Dunbar but there was nowhere for us take the children.ldquoI spoke to Greene Kingand we came up with the idea to put in a play area upstairs and they were all for it.The trio will officially be handed the keys on April  and will put in a new till system and run the business until the end of the month.Then, the final bell will toll for The Bell, with a new name of The Green when the business reopens.Mr Edwards said there would be a similar outlook at the Court Street business as to their business at the golf club, with an emphasis on ldquoworking with local suppliers, everything made in house and tasty food.He added: ldquoWe are going to lose the big screen television upstairs.ldquoIt was just not working and we are going to get a couple of screens downstairs.ldquoUpstairs will be more of a family environment and we are going to change the bar and add a coffee machine.ldquoThere will be cakes and sweet stuff, plus alcohol.ldquoDownstairs will be more of a pub and we will have a food offering sothere is a game on you can get a pint and a meal during the game.A spokeswoman for Greene King wished the new parties well.She said: ldquoWersquore thrilled that Kurt and Laura have agreed to take on The Bell and we wish them all the best with their new venture.ldquoWe made a signicant investment in this pub in recent years and wersquove spent time recruiting the right partners who we believe can take the pub forward and continue to ensure its success at the heart of Haddington.Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Councillor Tom Trotter also wished those involved the best of luck.He said: ldquoYou go further down the street and see what has happened to some of the pubs.ldquoHopefully, they get a turn and make a success of it.Meanwhile, The Victoria Inn, which is also owned by Greene King, remains on the market after a potential buyer fell through."},{"url":null,"title":"20km-diversion-may-drive-you-crazy","story":"A km stretch of the B at Mayshiel, south east of Gford,will be shut for three days from Monday to allowcarriageway resurfacing to take place.The ersion route takes drivers on a km tour through East Lothian villages, includingGarvald and Gford, beforerejoining the road west of Mayshiel.The B passing the entrance to Mayshiel Farm.

You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

No matter what anybody says, women would not compete with men at Wimbledon or at the Olympicsit was open to both sexes, just because of the physicality.\"That does not take away from the fact that womens sport is technically very good and exciting to watch. And it is good to see our teams compete at the highest level.\"Male footballers, moreover, he said. should learn from the womenrsquos game on how to be aggressive without cheating.He said: ldquoWhen I was at the SFA I brought in the retrospective punishment for cheating - or simulation as they call it.

But it has never been seen here on a large scale.However, there is a history of birch water in Scotland going back millennia. Rob, whose company Birken Tree collects around , litres of sap each year, says: ldquoWe trace it back at least , years. There was a Neolithic lady whose body was dug up in Caithness where I am from and there was evidence of some food and some of that was birch sap. In the Highlands there are records of people using it as a tonic after a long winter giving it to babies, themselves and even cattle. It makes sense because it is so full of minerals and vitamins and it is a lean period .Although still known about in other countries Rob says there could be a simple reason its use died out here. ldquoThey have a very dferent history to us in Scotland. People were cleared away to the New World and that connection to the land was severed.Sat amid the birch trees of Grandtully Forest in Perthshire, Rob explains the unique taste: ldquoI like the silkiness of it, almost creamy. There is a very slight sweetness, depending on the tree or the season. Some people compare it to melons or cucumber, it is very subtle.When they first tapped the sap last year Gabrielle said she was ldquoexcited: ldquoWe realised the taste of fresh sap was dferent from the bottle we had before ndash we really loved it. That is why we use glass bottles to keep the taste right. And,you warm it up slightly the flavours are more intense.There is usually only a three week window to gather the sap in spring because as the warmer months arrive it develops a bitter taste.However, the season has been is longer this year though because the warmer weather in February meant they started in the second week of March.They collect about , litres a year but estimate that each tree only loses a tiny amount of its sap. Rob says: ldquoWe take about one per cent. We know they take up s of litres a day and we take about five.Gabrielle gave up a job as a chiropractor to concentrate on the business. And while Rob still works as a forester he aims to concentrate on their start up business full-time.Internationally, the market is worth millions of dollars and Gabrielle and Rob were introduced to it when a friend gave them a bottle marked ldquoMade in Finland.Gabrielle says: ldquoWe thought someone must make it in Scotland but no. As a result, they became the only Scottish producers on a commercial level, selling to local delicatessens and through a wholefood distributor.Gabrielle adds: ldquoThere are lots of vitamins and minerals, enzymes and amino acids. There is xylitol as well which is good for the teeth.ldquoA lot of people askit iswater because it is called birch water but no, it is pure sap.The sap ferments in three days so they freeze it and then pasteurise it a little to give it a longer shelf le.Rob says: ldquoAt some point it would be nice to focus on it full time and we have launched a crowdfunding campaign. Growing the business will mean adding flavours such as cranberry, bilberry and meadowsweet and also creating sparkling birch water which has been asked for by high end hotels and restaurants.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, , has written about birch water on her Facebook page saying the ldquonutrient-dense liquid is a ldquohero ingredient.Despite the trendy, modern feel to the product Rob insists its , year history means what they are doing is ldquonothing new. He adds: ldquoWhat we are saying is lsquohello, you should be drinking this stuffrsquo.Hayley Bruce, Commercial Marketing Intelligence Manager at Scotland Food  Drink, said: ldquoScotland has a rich heritage when it comes to food and drink production and it is great to see traditional techniques being adopted in the modern world.

Not only was this a national humiliation, and a breach of promise, it has cost nearly pound.bn in No Deal preparations that had to be cancelled.Whatever happened to ldquoNo Deal is Better than a Bad Deal  Or the PMs insistence that holding European elections would be ldquoutterly unacceptable. Has a prime minister ever in history been so wrong so often and yet remained in office  I cant think of one. Theresa Mays staying power is formidable and has become a political force in itself. They used to say that, after a nuclear war, the only ones left would be cockroaches and the indestructible chanteuse, Cher. But Theresa May will still be there too, lecturing insect le on the merits of her Withdrawal Agreement.While she remains in office, nothing can really change. Indeed, the six month stay of execution on Brexit, awarded by the European Union last week, almost guarantees that nothing will change. The pressure is off. Negotiations with Labour over the customs union will surely stall. Brussels wont reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and neither will the DUP and Tory hard liners accept it. Theresa May is still blocking a Peoples Vote, about which Jeremy Corbyn is anyway distinctly cool.The European Elections are going to be an unavoidable nightmare for both the big parties. The Tories will suffer mass defections from disgruntled No Dealers. Labour will likely be torn apart over its manesto. The membership will want to include a Peoples Vote, which many Labour MPs, especially in northern English seats, will bitterly oppose.The new independent party, Change UK, will try to syphon of disgruntled Labour and Tory Remain voters, and could do quite well. Six million peopled have signed the parliamentary petition calling for Article  to be Revoked and they will want to turn the European elections into a proxy referendum. But the Tiggers will be fighting for votes with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.One consolation is that the Brexit right is split also. Under Nigel Farage, Ukip came out top in the  EU elections and even won a seat in Scotland. On Friday, Mr Farage, launched his own rival political vehicle, the Brexit Party, following Ukips lurch to the Tommy Robinson far right.Thats going to be confusing for Leavers because Ukip is an established political brand. But it was essentially the Nigel Farage party, so it seems likely that his new Brexit Party could succeed in being the natural destination for hard Brexiteers. By the same token, moderate Tories will not want to touch anything led by Nigel Farage and will probably not vote at all.The one party which should do well hands down in the European elections is the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon will happily hoover up the independence and Remain votes. Labour has stalled badly in Scotland under Richard Leonard, and the Tories are indelibly tarnished by the behaviour of Theresa May and the Brexit right. Were the six Scottish MEPs to be elected on first past the post, the SNP might well have swept the board come May rd. But the European elections are conducted under a strict version of PR, so the SNP target will probably be to increase from two seats to three.After the European Elections, Theresa May, assuming she is still there , will presumably try to put her deal to parliament for a fourth time, or seek to have the Withdrawal Deal ratied by other procedural means, given that the Speaker has blocked a fourth Meaningful Vote. This will almost certainly fail, and a war-torn parliament will collapse into the long summer recess with ill-disguised relief.Nothing ever happens in Brussels over the Summer months, so discussions with Europe will stall, and in the autumn the EU will be pre-occupied with installing a new President of the European Council, replacing Donald Tusk, and a new President of the European Commission, replacing Jean Claude Juncker. This discontinuity means Brexit is in danger of falling into black hole of indecision. Europe is fed up with Britains Brexit psychodrama, and just want us to go away.Back in the UK, the run up to the latest Brexit deadline on Halloween, st October , will be by the UK party conferences. Both Labour and the Conservatives will be hopelessly ided. There will be harsh words in Labour between supporters of Mr Corbyns managed Brexit and supporters of a Peoples Vote who constitute the majority of Labour activists, especially the younger ones.The Tories will be even more ided at their party conference in October. The pro-Brexit representatives of the Tory grass roots will have their first opportunity to vent their collective frustration at the leadership, and Theresa May in particular. Andshe still tries to promote her deal, which is loathed by the hard Brexit Tory membership, she will be roasted by representatives who are in a state of incipient rebellion.The PM will almost certainly come out of the Tory conference having had to harden her Brexit negotiating position against the customs union compromise. Liam Fox the International Trade Secretary, has told the Tory backbench  Committee that a customs union is incompatible with Brexit and that Britain would be ldquostuck in the worst of both worlds.With her options closed off, and with the Halloween deadline approaching, Theresa May will be left trying to run down the clock as before. Presumably parliament will again intervene to vote against hard Brexit. So the PM may have to go back to Brussels, cap in hand, on November st asking for another extension. Brussels will hum and haw about this, and no doubt Emanuel Macron and Angela Merkel will continue their bad-cop-good-cop routine, before stling their giggles and giving the UK yet another stay of execution.This time it might be permanent because the May government would surely fall, and there would be a general election. I know that I said as much last time, but there must be a limit to Theresa Mays ability to struggle on in the face adversity. The DUP and the hard Brexiteers of the ERG are incorrigible.She cannot get her Withdrawal Deal through parliament and she cannot strike a deal with Labour without destroying her own party. In Chess this is called a Zugzwang, when the king has to make a move, even though every option makes the situation worse.

Many rushed forward in yet another vain attemptto retake Tahrir Square from government opposition supporters who had turned the central Cairo landmark into the epicentre of their revolution.As daylight broke, these same opposition supporters who had camped in the bitter cold overnight repelling the onslaught, rose to face another day of stand-offs and fighting. So too did the soldiers of the Egyptian army, whose tanks and personnel carriers sat in the square as calls for a crackdown against the opposition grew.The opposition billed it as the ldquoDay of Departure, and as the early morning sounds of the muezzinrsquos call to prayer reverberated across the city, the calls for Mubarak to go also grew louder. ldquoDown with the regime, they chanted over and again.Those were heady and violent days back in  when I witnessed the overthrow of Mubarak. But they were also days too of hope for those who sought political change, as the early salvoes of the Arab Spring uprising reverberated in Egypt just as they had in Tunisia weeks before and would in the months to come from Libya to Yemen, Syria to Bahrain.In the eight intervening years since those momentous times, many people have pronounced the hopes of the Arab Spring as being dead and buried. They are lost they say to the likes of the military rule that now prevails in Egypt or the ruins of Syriarsquos cities obliterated in the civil war that followed the uprising there.Then came those nine extraordinary days over the past week or so during which two of the Arab worldrsquos most entrenched autocrats were deposed.In Algeria and in Sudan, the departures of Presidents Abdelaziz Bouteflika and Omar al-Bashir both of whom weathered the turmoil of , has sent fresh shock waves across the Middle East and North Africa and given rise to talk of a new Arab Spring.Those massive crowds we have seen on the television news lately clamouring in Khartoum for the removal of President al-Bashir of Sudan, so evoke the crowds that gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo or outside the Tunisian interior ministry eight years ago. All of a sudden it appears that the popular uprisings of - were not the dead end many have portrayed them to be.But is what we are witnessing in Khartoum and Algiers, really the brewing of a new Arab Spring andso will the outcome be any dferent this time around According to Georges Fahmi, a research fellow on the Middle East programme at the Royal Institute of International Affairs , the straightforward answer to the first question is yes, eventhe final outcome of these latest protests is as yet unknown.ldquoThe  Arab uprisings had four main characteristics: they were nationwide, sustained over time, political in nature and interconnected. This new wave of protests ticks all of these four boxes, says Fahmi.He highlights the fact that in both Sudan and Algeria, for example, the ongoing protests have spread across dferent cities, including the capital cities of Algiers and Khartoum. Also that the protesters have been able so far, to sustain their activities for three months in Sudan and one month in Algeria.ldquoThis wave has also gone beyond socio-economic grievances to develop clear political demands evidenced by its slogans, lsquoJust fall that is allrsquo in Sudan and lsquoNo to the fth mandatersquo in Algeria, as well as other slogans borrowed from , explains Fahmi.For years leaders in countries like Sudan and Algeria have sought to stoke fear in their people and warned against such mobilisation in popular revolutions. The misery that ensued in places like Libya and Syria following the uprisings there in  has also been invoked as a deterrent.But what has become increasingly clear is that the root causes of these previous uprisings have not been addressed and continue to fester, making for a political timebomb among the populations of countries like Sudan and Algeria.Across swathes of North Africa especially, regimes there have imposed austerity measures, cutting food, energy and fuel subsidies. And just as joblessness has soared so too has living costs.Currently the Arab world has the worldrsquos highest youth unemployment rate, with about  per cent of  to -year-olds out of work.The World Bank predicts thatcurrent demographic trends persist, the Middle East and North Africa will need to create more than m jobs by .Just to keep up with the regionrsquos demographic bulge, the countries affected need to ldquocreate immediately more than m jobs a year, it warns.For the moment though what prevails in the lives of most people is a vicious cycle of being asked to do with less while political freedoms are increasingly restricted.Faced with such challenges, lessons from the past and whether they are heeded now is what will determine the final outcome of the present uprisings.Activists in Sudan and Algeria all say they are fighting to escape the fates of the Arab states that rose up in . All of those countries, except for Tunisia, have either plunged into chaos or reverted to authoritarianism.How ironic it is that back in Egypt in , Islamist activists worried openly about how to avoid what they called ldquothe Algeria scenario. Most being well aware that only twenty years earlier, Algerian generals had cancelled a parliamentary election to prevent an Islamist victory at the polls, and that for the next  years, the Algerian army and the Islamists fought a civil war that killed more than , people.Now Algerians are acutely aware of the need to avoid the \"Egyptian scenario\", whereby the army becomes the controlling body with all the repressive implications that could bring.Algeria after all is an institutionalised, multi-party state, run by a military and economic elite. These elite knows how to oppress the public, suppress criticism, lock up rivals and sometimes kill them, but are also aware of the publicrsquos power.When the moment came in the past few weeks to force President Bouteflikato resign, it was the army that pressured him to avoid confrontations with the public.In so doing of course the army allowed the elite to stay in power, something those on the streets of Algiers are determined should not persist. No point in getting rid of one authoritarian member of the old guard only to have him replaced by the countryrsquos opaque circles of generals and businessmen goes the protesters thinking.For years, Arab autocrats have relied on ldquosocial contracts to maintain stability, in effect using state pay-offs funded by petrodollars set against limited political freedom and this could still prove a dficult cycle to breakSome commentators and analysts remain sceptical that the current protesters are capable of ensuring this will happen.ldquoIf anyone insists on calling the moves in Algeria and Sudan the second chapter of the Arab Spring, they will have to make do with seeing it as the Arab Spring of the army and elites wishing to defend themselves, insisted Zvi Barrsquoel correspondent for the Israeli Daily newspaper Haaretz.ldquoThe publicrsquos awareness of its power was forged in the ldquooriginal Arab Spring, and this may be the most signicant achievement of these revolutions. But this awareness alone has not generated the real revolutions that will probably have to wait for another round, Barrsquoel concluded in one of his columns over the past few days.Whatrsquos certainly not in doubt though, is that whats occurred over the past nine days in Algeria and Sudan has firmly knocked on the head the old racist concept that ldquoArabs are not ready for democracy, because they are Arab.ldquoThe notion that Arabs need dictators to rule over them is a convenient myth for bigots and their symbiotic relationships with autocrats who have poor views of their own people, HA Hellyer, senior associate fellow at RUSI and the Atlantic Council was quoted in the UK press as saying over the last few days.ldquoIt has been proven wrong, again and again, and Algeria and Sudan, notwithstanding the vast ersity that exists in those countries, that are Arab but also African and have many identities, shows the shallowness of that myth, argued Hellyer, as events rapidly unfolded in both countries.And so for the time being Algeria and Sudan stand at a political crossroads. Where both countries go from here largely depends on a combination of internal and external elements. Internally the behaviour of the army and security services in both will be crucial. Also too will be the question of leadership within the protest movement. If there is one worrying parallel with the Arab Spring of  in Algeriarsquos protests itrsquos that they lack any obvious leader. The mostly young protesters are a movement with no formal organisation, no recognisable representatives. This was a fatal flaw back in  in that it meant its supporters had nobody to negotiate a transition to a more democratic system or to manage the protestersrsquo expectations.Externally meanwhile the outcome of the protests will also be determined by the response from the international community and in this respect there are clear dferences with the Arab Spring uprisings of .Itrsquos hard to see how this second wave of uprisings will gain the same support as that received by the first wave. Given the traumatic experience of the first wave, particularly in Libya and Syria, many Western policymakers will likely think twice before showing their support for political change in the region.Also since  right wing parties have gained power in several Western countries, most notably in the US, which have prioritised issues of migration and counterterrorism at home over political freedom and human rights abroad.Again looking back, Washingtonrsquos response to the Arab Spring of  was one of the greatest foreign policy failures of President Barack Obama.While his administration encouraged the ouster of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, when subsequent elections produced a government led by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood the Obama administration was lost for a response.Indeed it said next to nothing too when the Egyptian army stepped in and put into the presidency the military chief, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.Obamarsquos successor Donald Trump as we all know by now, has a penchant for so-called ldquostrongmen. On Thursday the State Department hailed the ldquohistoric moment as Sudanrsquos al-Bashir was toppled, but appeared to be taken by surprise with a senior official just days earlier declining to describe the mounting protests as a ldquocrisis.In both Sudan and Algeria, the US has only gently encouraged the two countriesrsquo new military leaders to support democracy, voicing support for ldquothe people.ldquoFor more than two years, the Trump administration has gutted Americarsquos diplomatic tools to respond to the complicated political transitions unfolding in Sudan and Algeria, and his team has made freedom and democracy a much lower priority in Americarsquos foreign policy agenda than any other US Administration in recent memory, warns Brian Katulis, senior fellow at the independent policy institute, the Centre for American Progress.Looking back now to those heady days of  itrsquos easy to be sceptical of the potential for a successful outcome to the protests in Sudan and Algeria. What they have shown though is that citizens in North Africa and the Middle East are sick of tyranny and long to participate in the shaping of their own societies. Those citizens too have also learned lessons from mistakes made back then.During the recent protests in Algeria, ordinary Algerians handed each other bottles of water and snacks, and cleaned the streets after themselves in gestures of civic pride. In Sudan, the protesters elevated women to leadership positions within the crowds and across both protests there was a spirit of non-violence.Itrsquos clear that the aspirations that surged to the surface right across the Middle East and North Africa early in  have not been killed off. The Arab Spring without doubt is definitely being revisited."},{"url":null,"title":"six-changes-that-could-transform-council-finances","story":"Here are six radical suggestions that could transform the fortunes of our local authorities:Scrap council taxUNISON is calling for council tax to be replaced by Land Value Tax , a proposal favoured by economists and deemed to be fairer to those living in low-value homes.It is one of the most important forms of income for councils, and along with business rates, fees and charges, is used to pay for everything from bin collection and roads maintenance to libraries and leisure centres.Experts have long criticised the current system, saying the inaccurate banding structures which use the value of property in  to determine how much householders have to pay are slanted in favour of those in high-value homes. Those living in the lowest-value homeswill pay around a third of what those in the highest valuepay, although band H homes will be worth at least eight times those in band A. The system hasnrsquot been updated or re-evaluated to take into account the changes in house prices since  either, prompting calls for it to be replaced.LVT would see a yearly charge based on the value of the land property sits on ndash reflecting the current value of homes. Businesses would pay an annual tax based on the value of business premises, including the land, instead of business rates.Report authors have called for a switch from the current council tax model to be seriously considered, but admit even getting the suggestions discussed \"has been extraordinarily dficult, with well-researched and argued proposals unable to proceed from the reporting stage to due consideration by political parties and civic society\".They explained: \"The introduction of a Land Value tax is extremely radical and could not be introduced suddenly. In planning its introduction consideration would be needed to be given to those impacted by it. For example, there are some elderly people who do not want to leave their homes, and who find themselves to be asset-rich, but with insufficient income ... A thorough analysis should be carried out and discussed widely before it is introduced.\"Nonetheless ... this is a goal which is worth pursuing.\"Wipe out debtAlthough one of the least likely ideas to be taken on board by Westminster, this idea could have the biggest effect on council finances.Around poundbn a year ndash half of all council tax collected ndash is spent simply on paying interest on loans from banks and for PFI contracts, so clearing the debts could save local authorities billions. The cash saved could then be used investing in local services again.Unisons report explains: \"Trade unions should explore how local authority debts and PFI PPP contracts can be taken over by the Treasury, saving local government many billions in interest charges each year and so releasing tax revenues for investment in local economies and communities.\"Around the millennium there was evidence that investors in the City would have been willing to lend long-term at reasonably low rates of interest. Those days are now well gone, and many local authorities are facing extremely expensive debt burdens, with lsquoLender Option, Borrower Optionrsquobank loans especially problematic.\"While finance institutions may be willing to lend the costs of borrowing from them do not offer a sustainable and reasonable source of funding.\"Increasing tax for second homes, holiday homes and property owned by non-Scottish residentsThe most recent Scottish Government budget includes putting up the amount of tax people pay on second homes and buy-to-lets by %, from  to %. These plans have been welcomed by economists in Unisons report, but authors say that this could go further, with careful analysis on the impact it could have on renters. They suggest: \"Obviously, this rate could be increased further with modelling and analysis needed to ensure that rents are not increased to the detriment of tenants.\"Taxes on property which is owned by people who do not live in Scotland, and therefore do not pay income tax here, should be extended to local authorities, allowing them to collect these fees.The report authors explain: \"Extending the tax base for local authorities to include all heritable property may be worth pursuing, by first checking that this would be legislatively competent ... This is an avenue worth exploring as it would target those who are able to benefit from property ownership in Scotland but not contribute according to their wealth.\"Crack down on tax avoidersMore staff should be brought in to councils, government and agencies to help catch those exploiting loopholes in the system or simply not paying what they should in taxes.According to HMRC, around pound.bn is lost across the UK every year by tax evasion or tax avoidance. Unisons report argues that more staff need to be employed to track down people not paying their share, explaining: \"In the short term, the Scottish Government, Cosla, local government and professional bodies can work together to identy where loopholes, avoidance and coverage has allowed some to escape making their fair contribution to the collection of tax revenues.\"It adds: \"Recruitment of additional staff to ensure that registration, regulation and collection of revenues is undertaken could be achieved cost-effectively so adding to total funds.\"Bring services back under public ownershipLothian Buses are the prime example, according to Unisons report, of how public transport can work for everyonetaken under council ownership. The firm, run by four councils, had a surplus of poundmillion last year and Edinburghs transport has been ranked some of the best in the world. Outside London, bus use across the UK has fallen by more than % since , with fares rising % above inflation, except in areas where local authorities have retained their bus services and run them themselves.In England, councils have been banned from operating their own bus services, and in Scotland a change in legislation would be needed to allow it to happen in local authorities. The report states: \"While it would take a change in legislation in Scotland for local authorities who did not manage to retain ownership to operate buses again, it would appear that this could be a viable source of revenue for local government.\"Furthermore,buses were again operated by local authorities then tax payers would be relieved of the current high levels of subsidy paid to, often overseas state-owned, enterprises who currently run much of our transport infrastructure.\"They also propose introducing a not-for-profit public energy firm, similar to that run by Nottingham City Council which launched in  and has , customers. Last year the scheme had a surplus of pound, which will be reinvested on expansion and bring down costs.Scrap tax relief schemes not fit for purposeDespite no need to change legislation, amending or scrapping the small business bonus schemehas faced \"political challenges\" according to Unisons report. Authors are critical of politicians \"adopting short-term soundbites rather than constructive dialogue\" on how best to fix the problems. The SBBS costs the Scottish Government more than poundmillion a year, but is described as \"deadweight\" cash, with the economic benefits \"exaggerated and unfounded\". Non Domestic Rates have also been described as in need of review, and costs around poundm a year, according to Unisons report.Finally, tax-free schemes for independent schools, charities and sports clubs should be made on a discretionary basis depending on what they contribute to the community around them, according to the report.It explains: \"Some of the particular tax reliefs, for example, independent schools and sports clubs, would be better considered locally where the health and social care partnerships and secondary education are also focused.\""},{"url":null,"title":"herald-on-sunday-letters-what-readers-are-saying-this-week","story":"The abuse that Nicola Gilchrist, the chair of Scottish Womens Aid, has received is disgusting and should be addressed robustly by Police Scotland Rangers domestic abuse TV comment, Herald on Sunday, March .

Yet after the last few years of such uncertainty, surely Scotland deserves some time to allow the dust to settle and to reflect after the  Holyrood elections. If the SNP secure a clear majority based on a manesto centred on the pursuit of independence then they will have strengthened the case to put to the UK government. Alternatively,pro-UK parties have a collective majority then that updated will of the people will avoid the need for a further isive referendum.For the SNP to push ahead now will simply be interpreted by many as primarily an attempt to stir more grievance from the inevitable rejection by a UK government still embroiled in all the implications of Brexit.Keith HowellWest LintonIt looks like Nicola Sturgeonrsquos speech writers are in for a tough time at the forthcoming SNP conference.Of course theyll be able to fudge over - at least well enough for the SNP faithful - Ms Sturgeons failure to address the educational attainment gap, her apparent inability to reduce NHS waiting times and that Scot Rail lets down commuters on a daily basis across Scotland.But where the SNP leaders spin-doctors will struggle is Brexit. Conference after conference, she turns up to tell delegates Brexit equals independence - but she doesnt deliver. Shes been teasing dyed-in-the-wool separatists with another indyref announcement for months.Its not Ms Sturgeons fault Brexit is going slowly but many in the SNP establishment grow impatient, requiring her to demand indyref now - some even favour a Catalan style referendum.But the cautious SNP leader wants to play it by the book and wont risk an unofficial referendum - and the EU has now granted a six month delay to Brexit, with still no one knowing what form Brexit will take.So Downing St will inevitably continue to reject any renewed indyref demands until, very likely, after the next Holyrood election in . Good luck to Ms Sturgeons spin-doctor team trying to get a y standing ovation out of that message.Martin RedfernEdinburghAlexander McKay suggests \"a complete realignment of British politics\" and proposes \"a new three or perhaps four party system where the views of the voters are reflected properly\" .I can only assume that he is referring to the system that has been used by the Scottish Parliament for almost  years, which does properly reflect the views of the voters and incidentally, where the SNP is in its historic third successive term of government.Ruth Marr,StirlingLaw change is the right thing to doThe news last week that a small cross-party group of MSPrsquos remain opposed to attempts to legalise assisted suicide is disappointing. Just how unrepresentative this position is, when compared to that of their constituents, can be shown by the Populus survey, where nine out of  Scots support legalising assisted dying.The groundless claim that it would have ldquoa damaging effect on society in Scotland ignores the experience from other parts of the world, including the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, Belgium and Luxembourg. Their laws permit assistance to be made available,requested, to those in need. What evidence can the MSPs provide that civilisation in these countries has been wounded as a result of such compassionate legislation MSPs at Holyrood must change the law on assisted dying, but not because that would bring us into line with other civilised societies. They should do so because it would be the right thing to do.Dr Bob Scott DrymenA nit Im delighted to pickBeing a man of a certain age, the only pleasure I have left in le is nit-picking.

The fact that it has not been widely adopted should not be allowed to obscure the fact that, where it is the norm, it more than achieves the financial outcomes for which it was designed.LVT implementation in Scotland would be extremely radical but the net effect of a carefully implemented LVT that generates funds of the magnitude required by local councils to restore public services to their pre-austerity levels would be worthwhile.The question as to whether Danson and Whittamrsquos ideas are sufficient to provide much needed funds for local councils remains unanswered, but they do unearth a radical solution.

The fact that Germany exports more than it imports while the UK imports more than it exports might be a factor here.Based on my professional experience in manufacturing I can guarantee that any uptick in the UK economy is purely to down to front-loading of manufacturing for the impending shock of Brexit. The next stage, evenwe do not exit, will be a surprise contraction in manufacturing output as stock levels have soared this is unavoidable now as the process has started. The supply channels and warehouses are full. The more subtle impacts of wasted commercial investment in Brexit mitigation will echo through businesses for a long long time. The lost jobs down to business migration to the EU are gone forever. Thankfully this will probably peter out now.Irsquom not sure where Mr Lakin was in the early s after we soared like an eagle out of the three-day week, miners strike, power strikes, lorry driver strikes and pound devaluation. I can say with great certainty no one was soaring in Clydebank. We had unemployment at levels unseen since before the war. My own father was unemployed for eight years without break. The whole country was affected, whole families devastated.I have always said from the start that once the realities of Brexit were felt that you will be hard pushed to find anyone who will admit supporting this nonsense. That wave has now begun. We can be thankful for cooler heads in Westminster, some very lucky parliamentary arithmetic and to our great friends in the EU for helping us avoid a national catastrophe.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Scrutiny of his leadership in South Bend has increased, as has his criticism of vice president Mike Pence, who was Indianarsquos governor when Mr Buttigieg was in his first term as mayor.Mr Buttigieg would be the first openly gay nominee of a major presidential party he married his husband Chasten last year.-- vw,vw,px, px\"Pete Buttigieg is joined by his husband Chasten Glezman--He would be the first mayor to go directly to the White House.

The UK #Government has, however, closed the FiT scheme to new applications from  April.Subject to some limited exceptions , the closure extends to the FiT subsidies for both generating and exporting electricity. This means there will now be no access to direct subsidies for new small-scale low-carbon electricity generation.The government did encounter some signicant opposition to this move in their consultation on the issue. One particular concern noted in the consultation responses was the lack of routes to market for small-scale generators which would be causedthe FiT scheme were closed. The government’s response in December  promised “specic proposals for future arrangements in due course”.The solution now proposed by the government takes the form of a Smart Export Guarantee .The SEG, set out in a separate consultation which ran from January to March , would see the government legislate for electricity suppliers with more than , customers to remunerate small-scale low-carbon generators for the electricity they export to the grid. Smaller suppliers would be able to opt inthey wished. The suppliers would be obliged to offer small-scale generators at least one export tarf per kWh, but with suppliers able to determine what price to offer and theof the contract.The government’s stated aim would be to keep the route to market open for small-scale generators, whilst also moving towards a “market-based” and “cost-reflective” pricing model. Their longer term aim, as set out in the consultation, is to remove government intervention from small-scale low-carbon electricity generation in its entirety .The end of the FiT scheme marks a stage of that process and a SEG would clearly represent a signicant sht for those looking to invest in small-scale generation. What will have disappointed the industry is the period of uncertainty effectively created by the closure of the FiT scheme without a successor scheme or clear alternative ready to launch. From homeowners and community bodies considering installing solar PV, to farmers and landowners looking at installing wind turbines and anaerobic digesters, would-be participants will be questioningand when to go ahead and the risks to businesses in the sector and of dficulties in financing projects are not insignicant.That said, uncertainty was re throughout the le of the FiT scheme. Through repeated and signicant reviews by successive governments, and in particular some severe tarf cuts, the FiT scheme still succeeded in stimulating small-scale renewable electricity generation. Some would argue that is what a subsidy for an emerging technology is for. With the dfering policies on energy as between the UK and Scottish Governments , particularly in the ongoing context ofBrexit and SNP cogitations on another independence referendum, it seems unlikely we will see an end to uncertainty soon. There will no doubt be a requirement before long to power a new era of electric motoring and Scotland will continue to enjoy a disproportionate share within the UK of natural resources suitable for renewable energy generation – one would assume renewables will necessarily continue to form part of the energy mix north of the border.Alistair Rushworth is a Partner at Turcan Connell.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian monteith the brexit party should not be written off in scotland","story":"The Brexit Party has launched, and all the evidence suggests it shall complete a successful mission to change our political constellation # but will it land with any Scottish MEPs The tendency in Scotland is to write off sympathy for Brexit but, just as I warned in this column five years ago, there is a substantial eurosceptic minority looking for a voice. The last time there were EU elections in  Scotland ed a Ukip MEP with over , votes and . per cent of the vote. On  May, when the European elections that were not meant to take place will be held, the Brexit Party should pick up that seatit offers a rational and inoffensive home for that existing support. Indeed it could do even betterthere is a signicant fall in Conservative or Labour support. In England and Wales the Conservative Party is already on its way to a collapse. Reports from members out on the stump for council elections on  May already make for harrowing reading back at Tory HQ with tales of doors being slammed in canvassers’ faces, donations drying up and members resigning from the party. What had been a trickle of dissent over first, the Prime Minister’s Chequers betrayal and then her surrender by way of the EU’s Withdrawal Agreement, became a torrent of protests when the UK did not leave the EU on  March as promised incessantly by Theresa May.Over a hundredConservative council candidates and Tory association chairmen have written to the press warning of what could become an existential shock to the party’s actual survival. Social media is full of Tweets and posts about supporters never voting Conservative again so long as Theresa May is leader and the party does not honour its commitment to deliver Brexit.The latest UK polling for the European Parliament elections makes shocking reading for Theresa May’s Conservative Party. A YouGov survey shows Labour ahead on  per cent with Conservatives on  per cent and the Brexit Party – even before it had officially launched on  per cent. Ukip is below on  per cent and the Liberal Democrats slipping to  per cent, and the Independent Group formed of Remain defectors from the Labour and Conservativeson  per cent. SNP Plaid Cymru polled  per cent.One opinion survey is, however, only a snapshot further evidence is necessary to identy trends that suggest a credible consistency in support. Unfortunately for the Conservatives a second poll by Opinium provided that the day after with again Labour firstand Conservatives second– with Ukip thirdand the Brexit Party already fourth . The Liberal Democrats came in at  per cent, Greens and SNP both  per cent and Change UK on  per cent.I expect the freshness of the Brexit Party and the pulling power of its charismatic yet Marmite leader Nigel Farage to help it grow, to the cost of Ukip support. Candidates will be important, but the trend is highly likely for the Brexit Party to take over where Ukip has left off.Importantly, note how in both pollsthe support for Ukip and Brexit Party are put together it is larger than that of the Conservatives, totalling  per cent in YouGov and  per cent in Opinium. The Tories are in dire trouble, with still five weeks to go this can only get worse for Theresa May. The Daily , the unofficial organ of Conservative sentiment is railing against May and urging leadership regime change, while two former Chairmen of the backbench  Committee say the rules to depose the leader can easily be altered.Despite all the foregoing, Scotland is dferent. In the UK referendum the majority of Scottish voters chose Remain and the Scottish Conservative Party has reflected this, with its Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, and Scottish Secretary in May’s Cabinet, David Mundell, both devout uber Remainers. Initially, three of the  Scottish Tory MPs sided against the Withdrawal Agreement but that reduced by the time of the third vote. Without an elected figurehead to rally around, and conscious of the need to continue the revival of the party in Scotland any display of recalcitrance in the ranks is also scarce.But wait, there was a City of Edinburgh Council by-election in Leith last week that might suggest all is not well with Conservative voters,not party activists. The Tories talked their chances up, using a hard-working candidate and their good performance in the  council elections to justy the bold claim that only they could beat the SNP. In the end their man came an embarrassing fourth with . per cent of the vote– but more importantly suffered a . per cent drop in support. Could the levee be about to break  It’s hard to be certain, for strong local issues over trams and housing development had recently been in play, causing Labour to lose their last Leith councillor and come third to the SNP winner and Green runner up, both of whom increased their vote share. But the Tories were surprised by their reversal.Beyond scooping-up previous Scottish Ukip votes and disillusioned Conservatives there is a not insubstantial group of SNP voters who voted for Leave in the EU referendum. Ashcroft polling estimated some  per cent of the SNP support back in  got behind Brexit, but currently there is no natural party for eurosceptic nationalists to vote when the UK is meant to be leaving the EU. If the Brexit Party can convince enough of that group to put leaving the EU before their sympathy for leaving the UK – in an election that will become a plebiscite about the EU – then it should not just win one MEP, but could just sneak a second. Some private polling I have seen suggest the SNP could lose  per cent of its vote to the Brexit Party.For the Brexit Party the Scottish political landscape may not look as fertile as it does in England and Wales – where the sense of voter outrage over May’s repeated broken promises is tangible – but it is not barren. With some careful cultivation the Brexit Party should be able to consolidate the eurosceptic support behind it and win a seat. If it can provide an appealing Scottish campaign it could go on to surprise its opponents and give Scottish eurosceptics, be they nationalists or unionists, the voicethey have deserved for the last decade.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm rees mogg s hissy fit as lies come home to roost","story":"Euan McColm writes that the normally insouciant Eurosceptic in chief has let slip that his back#s against the wall.It was as revealing as it was, seemingly, out of character. Conservative Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg does a dependable line in being quaintly courteous during his frequent interventions on the vexing issue of Brexit, so when he lost his temper last week and threw a tantrum over the prospect of further delays to the UK’s departure from the EU, he revealed a side of him we don’t usually see.It was not a pleasant spectacle.If a Brexit delay meant the UK being – thanks to the need for us to participate in May’s European elections – “stuck” in the EU, then it would be incumbent on our representatives in Strasbourg to be “as dficult as possible”. Rees-Mogg suggested such wheezes as a veto on any increase in EU budgets, the obstruction of any moves towards the creation of an EU army and a block on what he described as French president Emmanuel Macron’s “integrationist schemes”. As is the norm with a frustrated hard-Brexiteer, Rees-Mogg lashes out at others when things don’t go his way. The frightfully polite gentleman schtick evaporates and the teeth are bared beneath that stf upper lip.Pro-Brexit politicians and campaigners would, it seems, never dream of asking themselves whether they might bear any personal responsibility for the situation in which the nation now finds itself.They campaigned in the  referendum on the promisesthat the NHS would prosper and the rest of the world would beat down the UK’s door to lavish us with trade deals.They told us that departure from the EU would be straightforward and painless, predicting negotiations carried through on a warm pillow of bonhomie. And they told us the country would unite behind its new “independent status”.Cynically deflecting every legitimate question as part of a Project Fear strategy, Brexiteers double down on their claims. The problem with anyone who dared to suggest that Brexit mightn’t usher in a new era of British prosperity was that they just didn’t believe.Meaningless stuff, of course. A crisis is a crisis no matter what one believes.Rees-Mogg’s fellow travellers on the Hard Brexit right now say that democracy has been betrayed by the failure of the UK to have left the EU on schedule. The current delay – which looks likely to be extended – and the prospect of the UK having then to participate in May’s European elections has pushed some already furiously angry people closer to the edge. Phasers have been set to maximum outrage.“Forgive them father for they know not what they do,” said Mark Francois, the puffed-up little red-faced Tory MP who’s begun appearing on TV every day in order, it would appear, to display the many and ied ways in which he is a buffoon. We were dangerously close to “Jesus would have voted Leave” territory here. But that’s the hysterical crank-right for you.Rees-Mogg, Francois, the whole whining lot of them, are not the victims of others out to get them. They have not fallen foul of a sinister EU plot or been thwarted by a conspiracy against democracy. The truth is that they and all of the other snake oil salesmen who punted a painless Brexit have been caught out by their own lies. It is as simple as that.During the  campaign, these politicians – and other scoundrels like Boris Johnson – steered away from facts and depended on the emotional response of voters. It was all Take Back Control! and promises of endless sunlit uplands.Nobody who campaigned to Remain is responsible for the fact Leavers relied on unicorn-land fantasies of prosperity to make their case.Brexiteers sneered at the suggestion the EU might not give the UK everything it demanded during departure negotiations. We held so many cards, they said, that our European neighbours would do whatever it took to secure a deal.Now that we know for a fact that the EU has negotiated with the best interests of the EU in mind – fancy that –Brexiteers complain that the UK should have been more forceful.In the fevered fantasies of your Mark Francoises, a Brexiteering hard-man should have walked into those negotiations, slammed his fist on the table and told the whole damned lot of ’em how things were going to be.Rees-Mogg and his cronies in the European Research Group tell us a story of a United Kingdom forced to bend the knee by Europe. In their fantasy, a once-proud Britain is dictated to by the EU. Stripped of influence and power, Britannia has been brought to her knees by unrelated mandarins with their spiteful diktats.Yet, the Rees-Mogg strop suggests to me he knows full well the tale of British subjugation is nonsense. If the UK could go ahead and cause the chaos he wishes to see, doesn’t that rather suggest we have a great deal more influence in the European Union than Brexiteers would like us to think As they get angrier, Brexiteers’ language becomes more dangerous. We’ve heard the accusations of betrayal and treachery, we’ve seen the way some MPs have been singled out for protests by mobs who buy into the lie that the chaos of Brexit represents nothing less than contempt for democracy.This is ugly stuff and I fear things may get much worse.If they do, then those who promised a Brexit that appears – as the nation was frequently warned – to be undeliverable will, I am sure, wring their hands and complain about elites and their contempt for voters. But they cannot continue to outrun their culpability for where we now find ourselves – a bitterly ided Britain that’s become an international laughing stock.Leave campaigners lied and swaggered their way through the  referendum and reality has bitten them, hard. They – and they alone – must take responsibility for the chaos engulfing the Brexit process.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2 currency union plan was disastrous says 2014 campaign chief canavan","story":"The head of the  Scottish independence campaign says its currency policy was \"disastrous\" and left it a \"hostage to fortune\" when the UK Government refused to back it.Dennis Canavan has admitted the currency union proposal effectively left Westminster with a \"veto\" over the plan.

The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe .

If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory.

Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners.

Coincidence  Maybe not.

Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere.

Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/001WH0504NCA-cropped.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dancing dentists scoop title","story":"A group of dancing dentists have secured a prestigious prize after their fundraising efforts raised #, for charity.Colleagues from the Bupa Dental Care Banbridge practice came together to waltz, tango, salsa and foxtrot, raising money for their long-standing charity partner, Make-A-Wish, which creates le-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses.In total, the charity event saw  couples hit the dancefloor to compete for success in front of a crowd of more than  people.

It spreads either through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when the patient coughs or sneezes.“It causes high fever and rash that usually passes in about seven to ten days without causing further problems, but it can also be very serious, with some people developing complications, such as infections of the ears, lungsand brain .“Unfortunately, people can die from measles. The video aims to highlight the signs and symptoms and inform that the safest and most effective way to prevent measles is to ensure you are fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.”Due to lower levels of MMR vaccine uptake in children and young people in some countries, measles continues to circulate. Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is at risk. The MMR vaccine has proven to be a safe and effective way to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella.“Thanks to the high proportion of people in Northern Ireland making the positive decision to get the MMR vaccine over the past decades, cases of these three illnesses here have fallen signicantly. However, these diseases have not gone away and some countries are experiencing outbreaks of measles.“The MMR vaccine is available free of charge as part of the routine immunisation schedule. Children should receive one dose of MMR just after their first birthday and a second dose at three years and four months of age. Anyone who is not surethey are fully-vaccinated should check with their GP practice. If you haven’t had your kids vaccinated, contact your GP surgery to make arrangement for them to get the MMR and help to provide them and those around them with the best protection.”The initial symptoms of measles can include: a runny or blocked nose sneezing sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperaturea cough.To view the video see www.pha.site MMRvimeoFor more information on measles, mumps and rubella see www.pha.site mmr.PHA programme to tackle type  diabetes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"pha programme to tackle type 2 diabetes","story":"A new programme to tackle the increasing prevalence of type  diabetes has been launched by the Public Health Agency.

Type  diabetes accounts for  per cent of all cases and is a serious and progressive condition. The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new diabetes prevention programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor. Trudy Brown, regional type  diabetes prevention programme manager at the PHA, said: “Often, by making simple changes to lestyle, losing weight, adopting a healthier diet and increasing physical activity, people can alter a type two diabetes diagnosis or at least postpone it signicantly.”Participant on the Newtownards programme, Margaret McAllister, aged , discovered she was pre-diabetic via a routine blood test. She said: “Being diagnosed as pre-diabetic was a shock but also an important warning call. “I was then given an opportunity to take part in the diabetes prevention programme.

Music and lyrics in the production are by Eurythmics legend Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard, who co-wrote and produced Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill, so I was looking really forward to hearing how they were going to move the story and action along.The production begins with idealistic couple Sam Wheat, played by Irish actor Niall Sheehy, and Rebekah Lowing in the role of Molly Jensen, a banker and an artist, just starting out on le after buying their first apartment together. Their lives are ripped apart after a mugging goes horribly wrong and Sam is shot dead leaving him ‘between’ here and the afterle. It is his need to protect Molly that drives him to not be welcomed by St Peter at the gates but to try find out what happened.The staging of the production is excellent, whether it’s capturing the New York skyline, taking us into the bowels of the city’s subway or to ‘psychic’ Oda Mae Brown’s palmistry studio just off the beaten track where Sam meets his ally – and a way to get answers.With such a tragic story, comic relief thankfully comes in spades with the introduction of Jacqui Dubois’ Oda Mae, a character brought so brilliantly to le when Whoopi Goldberg did the job onscreen. Jacqui and Niall work brilliantly together and her outlandish outfits are a sight to behold as she belts out ‘Are You a Believer’ to the sad souls coming through her door hoping for a connection to a loved one who has passed on. The use of theatrical trickery is extremely clever, especially when conveying the moment Sam is murdered and immediately becomes a ‘ghost’ or when trying to access a door or move pieces of furniture.A special mention must go to Sergio Pasquariello in his role as the couple’s shady friend Carl, who it becomes clear is in way over his head at the bank, and Jules Brown in his role as murderer Willie Lopez. Both bring menace to the stage and the message is that all is not what it seems no matter how much you think you know a person. Lovonne Zeus Richards is excellent in his role as the Subway Ghost who helps Sam realise how to use his death to his advantage in his quest for retribution.The finale is beautully staged as Sam and Molly get to – and have to – say their final goodbyes and we hear a stirring rendition from Niall Sheehy of The Righteous Brothers’ Unchained Melody – and it’s fair to say there was a bit of snuffling and snfling among the audience.Initially thought unstageable, Ghost The Musical really does work and with tickets limited throughout its week run it’s best to get them quick.Ghost The Musical runs at the Grand Opera House until Saturday April .

At the end of the current season, Sport and Leisure Swts will cease to exist and the club will change their name to Belfast Celtic. Sport and Leisure are locked in a relegation battle in the Bluefin Premier Intermediate League – the third tier of the Irish League. Relegation could see them move into the Ballymena and Provincial League, where fellow West Belfast sides St James’ Swts and Donegal Celtic currently play. However, in a surprise move, Belfast Media Group understands that the club is actively pursuing their options for next season which could see them apply for affiliation to the SSE Airtricity League . Sport and Leisure Swts are affiliated to the Irish Football Association and it was believed the new Belfast Celtic entity would simply take their place. Yet, the committee at Glen Road Heights are exploring their options with Belfast Celtic apparently free to join a dferent league.Clubs seeking to switch leagues would usually require permission from both bodies and it would be unlikely that the IFA would grant such a move. However, a club source expressed their view that the club could force a switch under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In any case, they may not need legal assistance as, strictly speaking, a new club under the name of Belfast Celtic will be formed next month when Sport and Leisure Swts ceases to exist. It is understood that the committee have already held preliminary talks with League of Ireland officials who would welcome a new member as long as the switch received the backing of the IFA. SSE Airtricity Premier Division side Derry City started off in the Irish League, winning the title in . Issues surrounding security during The Troubles forced them to play their home games in Coleraine before they dropped out of the Irish League. Following a number of years in junior football, they joined the League of Ireland in . Belfast Celtic would be an interesting addition to the League of Ireland should they go down that route. Following a long and protracted saga, Sport and Leisure had their application to change their name to Belfast Celtic approved by the board of the IFA last December having consulted with the Northern Ireland Football League, the Co Antrim FA and the Belfast Celtic Society.Sport and Leisure have endured a dficult campaign have find themselves at the foot of the table with just five games remaining. They have three games in hand over second from bottom Armagh City and the sides clash at Holm Park on Saturday afternoon. Packie McAllister’s men also face two games with Portstewart in the coming weeks.Sport and Leisure’s struggles this season have been exacerbated following a host of suspensions handed out to key players in the wake of their abandoned tie with Portstewart in January. Padraig Lynch and Stephen McAlorum are among those set toto action for Saturday’s crucial trip to Armagh, but goalkeeper Michael Magill remains suspended. McAllister’s men gave themselves a fighting chance of avoiding relegation after they battled back from three goals down to claim a vital point against Dollingtown last Saturday at Glen Road Heights.An own goal from Gavin Johnston and a double from Dollingstown’s Keith Johnston seemed to gave sealed the points for the visitors and the Swts suffered a further blow when midfielder Pierce Tully was dismissed. However, they mounted a rousing comeback in the final half hour and goals from Liam Carland, Ronan Carroll and substitute Ciaran McKissock levelled the game at -. Dollingstown were also reduced to  men when Richard Thompson was shown a red card in the closing stages.With Armagh suffering a - defeat to Moyola last Saturday, this weekend’s showdown with Sport and Leisure in Holm Park will go a long to deciding which side finishes bottom of the Premier Intermediate League. It just might not decide which league the West Belfast outfit will be playing in next season when they become Belfast Celtic."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local man loses out on internship over brexit","story":"A Lisburn man has spoken of how he has lost out on a prestigious European internship due to the implications of Brexit.-year-old Ruairí Fisher had successfully applied for an internship with the Scout Movement in Brussels, but was later rejected on the basis that he lives in the North of Ireland, which would be outside the EU in the event of Brexit.Despite Irish citizenship and membership of the all-Ireland Scouting Organisation, a spokesperson for the Scouts told Mr Fisher in an email correspondance that the “benchmark” for EU funding is “current residency” not “citizenship”.“Unless you get an Irish residence for the next six months, you would not be eligible,” the spokesperson added.Speaking to Daily Belfast, Mr Fisher said: “I was annoyed and disappointed that through no fault of my own I was rejected from the internship.“It seems that the people in Westminster and Europe don’t understand the terms of the Good Friday Agreement or the implications of Brexit on it. “I’m an Irish citizen, but because I live in a contested space my opportunities are jeopardized. Even though the terms of the Good Friday Agreement allow me to claim Irish citizenship, EU residency seems to be a sticking point for them.”He continued: “I think it raises questions about the wider impact of Brexit on people here.

I was good being over there and playing for Warwickshire,” said McKenna.“At the same time, I wanted to be back home. It was hard watching Sarsfield’s playing when I came back knowing I couldn’t play Championship. It was hard to take. Our aim has to be to try and have a year like we had two years ago.“I think we should have a good shout. The Intermediategrade looks tough this year, but with the squad we have we should be capable of going well again.”On the football front, Sarsfield’s face neighbours Rossa at the Bear Pit tonightwith both teams bidding to build on their opening victories.Sarsfield’s defeated St Pat’s Lisburn by four points in round one in a repeat of the  JFC final while Rossa laid down a serious marker by defeating Aldergrove - to - in their Division Two opener, so McKenna is expecting a tough battle this evening.“This will be the hardest game we have in the ision,” said McKenna.“We have to play as well as we can and just worry about ourselves and don’t think too much about Rossa.“No matter who we play, we would fancy our chances at home so we have to play to the best of our ability and see where it takes us.“We had a good win over St Pat’s in our first game so we have to try and build that from.”Rossa manager Sean Fleming, meanwhile, expressed his satisfaction with their emphatic win over Aldergrove, but stressed that they will have plenty of competition for promotion this season.“ We were very pleased with it because when both teams were in Division One it was always a one-point game between us. It was good to start the season off with a win against a decent team,” said Fleming.“We hoped to make a quick escape from Division Two the last time we were in it and it didn’t happen for seven or eight years.“Just because you’ve dropped down from Division One doesn’t give you a right to think you’ll go straight back up. You’ve a lot of good quality teams in the ision and they want the same thing we do.”Fleming, like McKenna, is anticipating a close contest when Rossa and Sarsfield’s clash this evening.“It wouldn’t matterone of the teams were in Division One and the other were in Division Three, it is going to be a very close game,” added the Rossa boss, who is sweating on the fitness of Michael Armstrong, Richard Gowdy and Thomas Morgan.“This group of lads from both teams have grown up with each other. They would have faced each other at U, U and at minor and they were always very close games.“Sarsfield’s always play a good brand of strong, physical, competitive football.

Talking to the Andersonstown News, she said: “We are here on a study trip to educate ourselves but we have been given the chance to come to and see how a school like this works. It has been very interesting.”“We have seen some subjects here we would love to introduce into our school. Home Economics and Photography, we don’t have. These really specialised subjects would be lovely for us to have. It was also very interesting to hear about the school, the area it’s in and the high performance they achieve.”Stressing the educational value of the trip, Ms Bentvelzen lauded the staff, students and facilities. “The children are really lovely. We’ve been in several classes but we have not been teaching, because we are from a completely dferent school.“We’ve just been observing in class, listening in, and the teacher explains to us what they#re doing. I talked to one of the students in a Home Economics class while she was cooking and she was enjoying herself and she mentioned something interesting. She told me, ‘Ive been away for a while and I’ve realised I can’t miss classes too much because you miss so much.’ It’s lovely to hear that from students.”“Being in this school is very dferent for a lot of us. We have already been to a number of other schools, we’ve got some young colleagues with us and they haven’t seen this before, so it’s an eye opener, how dferent the education system is over here.”Principal Adrian Walsh echoed these sentiments, stating that the staff and pupils were “delighted” to showcase their facilities and school ethos to their visitors.“They came to us through InterEducation, who askedwe were willing to host a party of teachers from Holland as they were trying to improve English as a foreign language in their own setting.“We felt it was a fantastic opportunity for them to come and see what we do.

It was a big bathroom with a hot tub and a sauna.“There was a motion sensor camera in the corner watching everything, in the corners of the bedroom as well.“There wasn’t one room in that house that didn’t have a camera.“We called a meeting at the pool area and discussed what we were going to do because we didn’t know what we were dealing with.“We knew we needed to get out of this house. He would have been watching us and saw us taking photos of his cameras.“We just left as quickly as we could.”A spokesman for Airbnb said that it took immediate action against the homeowner and suspended his account.“We take privacy issues extremely seriously. As soon as we were made aware we removed this host from our  and fully refunded the guests,” a spokesman said.“We have strict standards governing surveillance devices in listings and take reports of any violations very seriously.“There have been more than half a billion guest arrivals on Airbnb to date and issues are incredibly rare.” data-dfpadtargetingThe Conroys holiday apartment.The family had spent just one night in the villa before they found the cameras, and had to organise accommodation for the remaining five nights.However, although Airbnb refunded them the money for the villa, the family said there was no compensation over the incident and they struggled to find accommodation that was of similar standard to the villa.“We went down to my sister’s place and rang Airbnb. The customer service really was appalling, really terrible,” Ms Conroy said.“I rang the police in Greece. They said there was nothing they could dowe stayed in the property they said maybe they could have. They just didn’t want to know.”The family forked out for a hotel which cost signicantly more as it was last-minute.They said that Airbnb should take some responsibility and look into its homeowners.“I looked through the reviews for the property later and saw that families with kids were staying there,” Ms Conroy said.“They were posting good reviews so obviously they didn’t even notice the cameras.”The revelations come a week after a New Zealand family revealed their horror at finding a hidden camera inside their Cork property after renting through Airbnb.Read MoreTourists in Irish Airbnb find hidden camera livestreaming from their room"},{"url":null,"title":"princess anne tours lighthouses on visit to dublin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Now this delay has wrecked our plans,” Mr Coyle said.“We have to sell off all the stuff that we had stockpiled and we have to stockpile again for October, but my worry is that Brexit can happen at any time. “It can happen in June when they review it, so how do I prepare  How do I manage that “The politicians are not helping the likes of me to prepare when they can’t even give us a date. Will October be the actual date, or will it be pushed down the road again ”Mr Coyle said he and other businesses in the Republic were taking no chances when it came to products manufactured in the UK and had filled warehouses with essentials to avoid empty shelves.“The items I have stockpiled are items that we can’t guarantee we will have on the shelvesa no-deal Brexit happens,” Mr Coyle explained. “Anything that is produced in Great Britain is stuff we have stockpiled. “That would be biscuits such as custard creams, which are manufactured in the Great Britain and brought across, and brands like Heinz.“Custard creams are very telling because they are something that only sell very well in the British Isles — Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales. They are only made in Manchester and a few factories in Great Britain. It’s not something where you can ring up France and ask them to send you a few containers of custard creams — they don’t make them anywhere . “You either have them in from your Great Britain factory, or you don’t have them at all.“I would have several pallets of custard creams and Bourbon creams stockpiled already. That would be almost , biscuits. “They all have a sell-by date, which is before October, and now I have to stop buying them from my supplier and sell what I have stockpiled. “That all has implications for the supply chain behind me.“Another thing we have been stockpiling is garlic bread. There is one factory in the North that makes all the garlic bread for the entire island of Ireland. “If there is a hard border and the customs go in and there are controls and lockdown on the border, all of a sudden the  counties are going to have dficulty sourcing fresh garlic bread. They will have to get it from France or find some other way.“Because the garlic bread is fresh, the day we can’t get it is the day we can’t get it. “We have had to compensate by stockpiling frozen garlic bread. We would have several hundred frozen garlic breads stored in our warehouse in Galway.“Now I have to be prepared to stockpile and buy it all in again for October. We don’t know the future and that is very dficult for us.”Mr Coyle hopes the UK will not leave the EU at all, but he feels that the current situation has left everyone “in limbo”.“I can see a lot of wrong things in Europe, but I certainly don’t want to leave it,” he said. “If there is anything that needs fixed, we will fix it from the inside.“With what has happened now, we are all completely in limbo. “You have all these guys getting paid thousands of pounds a week to sort it out, running around in suits trying to sort it out — and they need to sort it out. “I would hate to see the UK leave the EU, butthey are going, well then, go. At least then we would have some sort of clarity and would know what is happening.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor pete joins 2020 democratic","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That’s why, this time, it’s not just about winning an election – it’s about winning an era.”Mr Buttigieg willthis week to Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the nation’s first nominating contests, to campaign as a fully fledged candidate now being taken more seriously.Over the past few months, Mr Buttigieg has appeared frequently on national TV news and talk shows and developed a strong social media following with his message that the country needs “a new generation of leadership”.Mr Buttigieg’s poll numbers have climbed.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pete Buttigieg announces that he will seek the Democratic presidential nomination during a rally in South Bend Some polls put him behind only Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who sought the party’s nomination in , and former vice president Joe Biden, who has not yet said he is running.Mr Buttigieg’s campaign has raised more than seven million dollarsin the first three months of this year, a total eclipsed by Mr Sanders’s leading  million dollarsbut more than senators Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker.“Right now, it’s pretty fun,” Mr Buttigieg said last month while visiting South Carolina , where he was met by larger-than-expected crowds.His challenge is finding a way to sustain the momentum over the long term and avoiding becoming a “flavour of the month” candidate. Scrutiny of his leadership in South Bend has increased, as has his criticism of vice president Mike Pence, who was Indiana’s governor when Mr Buttigieg was in his first term as mayor.Mr Buttigieg would be the first openly gay nominee of a major presidential party he married his husband Chasten last year. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pete Buttigieg is joined by his husband Chasten Glezman He would be the first mayor to go directly to the White House.

Council must now listen to the views of people, clubs and communities wishes for this key site and invest in the redevelopment of Prehen Boathouse. In addition to this Council should carry out an immediate review into current access points along the river and should carry out a feasibility study to improve access onto the river at Culmore Point to better accommodate Lough Foyle Yacht Club and unlock future potential for the river.\"CAPTION: Paul Hughes pictured at Prehen Boathouse."},{"url":null,"title":"parents devastated planned closure derry primary school","story":"Parents yesterday expressed anger and frustration after it emerged that the Education Authority plans to close the only integrated primary school in the city side of Derry.The Education Authorityhas proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August .The school currently has an enrolment of  pupils which is comprised of Protestant and Catholic children from both the city side and waterside.Parents were first informed of the proposals when a letter was sent out asking them to attend a meeting with EA officials last Thursday, April .One mother, Diana McLaughlin, has a son in primary  and a daughter in primary  at the school.  She has been left “devastated” by the news.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, she said: “To be honest, I am not surprised. We are a small school and have been in danger of this for many years.“With everything going on politically at the moment, and money drying up everywhere and Brexit, I’m not surprised they would come after a small school now.“I am absolutely devastated though and won’t know how to tell my childrenthis goes forward. They call it ‘The Little School with a Big Heart’ for a reason.”Some parents have decided to await the outcome before telling their children, but Mrs McLaughlin gave assurances that they won’t allow the school to close without a fight.“I think a lot are waiting to see what happens. I’m fairly certain the parents here will give a good fight...we feel very passionately about it,” she explained.“The relationships the children have with each other and the teachers are so important. Not to mention the solid academics with such a small ratio. My son has gone strength to strength.“I don’t know anywhere  we could have such a lovely educations for our children.”The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell.  Since then however pupil numbers each year have fluctuated between  and .The school has been a part of the local community for over  years.  It attained Integrated status in  and is the only school with Integrated status on the West Bank of the city.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs part of a pre-publication consultation, the Education Authority is currently seeking any objections or comments on the proposed discontinuance of Groarty CIPS from the Board of Governors, parents and staff of Groarty CIPS and Trustees, and other interested parties in the local community.The consultation document makes reference to the other integrated school in the city, Oakgrove Integrated P.S., which operates “near to or over capacity” and therefore couldn’t accommodate pupils from Groarty P.S.It does however highlight other schools closest to Groarty P.S., such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daróige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family P.S., which the EA says have many unfilled places.The EA argues that the school’s enrolment falls “well short” of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school.And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school.Joint campusThe EA has a duty to encourage, facilitate and promote shared education.  And Groarty CIPS has over the past number of years engaged in Shared Education with Gaelscoil na Daróige.Both schools made a joint submission under the Shared Education CampusesProgramme for a shared campus. However, in consideration of the numbers of Groarty CIPS and the proposed campus, the Education Authority did not endorse Groarty CIPS’s submission as it would “not provide for a sustainable education campus.”At the time staff, parents and pupils of the two schools staged a protest march.In justication of its proposed closure of Groarty CIPS, the EA said it believes other schools in the area can cater for the children’s educational needs and home-to-school transport will “mitigate against this impact” and provide for the safe transportation of pupils from the area to their nearest school.Ultimately, any final decision regarding the future of Groarty Integrated P.S. has to be taken by a minister, ordevolved institutions are still not up and running, by the permanent secretary at the Department of Education by January .The closing date for the consultation process is June  and for those who want to have their say, you can visit: www.eani.org.uk prepublication-consultations groarty-ips"},{"url":null,"title":"richard bolitho derry born dam buster commemorated city cemetery","story":"CAPTION: Derry born Richard Bolitho is pictured on the far right.

The service was followed by a reception at the school.St Columbarsquos is one of four schools, along with St Maryrsquos High School, St Patrickrsquos Grammar and De La Salle High in Downpatrick, which will learn later this month whether they will be merged under a proposal from the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools.Fr McGrady reminded the audience of the strong connection of the history of education in Upper Ards before and after St Columbarsquos was established in January ,.He also spoke of the collegersquos namesake, the Donegal monk Columba.ldquoColumba was a le-long scholar and itrsquos fitting St Columbarsquos is named after him, said Fr McGrady.ldquoIf he was with us today I think he would be very proud to be associated with St Columbarsquos College. As was the case with the Department of Education inspectors, he would recognise the very good and very effective education which the school has provided over the last  years.ldquoHe would admire the good relationships between teacher, pupils and parents and the high standards achieved by students of all abilities, particularly the most vulnerable.Fr McGrady acknowledged the contribution of all involved with the college: governors, PTFA, all staff and pupils, echoing former vice-principal Mrs Margaret Caugheyrsquos view that St Columbarsquos was ldquofamily school, whose door was always open to the community, supporting pupils through the joys, sorrows and their chosen paths in le.He said that many of the staff had spent  years working in the college and added: ldquoIrsquom very conscious also of the presence here today of many of the past and present staff members of St Columbarsquos including our own Fr John McManus, a past member of staff, who preached at the golden jubilee mass  years ago.Fr McGrady told the assembled staff: ldquoYou have all contributed to the reputation of the college. Your presence is a tribute to the strong bonds that have been forged through the past  years.ldquoMany past staff members have sadly gone and many more are enjoying retirement but we have a new wave of teachers who are continuing the work ethic that has been the keystone of our success and you are to be congratulated on your commitment and professionalism..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaigners keen for resolution of baby post mortems  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed news that an all-island solution is being considered to address concern over the controversial decision to send babies to England for post-mortem examination.An interim service currently results in babies being sent to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool due to workforce issues.Health chiefs say the arrangement with the specialist Liverpool hospital has been necessary to ensure what it describes as a ldquorobust perinatal and paediatric pathology service continues in Northern Ireland.The Down Community Health Committee has voiced concern about the traumatic impact on families who have to travel with their babies to England for post-mortem, describing the practice as ldquoinhumanersquo.The issue was one of several campaigners were keen to discuss with Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly, but due to diary commitments, he was unable to meet them.But,in a letter to the health grouprsquos chairman, Eamonn McGrady, Mr Pengelly confirmed that the government department was very aware that changes to paediatric and perinatal pathology services ldquomay add to the distress experienced by families at a devastating time in their lives and this is extremely regrettable.His letter continues: ldquoHealth and Social CareNI has been liaising closely with key charities and families who have been affected by bereavement to ensure the arrangements are as sensitive and respectful as possible.Mr Pengelly said that looking at the longer to medium term, health officials from Northern Ireland and the Republic will investigate the feasibility of an all-island approach to the delivery of paediatric pathology services.He explained that following on from engagement the Health and Social Care Board has had with colleagues in the Republic, the issue was recently discussed by chief medical officers and senior officials from health departments on either side of the border.But Mr Pengelly warned it was important to acknowledge that any potential solution was ldquounlikely to be deliverable in the immediate future due to current capacity constraints in the Republic and the time required for new trainees to specialise in this area.His letter adds: ldquoIn the meantime, HSC will work closely with the Royal Colleges and training organisations to encourage and support training in this specialty in the future.ldquoWork is also underway to assess the feasibility of using emerging technologies which could potentially provide parents with many of the answers they need, which could be provided locally. This work will continue over the coming months.Mr McGrady described the option of delivering an all-island solution as ldquological and believes that it would be welcomed.ldquoIt is clear from Mr Pengellyrsquos letter that there isnrsquot the capacity in the South to deliver the all-island service at the moment. Nonetheless, the feasibility of doing so in the future is being examined, he continued.ldquoConfirmation that the use of modern technology to provide answers to parents and avoid a full invasive post mortem is also positive step.Mrs Anne Trainor, who was one of the first people to raise the issue of babies being sent to England for post-mortem, has welcomed Mr Pengellyrsquos letter.The experienced health campaigner, whose daughter Joanne sadly passed away in  aged four-and-a-half as a result of the Tricuspid Atresia heart condition, described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral.She continued: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le. You will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child.While Mrs Trainor believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, she admits she would also be in favour of an all island service.The contents of the Permanent Secretaryrsquos letter are due to be discussed at tonightrsquos meeting of the Down Community Health Committee int Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn, Downpatrick, at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity group celebrates raising huge sum  ","story":"FRIENDS of the Cancer Centrersquos Newcastle fundraising group is delighted to announce it has raised a phenomenal pound, since it began in .

People have moved on and these types of actions are not acceptable and have no support in our community.ldquoThose responsible need to accept that they progress no-onersquos agenda but their own and the wider community will condemn this activity and call for it to cease.Local Sinn Fein councillor John Rice also condemned those responsible for the device.The Slieve Croob representative said: ldquoAs we approach the local government election, the only acceptable way to get your message across to the community is at the ballot box, not like this. This also seriously inconvenienced members of the public with the road closure, particularly schoolchildren trying to get to school.Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis has said he commended ldquothe diligence of the local resident who spotted the device and alerted emergency service.He said that it looked like the device was ldquopositioned to ambush and kill, adding: ldquoPolice should now begin to carry out local searches to establish where and how this device was constructed.

This bacteria increases the rate of lung decline and puts him at a greater risk to other infections.The hopes of Lorcaacutenrsquos parents crumbled when they heard last week that the house purchase, made possible by Jenrsquos parents, had fallen through due to a legal issue.Then just five days later, the couple learnt that the intensive antibiotic treatment that Lorcaacuten had been receiving over the past three months had failed to treat the bacteria.Jen told the Recorder last night that she and her husband ldquowere at their wits end at the current impasse.ldquoThe medical team are going to try two weeks of a dferent nebulised antibiotic with Lorcaacuten and thenit still there, itrsquos two weeks of IV treatment in hospital, she explained. ldquoThey will try alternative antibiotics and treatment for the next six months. It is such bad timing with the house falling through last week.ldquoWe just think he could be on Orkambi right nowwe were across the border.ldquoItrsquos such a hard thing to talk about to people at the moment about that the treatment not working and hard to explain as Lorcaacuten looks so well.ldquoI havenrsquot been out much since the news and when I went to one of Lorcaacutenrsquos wee groups all I could do is cry.An option for the young couple is to possibly consider is making a permanent move to Louth and sell their Downpatrick home.Lorcaacuten was diagnosed with cystic fibroris at  days old. It is a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick mucus, which mainly affects the respiratory and digestive system but also affects multiple organs throughout the body.Orkambi is the only drug of its type available to treat the causes and symptoms of CF for children as young as Lorcaacuten.It costs pound, per year to treat a CF patient and parents claim it can add  years on to a CF patientrsquos le expectancy.It was licensed for - year-olds by the European Medicines Agency in Europe in January , and was again licensed for - year-olds in January.While thousands of parents of CF patients throughout the UK believe that it will treat the underlying cause of CF, not just the symptoms, it has not yet been been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencefor England and Wales.NICE has also failed to reach a purchase agreement with the drugrsquos manufacturer Vertex.The Scottish Medicines Consortium recently introduced Orkambi on a case by case basis for interim access.However, Lorcaacutenrsquos parents are so desperate to get the drug for him that they, along with other CF parents here, have been calling for Stormont to adopt a similiar arrangement.The  year-old mum of two admitted that she had made a desperate call to the Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengellyrsquos office last week and burst into tears talking to his secretary.Mr Pengellyrsquos office sent a letter on April  in reply to the motherrsquos latest enquiry regarding Orkambi for Northern Ireland which stated: lsquoThis is a dficult issue which includes consideration of questions relating to cost and clinical effectiveness and access to commercially confidential information, which adds further complexity. However, I would hope that these discussions will be concluded as soon as practically possible.rsquoThe couple say that they feel that their options are limited, particularly in the absence of a Stormont executive and the ongoing uncertainity regarding Brexit.Jen said: ldquoI blame Brexit as everyone is waiting around to see what happens and I think Stormont would have been up and running againit hadnrsquot been for that.A recent petition to have Orkambi introduced in line with other EC countries has gained more than , signatures to have it debated in parliament.ldquoThe petition getting , signatures last week is the only good news we have had, but the earliest it can happen is June, said Jen.ldquoI would like to thank everyone who as signed the petition as we know that a high percentage of those who did came from Northern Ireland.Jen, in agreement with her husband, has been very vocal in telling Lorcaacutenrsquos story to the media but says itrsquos a position she would rather not have to take.ldquoItrsquos very, very hard to stay positive at the moment and very hard to keep going with Lorcaacutenrsquos treatment when you feel that itrsquos not working. The treatment so far has only kept the levels of the bacteria at a low level, not to clear it up, she said.ldquoI hate having to spill my guts to the media but the reason for sharing his story is to implore the public, politicians and media to support the Orkambi Now campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 10%2C 1979  ","story":"MOURNES mdash A full-scale operation was launched on Monday to bring  frightened schoolchildren down to safety from the blizzard-swept Mourne Mountains.Amid blinding snow and freezing mist, two local rescue teams struggled to reach three parties of children who got into dficulties when preparing for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme.The Mourne Rescue Team, led by Mr Teddy Hawkins, set out to rescue two of the parties and a team from Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuit Centre went out to help the third party.The rescue drama began when three young climbers scrambled down from the Mournes and telephoned Newcastle police with the news that a  year-old girl had collapsed at Millstone Mountain on Donard.When the Mourne team arrived the girl, suffering from exposure, had already been put into a sleeping bag and bivouac by her colleagues. She was put on to a stretcher and whisked to safety to a police Land Rover waiting in a forest track.The other schoolchildren in the party were soon brought down to safety by Mr Hawkinsrsquo team and were given a change of clothing and a cup of tea at Newcastle police station.The second stranded group were rescued from the Commedagh area above Tollymore Forest. Two members of the party managed to make their way to Tollymore Mountain Centre to report that a  year-old girl had collapsed with exposure. She was brought down to a rescue vehicle by the others in her group and they were all taken to safety in a minibus.The Ardnabannon team handled the third rescue operation when children got into trouble at Lukersquos Mountain. A  year-old boy collapsed and a teacher who was with the party carried him on his back to meet the team.After the rescue operation was completed Mr Hawkins warned that a serious accident could occuryoung people continue to camp out in the Mournes during severe weather conditions.DOWNPATRICK mdash A Downpatrick couple had to escape through an upstairs window using a ladder when their house caught fire on Sunday afternoon.Mr and Mrs S McKeown, of Pegasus Walk, made their escape after they discovered their house was on fire at around pm. Local firemen were called to the scene and using breathing apparatus confined the damage to the living room. Damage to this area was extensive.Later in the evening firemen were called to Major Corbettrsquos home at Tyrella and had to remove the fireplace to prevent further damage. On Friday they had to attend a chimney fire at the home of Mr Sean Quinn, Pemberton Park, Downpatrick.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos mansion and -acre Montalto estate at Ballynahinch have been bought by a Belfast partnership for well over pound million within three weeks of the property being put on the market. The partners are two large and long established private companies, James P Corry  Co Ltd, the noted timber merchants and builders suppliers, and John Hogg  Co Ltd, Ulsterrsquos biggest flax merchants. Both firms have extensive involvements in the agricultural industry.Public reaction to the sale is cheerful as Montalto will continue to be run as an agricultural enterprise and will not be stripped of any of its assets.The future of the mansion will be carefully considered by the new owners.

But Ms Godfrey made it clear that this is not a viable option on a long term basis.Her letter adds: ldquoThe current marshalling area cannot operate as a self-policing facility due to restrictions of the road infrastructure within Strangford village.ldquoWe are currently exploring alternative arrangements to facilitate queueing vehicles and have agreed to work with Newry, Mourne and Down Council to bring forward options on this matter for consultation after the local elections.At the start of the year, politicians on both sides of Strangford Lough joined forces to help improve the busy waterwaysrsquos ferry crossing and address local concern.As part of a new initiative, they met with the arearsquos most senior roads official who is responsible for the service with two key issues dominating the agenda mdash an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry and the congestion in Strangford village caused by ferry traffic.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the commitment to investigate both areas of concern, explaining that the congestion in Strangford is particularly acute at times which impacts on residents and businesses.He said locals are keen to see drivers wishing to board the ferry using a dedicated lane which runs alongside the ferry terminal, with additional finance provided to enable staff to ensure the lane is used to combat the congestion problem.Cllr Curran continued: ldquoThere is a need for an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to meet the needs of people heading for work. The first sailing is always busy and many are left frustratedthey are not able to make it.It was reported recently that some workers are forced to leave their car in Strangford all week and travel as foot passengers on the first morning crossing from Portaferry to make sure they get across the waterway and on to their place of work.ldquoThere is a clear need for the earlier sailing and I fully recognise the need to ensure this does not create an unnecessary convenience residents when the ferryrsquos engines are started. The vessels which provide the crossing are both berthed in Strangford overnight, said Cllr Curran.He added: ldquoIt is important moving forward that we meet the needs of commuters, residents and business owners and come up with a solution that is agreeable to all.ldquoCongestion is a major issue given that vehicles can, at times, be queued from the ferry terminal back as far as St Josephrsquos Primary School at the Downpatrick Road which has a signicant impact on village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Loughinisland give RGU the blues with red hot show  ","story":"NEWLY-PROMOTED Loughininland encountered few problems when they opened their campaign in the top flight with a clinically effective win over an out of sorts Downpatrick at Pairc Tomas Ruiseil on Friday night.Downpatrick went into the game without several prominent players, but had they taken all their chances, then this could have been a dferent story altogether.Conor McGrady pointed Downpatrick into a third minute lead with a converted free, but the home side contrived to waste good possession with some wayward shooting.This deficiency allowed Loughinisland to draw level with a free from Stefan Mason in the th minute before the impressive Conor Megoran nudged the visitors ahead, a lead Jody Gormleyrsquos charges failed to relinquish.Stefan Mason had the ball in the Downpatrick net after  minutes when he left his marker for dead, but referee Gavin Corrigan ruled that he over-carried the ball.This didnrsquot stop Loughinisland reinforcing their superiority and two points from the roaming Rory Mason gave the visitors a - to - lead by the th minute.Ruairi Quinn, Downpatrickrsquos most potent attacker on the night, reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play before a flowing move involving Gary Stranney and Stefan Mason ended with Conor Megoran planting the ball in the Downpatrick net, - to - to Loughinisland.Quinn and Stefan Mason exchanged points as did Conor Megoran and Tom Smyth as Loughinisland took a convincing - to - lead into the half-time break mdash Downpatrickrsquos six wides to Loughinislandrsquos two told its own story.John McCarthy fisted Loughinisland into a six point lead at the start of the second half, just seconds after Downpatrick had wasted yet another scoring opportunity.McGrady and Rory Mason swapped points as Loughinisland continued to be the more effective in possession, although both sides gave hard-earned ball away far too easily on occasions.Downpatrick enjoyed a period of dominance in and around the middle of the park, but all they had to show for their endeavours was a solitary point from Quinn with Conor Megoran and Rory Mason picking off their hosts with some clinical finishing to put the visitors into a commanding - to - lead midway through the second half.Four unanswered points from Tom Smyth, Conor McGrady, Quinn and Colin Leckey left just four points in it with less than  minutes remaining, but good game management from Loughinislandsaw them close up shop in the final stages.A Stefan Mason free in the rd minute was followed by a stunning goal from the same player after he raced away, soccer-style, before beating Jonathan Deeny all ends up with an explosive finish to the net.Downpatrick: Jonathan Deeny, Nathan McShane, Damian Branf, Patrick Smyth, Ronan Murphy, Johnny Bell, Conor Doherty, Peter Turley, Conor McCarron, Conor McGrady , Sean Bell, Tom Smyth , Marty Robinson, Ruairi Quinnfor Smyth, Caolan Bentham for Shields.Loughinisland: Chris Turley, Peter Cochrane, Paddy Megoran, Sean Cochrane, Paul Digney, Dan Gordon, Jonny Flynn, Aaron McClements, Dahman OrsquoToole, Rory Mason , John McCarthy , Paddy McKenny, Ryan Stranney, Stefan Mason , Conor Megoran .

There he acquired an extensive knowledge of modern farming practice.He ed to Ireland on the death of his father with a firm conviction that the advent of the railways in the American West and American competitiveness would pose stern challenges to the survival of small farmers in Ireland.To ensure the survival of Irish agriculture he sought to promote cooperative farming, allied to quality agricultural education and scientic innovation. His mantra was ‘Better farming, better business, better living’.Plunkett set up a cooperative store at Doneraile in Co Cork in . Cooperative stores did not prove a great success but cooperative creameries were. He established his first cooperative creamery at Ballyhahill in Co Limerick two years later.On April   Plunkett set up the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society as an umbrella organisation to co-ordinate the activities of the ious cooperative societies throughout the island. He recorded in his diary: ‘The meeting to inaugurate the IAOS [Irish Agricultural Organisation Society] came off and was brilliantly successful. About  present and thoroughly representative of all sides of Irish le. I spoke for    hours amp spoke well. The movement is now started.’Despite opposition, Plunkett made considerable progress. The most intense opposition came from graziers and shopkeepers. Farmers preferred grazingto dairying.In Mallow, Co Cork, a shopkeeper posed the question: ‘Who are the largest subscribers [to the Nationalist parliamentary fund] ’ He thenproceeded to answer his own question: ‘Why the shopkeepers of course, who as you know have always been the backbone of nationality in Ireland.’R A Anderson, Plunkett’s right-hand man, was to address a meeting in Co Limerick on the advantages of cooperation when a local solicitor discovered that the proposed cooperative was to be apolitical and non-denominational.He pompously announced: ‘Rathkeal is a nationalist town – nationalist to the backbone – and every pound of butter made in this creamery must be made on nationalist principles, or it shan’t be made at all.’This bizarre sentiment was loudly cheered and Anderson was prevented from speaking. Nevertheless by  there were  cooperative societies affiliated to the IAOS with a turnover of £,. The following year there were  affiliated societies with a turnover of £ million and by  there were  societies with a turnover of £. million.Monopoly power firm markets itself to public using public cash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"One of Plunkett’s great strengths was his ability to surround himself with able and talented people. Among these were R A Anderson , a petty sessions clerk at Doneraile and sub-agent to Lord Castletown Professor Tom Finlay, a Cavan man, a Jesuit, academic and social reformer George Russell , a writer, poet, painter and mystic from Lurgan and Harold Barbour, grandson of the founder of the linen manufacturing firm of William Barbour of Lisburn and an advocate of cooperatives even before Plunkett.Lisburn boasted one of the largest and most successful cooperatives in Ireland. Barbour became president of the Lisburn Society in .Plunkett enjoyed the enthusiastic support of two of Ulster’s leading Liberal Unionists: Thomas Andrews and Thomas Sinclair. The cooperative movement enjoyed its greatest success in Ulster and Munster. During the parliamentary recess of - Plunkett brought together a group of Parnellite Nationalist and Unionist politicians who produced a report in August  urging the creation of an Irish department of agriculture and industries. Three years later the report bore fruit with establishment of the Department of Agriculture and technical Instruction with Plunkett as its vice-president.An assiduous pamphleteer, Plunkett’s most signicant publication was ‘Ireland in the New Century’in which he identied paralysing defects in the Irish character and was critical of the Roman Catholic Church’s perceived hostility to industrialism.He thought that the Irish excelled in political organisation but were poor at political thinking. By disregarding the advice of friends to soften the book’s tone, he did himself signicant damage.Plunkett was a dynamic and innovative reformer. An ideas man rather than an organiser, he was not politically savvy. Although he was the Liberal Unionist MP for South County Dublin , he was a very apolitical politician who held many of his fellow politicians in low esteem, believing that they should focus on economic development rather than obsessing about Home Rule. As a result he ended up being distrusted by mainstream nationalists .Prior to  when he became the leader of a reunited Nationalist Party, John Redmond, the leader of the Parnellite Nationalists, was favourably disposed to working with Plunkett but a reunited Nationalist Party in which Dillon was perhaps the most influential figure, seriously circumscribed Redmond’s room for manoeuvre.Privately Redmond would have been very happy with the Wyndham Land Act of  but Dillon was resolutely opposed to anything which might blunt the Nationalist demand for Home Rule.Plunkett encountered dficulty with unionist opinion too, being regarded as insufficiently unionist by some of his South Dublin constituents. He would not have endeared himself to many of them through his support of the GAA, the Gaelic League and the campaign for a Roman Catholic university .In the general election of  Plunkett was unseated through the intervention of the historian F E Ball, a more hard-line Unionist candidate, thus costing unionism one of its few winnable seats outside Ulster.Although Plunkett tried to build bridges between Irishmen of dferent classes, creeds and origins, he often felt as welcome as ‘a dog on a tennis court’ for his pains.try catch  TrendingCookstown  organisers issue statement on Guy

The multi-can packs will be replaced by cardboard packs, which are sustainably sourced, recyclable and fully biodegradable.Inidual cans are fully recyclable, including the widget which is contained inside cans of Draught Guinness. Diageo’s bottling and packaging plant in east Belfast will be the first site that will be up and running with the new packs.Lucie Milburn, operations director at Diageo’s NI beer packaging site, said: “Diageo’s facility in east Belfast plays an important role in the bottling and packaging of our beers, which are exported around the world, including to the US, Canada, Korea and Europe. “This latest investment in sustainable packaging is a reflection of the innovation and expertise of our team in Belfast and Diageo’s commitment to invest in the site, which makes a valuable contribution to the Northern Ireland economy.”Retail uncertainty hits Ulster high streets hardest Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID

She added: “I would say to those out there who are thinking what is the point of another European election, I want people to give us their vote to strengthen our hand in the negotiations that will follow this election, to make sure NI is respected and the result of the referendum is also respected.”Mrs Dodds said that while it has been “one of the greatest privileges” of her le to represent NI at the European Parliament, she added: “It has also been a huge responsibility”.She stated that the DUP did not want to see the UK leaving without a deal, adding: “We want to leave in a structured and ordered way. “I often say we are leaving the political institutions of Europe, but we are not leaving Europe. Europe will always continue to be an important trading and security partner.“We should be leaving in a way that allows us to have access to the single market, to work alongside our neighbours, to continue to develop our links with our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland.”But she reiterated the party’s opposition to the current withdrawal agreement and the Irish border backstop, adding: “We believe is bad for NI economically as it will cut us off from our biggest market in GB.”When askedthe constitutional status of NI post-Brexit was the most important consideration for her party, Mrs Dodds replied: “I believe first and foremost as a unionist that the union that really matters to me is the one of GB and NI. But also I believe as a realistic, practical person, someone who has engaged with business right across NI, that access to our main market is absolutely vitally important for the success of NI going forward.“I metMichel Barnier last week and told him we wanted to leave with a deal, but the impediment to a deal is the backstop. He needs to use the timeto deal with the backstop, and deal with the constitutional and economic implications of it, not just for NI but fior the whole of the UK.”Monopoly power firm markets itself to

As part of our strategy to address this, we make smart investments in information communications and outreach.”When asked again how much it had spent on marketing and whether money which the regulator had approved for staff salaries was being used to fund the publicity, the company said that it would “won’t be making any further comment”.When asked how much SONI had spent on marketing, the Utility Regulator said that it had not approved “a specic spend for ‘promotional activity’”.The regulator said that “it is not unreasonable to assume that there should be less need for signicant promotional activities in circumstances where a company is a monopoly service provider like SONI”.However, it said that regulated utilities “may, on occasion, need to undertake consumer engagement and public affairs related work to successfully deliver signicant utility projects”.Last week the News Letter revealed that after the takeover of SONI by Eirgrid, the Northern Ireland electricity grid was altered so that it can be operated from the Dublin control room of the Irish government-owned company.One industry source said that the move made practical sense and was an outworking of the single electricity market on the island of Ireland.But the history of electricity in Northern Ireland – where electricity was in  used as a weapon by loyalists to bring down power-sharing – makes the development politically sensitive.try catch  TrendingCookstown  organisers issue statement on Guy MartinOrange Order confirms July  venues for Stricken Isle of Man TT racer Steve Mercer says it cant

July  celebrationsAlongside Ballymena, the capital stages a Twelfth demonstration every year.Other sizeable parades will take place in Lisnaskea , Pomeroy , Coleraine , Larneand Rathfriland \", says the statement.Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, Edward Stevenson, hailed the enhanced cultural experience offered by the yearly celebrations. “Once again this summer, the signicance of Orange traditions will be underlined by the scale of our parades,” he said.“Surely there is no other event on these islands that can bring such vast numbers of people onto the streets to enjoy our processions, either by taking part or simply to watch them go by.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Surely it should be three strikes and out for this deal now And so on Monday, further indicative votes were held as MPs once again took control of parliamentary business ndash despite attempts by the government to shut down our debate before it started.Supporting the move to hold these further indicative votes on Monday, I said: ldquoI think Parliament made remarkable progress the other day in a few hours, compared with the Government, who have had two years to sort this out.\"It is important that we not only have the opportunity to make further progress tonight, but,necessary, a small amount of time on Wednesday to get to where we need to be, so that Parliament can take control and we can move forward together as a House.And so on Monday evening, there was a hugely signicant result placing a Peoplersquos Vote as the top option for resolving the impasse, with a Customs Union only narrowly missing out as well.I voted the same way as I did last week ndash for a Customs Union for a Peoplersquos Vote, and to revoke Article we face a No Deal Brexit.Itrsquos time for the PM to compromise for the good of the country.We all need to work together to find a solution.We need a credible Brexit option to be put to a public vote in a final say, with the option on the ballot paper to Remain, in order to find a way through this crisis. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office.

That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.
