After travelling through Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia and Italy, he reached Holland where his asylum claim was rejected, and in April last year, The Dutch authorities gave him a ticket to go back to Romania.Terrified he might be forcibly deported, he took a train to Calais. He knew other Iranians were living near the port in charity tents, planning to take boats illegally across the Channel to England.It was there, last autumn, he met Hadi, a former Tehran taxi-driver who had also fallen foul of the strictly religious Iranian regime for having a relationship with a married woman.The scandal blew up (the woman\u0027s husband had found out about the affair and reported him to the regime) just days after flying into Paris for a tour of Europe. His family immediately \u0027disowned\u0027 him for this \u0027cardinal sin\u0027 and, by now on the authorities\u0027 \u0027black list\u0027, he applied for asylum in Germany.But his claim was rejected and he, too, ended up at the Calais shanty camp, from where he claimed asylum in France.Hadi tells me that conditions in the camp were horrific. He claims four Sudanese people-traffickers attacked an Algerian friend in the neck and chest with carpet cutters. The man nearly died, but recovered in hospital.It was at this point that he and Masoud plotted their escape.A few days later, on August 8, they walked to the Decathlon sports store in Calais. They had a little over €400 (£360) between them, saved by Hadi from an allowance given each week to him as an asylum-seeker by the French government.         Graphic shows the men\u0027s journeys. Both are claiming asylum and hope to stay in BritainExplains Masoud: \u0027We had to choose the cheapest two-seat polyester kayak and bendy plastic paddles. We bought the most basic pump to blow up the kayak.\u0027The boat cost €250 (£220) and we only had money left for one life-jacket, for Hadi who does not swim. The label said it was for a young teenager.\u0027It took them more than an hour to carry the equipment to the beach and they hid in the dunes, waiting to prepare their crossing.Masoud says they checked the Channel weather, including wind speed, on the internet before setting out. It showed a low wind and no storm brewing. They did not check the tides.Masoud explained that French police use drones to hunt down would-be migrants, adding that there were officers hiding in the sand dunes with torches.When they felt safe, they quickly pumped up the kayak — which had a warning label saying it was suitable only for the beach and inland waters.They jettisoned their shoes to reduce the weight but even then the craft was eight stone over the recommended safety limit. Undeterred by the dangers ahead, they discarded their mobile phones to avoid GPS tracking by the French and British authorities.As the police continued to patrol nearby, the two Iranians threw stones several yards along the sand dunes as a ersionary tactic to make officers believe migrants were hiding there.This allowed them to sprint 700 metres into the sea without being seen. However, non-swimmer Hadi fell in and swallowed water.Masoud recalled: \u0027I had to save his life, pulling him into the kayak. I had to teach him how to paddle, too. It\u0027s a good thing he was a quick learner.\u0027They had only the compass on Masoud\u0027s Casio G-shock watch, a present from his sister, to guide them. \u0027We also followed the lights of the big ferries sailing from Calais to England.\u0027He says they had to paddle fast for at least half an hour to get out of inshore waters away from French police patrols looking for migrant boats.\u0027At one point, we got six metres from a ferry, which turned off its engines to stop us being sucked in by the propellers.\u0027This is thought to be common practice by ferry captains who see a constant stream of migrant boats leaving Calais and cannot halt their journey to rescue every one.Astonishingly, he claims they were spotted by a French police launch which then backed off once it saw the danger of the ferry propellers to its own boat. Masoud and Hadi believe this is why it suddenly returned to shore.After this scare, all went well and the Channel was calm.But then, Hadi, a former amateur boxer, began vomiting the sea-water that he\u0027d swallowed on the beach.\u0027I was paddling alone,\u0027 says Masoud. \u0027Hadi was almost unconscious. I pulled his head back on my knees, distributing his weight evenly. He was breathing shallowly. For two hours he was silent.\u0027Then a huge storm started.Amid 7ft high waves, the 11-ft kayak was tossed like a piece of flotsam.Masoud struggled to stop it overturning. \u0027If a wave had hit us sideways, we would have left this life.\u0027On they went, relentlessly, through the night.Hadi recovered to share the paddling. The kayak was fast shipping water, which they scooped out with their bare hands. By now, it was 5.30am and nearing daylight, six long hours after leaving the French beach, the storm subsided.They paddled on for two more hours and then finally spotted Dover\u0027s town lights.Masoud said: \u0027We had five miles to go and I was sure we were going to make it. We were excited. Then we heard a helicopter from the British Coastguard. It was the most beautiful noise. It hovered over us for an hour, watching us paddling, then went away, before coming back.\u0027Within minutes, a British Border Force cutter, alerted by the helicopter crew, was at their side.After their epic journey, they were safe.The Mail cannot verify every detail of what the men have told about their life in Iran, the reasons they entered Europe or for fleeing Calais to Britain.However, in Masoud\u0027s case we have photos of him competing for Iran in kayaking and other water-sporting competitions, and a dated photo of him in the controversial USA T-shirt with his team-mates in Indonesia.As for Hadi, we have seen Home Office letters to him which confirm that he arrived in Europe on a holiday visa allowing him to travel throughout the EU, and last year claimed asylum in Germany and France.I first heard of the two kayakers from an Iranian living in Germany whom I have known for nearly two years. He mentioned that two friends had recently paddled on a kayak to the UK from France and offered to put me in touch with them.I checked with Border Force reports which confirmed that two Iranian kayakers had, indeed, been found in the sea near Dover the previous Friday. They were among at least 40 migrants who had sailed to Britain overnight, the others in small boats unconnected to the kayakers.Tragically, an Iranian woman fell from a boat and was drowned.Such are the huge risks that migrants are taking to cross on tiny boats to Britain that the MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke this week warned: \u0027It\u0027s rapidly heading to a summer of chaos.\u0027On Thursday, more than 60 migrants were rescued on small boats off the coast of Kent and Sussex after they had sailed from the French coast.Sussex Police said it was \u0027very concerned\u0027 for another group, which it described as \u0027possibly a family including children\u0027, who may have escaped from the beach to avoid the British authorities.More than 1,000 boat migrants have reached Britain from France since last October.Yesterday by midday, another eleven had arrived at Dover on a small boat.All this makes a mockery of the Government\u0027s pledge to halt the flow of illegal boat arrivals.No wonder Home Secretary Priti Patel is to hold urgent talks with her French counterpart and her officials have said the criminal people-trafficking gangs who perpetuate this \u0027are ruthless and do not care about loss of life\u0027.Yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned illegal boat migrants that they face being returned.So as the two Iranian kayakers now recover at their hostel, what are their plans?Both are claiming asylum and hope to stay in Britain.Masoud nonetheless dreams of eventually being able to return to \u0027beautiful\u0027 Iran and his career in water-sports.For his part, Hadi wants to make his life in the UK and \u0027contribute to society\u0027.Whether they get their wishes is now up to the Home Office.But whatever the men\u0027s future, their remarkable tale leaves no doubt about the astonishing lengths that migrants continue to go in order to come to Britain."},{"url":null,"title":"Vanity Fairs Graydon Carter severed cat head outside home amid Jeffrey Epstein reporting","story":"Share this article Nor what that the first time Epstein has tried to intimidate reporters.

He studied at Maidstone College of Art and later attended the Glasgow School of Art. Starling represented Scotland at the Venice Biennale in 2003. His sixth solo exhibition, A-A’, B-B’, takes place between the Modern Institute in Glasgow (7 Sept-26 Oct) and the Galleria Franco Noero in Turin (15 Oct-11 Jan). Starling lives and works in Copenhagen.A-A’, B-B’ is a work of isions and connections across time and space. What was the spark for it?Coming across a fragment of a Tiepolo painting, Halbardier in a Landscape, in the Agnelli collection in Turin about 10 years ago. Much more recently I learned how, in the early 19th century, it was cut from a larger painting called The Finding of Moses, which is now in the Scottish National Gallery. I have occasionally made shows where I try to connect to two venues in a single exhibition, and I guess, because of what’s happening in Britain with Brexit, it seemed like an irresistible moment to make an exhibition about a ided painting.Was it difficult to find a car to cut in two?It was quite hard to find one in the right colour blue. But eventually we found a car in fantastic condition in Rome. I’m kind of lucky with these things I have a feeling that when you go looking for something, you generally find it. The car was cut in half on the biggest band saw I’ve ever seen. It took nine hours. It was extraordinary.You have a long-running interest in the deconstruction and transformation of objects. What’s at the root of that?It’s partly developed out of a curiosity for how things work, which goes back to my childhood. I had a father who didn’t like to pay anybody to do something if he thought he could do himself. I was always surrounded by tools, and a DIY culture, which was completely liberating for me, to be able to go into his little workshop and build something or try to make something fly. That mentality has always been part of the way I think as an artist.Do your ideas tend to come incrementally or all at once?Increasingly, I think they come incrementally. When I was 20, I used to dream artworks: they popped into my head fully formed in those half awake, half-asleep moments. But nowadays it’s much harder. Partly it’s because you become a little bit more demanding of yourself and your ideas, so a lot of the projects evolve over years rather than months. But also – and it always sounds a little bit nutty when I talk about it – I have this idea that the work has a life of its own and that it’s only partly in my control. Very often it’s chance occurrences that trigger things – your gallerist in Italy taking you to see a particular painting, which 10 years later becomes a work.Have you ever had to abandon a piece midway through because it becomes too difficult to execute?What happens is that things morph into something else, rather than me abandoning them. One nice example was a project I made called Island for Weeds, which ended up being shown in the Scottish pavilion at the Venice Biennale. It was originally supposed to be a floating island to support a little colony of rhododendrons on Loch Lomond, in the new national park. The proposal was accepted, but as we were going into production, one of the supporters of the project, Scottish National Heritage, suddenly got cold feet – they were worried my project supporting this invasive species was going to backfire on them – and pulled the plug. But in Venice, this homeless island in a pavilion overlooking the Grand Canal, with unwanted rhododendrons blooming on the top, had a beautiful new drama to it.Do have any interest in the digital world? I can’t find you on social media, for example.No, I’ve stayed away from that to a large degree. I feel like my days are so full of other things that the idea of finding the time to look at Instagram feels exhausting to me. I’ve been working with early computer technologies – Jacquard weaving and the punch card and Babbage. For me, that’s where digital technology is interesting – at its beginnings, when you can put your hands on it and kind of understand it, as opposed to now, when I have no idea what goes on in my mobile phone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/683cfd10821c89616f90c56ea0e7f90cfb8b6d1b/0_0_3500_2279/master/3500.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7a0321221ed90d160a31af73976e8023 2020w","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Amazon wildfires, protests in Hong Kong, Fridays for Future demonstrations, bombardments in Syria and the Palio di Siena – the last seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91df66f0b058c1f02e088dfc65d3bc9db1026a10/0_971_3603_2161/master/3603.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31eb0b747ee1fce1db1e4414f8a5eb8d","title":"amistead maupin interview how do i relax grass","story":"The author on being in drag, coming out and Donald TrumpBorn in Washington, Armistead Maupin, 75, began a column called Tales Of The City in the San Francisco Chronicle in the 1970s it went on to become a series of nine books that are currently being adapted by Netflix.

In her long awaited follow-up, she tackles the history of the American westHow do you disrupt the mythology of the American west, with its campfires and cowboys, and its spirit of masculine self-reliance? If you’re Téa Obreht, you add creatures – and people – who belong to the history but not to the myth. You add, say, camels. Inland, the long-awaited follow-up to her 2011 Orange prize-winning debut The Tiger’s Wife, takes place in the late 19th century across Arizona and its neighbouring territories. It braids together the stories of Nora, an anxious homesteader struggling to hold her family together, and Lurie, a drifter who ends up attaching himself to a real-life convoy of camels imported from the Middle East to test their suitability for military service. Obreht stumbled across the surreal story of the camels by chance, listening to the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class. She describes the episode with palpable delight: “It’s about two women who are beset on their homestead by a creature that they can’t identify and which they claim has supernatural powers. They call it a demon horse.” The apparition turns out to be an escaped camel, with a macabre twist that is best saved for the novel. She found the story “wild, and so grotesque and wonderful!” – and her obsession was fired.The Tiger’s Wife, a novel about the relationship between a young doctor and her grandfather, and about the stories on which both family lore and national identity are built, brought Obreht the kind of success that can be paralysing for a young writer: a New York Times bestseller, finalist for the National Book award, a place on the New Yorker’s 20 best writers under 40 list. But it all happened when she was in her mid-20s – too young and green, she says now, to feel daunted. Since then, she’s been teaching fiction at Hunter College in New York, publishing short stories, and not publishing drafts of two full novels. “All kinds of things interested me, but none of them drew me in enough,” she says. “I was writing more as a way to flex those muscles, but I could feel that my focus on the page and the way I was approaching writing was starting to change. And it frightened me.”It wasn’t until the camels showed up that she found a way to push forward. “Animals have this unnerving tendency to creep into my work, even when I’m trying to hold them at bay,” she says. Animals come up in conversation too, when she describes her efforts to find a new project as placing “little book turtles down on the racetrack”. If not a writer, she would have become a zoologist or biologist. “On a psychological level, I’m deeply interested in three things,” she says, checking them off on her fingers. “Who people are when they’re alone and no one’s watching who people are when they’re telling themselves the most palatable stories of their lives and then who people are with animals.”All three of those interests are richly present in Inland, which draws on Obreht’s longstanding curiosity about the American west. She has spent time travelling through Arizona and Texas, and owns a holiday home in Wyoming, a vast distance physically and culturally from her Manhattan home and the Upper West Side cafe where we’re discussing the book. Like many visitors, she was “floored” by the desert landscape, but felt a pull stronger than simple tourist curiosity. Despite having no roots or connections there, “it felt like a homecoming.”Born Téa Bajraktarević in Belgrade in 1985, Obreht moved to Cyprus and then Cairo as a young child, with her mother and her grandparents (her father was never part of the picture). When she was 12, her grandparents returned to Belgrade and she and her mother emigrated to the US. Her close relationship with her grandfather underpins The Tiger’s Wife, and when he died in 2006, she adopted and began writing under his last name.It was through her grandparents’ love of classic Hollywood westerns that Obreht first imbibed the cowboy vision of the American west. As she researched the history, however, she discovered it was “a lot more erse than anything that is handed down by history or by lore”. As an immigrant, she was particularly keen to uncover the mixing of cultures that went into shaping that quintessentially American landscape, and to put her own spin on the genre’s tropes. The relationship between Lurie and Burke, the camel he adopts, draws on the essential bond between a man and his horse. “It’s for transportation, it’s for shelter, it’s your currency if you need it,” she explains. But the camel also gives Lurie a sense of purpose and identity, enabling him to embrace his Ottoman roots. “His home is the camel.”Obreht’s sprawling cast of characters are all carefully named, allowing her to tell stories in miniature about identity and origins. Spanish names, historical and fictional, are a reminder that many Mexicans in the southwest were not immigrants, but were made foreign as the border migrated around them. (Modern-day Arizona was part of Mexico for the first half of the 19th century, and did not become a US state until 1912.) Lurie, whose name comes from a garbling of Djurić, later befriends a man based on a mysterious real figure named Hadji Ali, a convert to Islam of Greek and Syrian origin, who travelled with the camel corps and became known as Hi Jolly. His story allowed Obreht to explore the ironies of the era’s shifting global power dynamics, in which a man who had “lived under the heel of the Ottoman empire” finds himself, quite by accident, serving “as part of the fist that holds the hammer of a new empire”.Although their presence is constant in the book, Native Americans stand somewhat outside its central perspective. Obreht is thoughtful as she considers why she made this choice. “I’m glad to be writing at a time when more and more voices are able to tell their own stories, and I did not feel that it was my place to encroach on that,” she explains. “My interest was to examine the immigrant perspective, but to try to be as honest as possible about what that meant, with respect to incursion and the overrunning of Native American lands.” It’s also a practical question of surviving sources, of what stories were written down and preserved, and by whom.To research the history of the camels’ presence in the west, Obreht relied heavily on the diary of Edward Fitzgerald Beale, who headed up the camel expedition. Because his was a military record and gave the coordinates of every camp, she was able to revisit all the spots that are accessible by car, which today include “an ultramodernist church” and the Albuquerque Greyhound station. Beale’s assistant, with no interest in proving the value of these curious beasts, barely takes notice of the camels. “He mentions them once, like: ‘All today, the camels were a pain in the ass as usual.’ That’s it.”Obreht also immersed herself in the newspapers of the time, as a resource for shaping the novel’s language. She stayed away from contemporary fiction about the west by writers such as Cormac McCarthy in case she was influenced by them, especially by descriptions of the landscape. The beauty of the desert, after all, is rooted in its inhospitableness and for Nora, tormented by thirst as she moves across it, stunning vistas are hardly at the forefront of her mind. “Maybe the binary in the novel is: is this beautiful, or is this a pain in the ass?” Obreht says with a laugh.It’s a disruptive choice to make a woman a central character in a western story, neither a silent wife nor one of the “balcony women” whose business relies on the constant flow of lonely strangers through town. “One of the tropes of the western that really grabbed me was the woman in the corner, just scowling and literally stirring the pot,” Obreht says. In contrast to the men for whom home is wherever there’s a stream of water or a campfire, Nora is fiercely focused on protecting her domestic realm, “this one little patch of life that she is capable of defending”.In the diaries and letters of homesteading women, Obreht was struck by the “ripples of terror or rage” rising up out of these otherwise fatalistic, even contented accounts of lives haunted by uncertainty and death. Nora’s rage is partly directed at Josie, a young relative of her husband’s from the east, who brings with her a brand of feminine helplessness that seduces Nora’s sons and that Nora herself has worked hard to slough off. Yet there is something universal in her rage, too. Obreht describes how her grandmother, at the end of her life, likewise began to express “things that she, I guess, had been enraged about her whole life but hadn’t given voice to”. Despite feeling that she had lived a good life, “here they were, finally coming to the surface”.Nora’s story plays out in 1893, a period of profound transition in the west – in many ways, the end of the old west as a remote and mythologised place. “It was after the laying of the Transcontinental Railroad and the massacre at Wounded Knee, which represented, in this nationalistic sense, the end of the Native American resistance,” Obreht says. The railroad is fundamental to the geography of the novel: its title, Inland, she explains, is how people referred to land away from the train tracks – it has nothing to do with the coastline, but marks the distance between places that develop and those that wither in isolation.The newspaper, too, is an essential source of connection and power. “Back then, your newspaper was everything.” The paper run by Nora’s husband supplies information and gossip, but also has the power to shape politics and history, to privilege certain stories over others. Cattle barons, she explains, bought up newspapers in the effort to assert a moral right to the power they’d grabbed. They spread the myth that their rise was linked to their inherent virtue and strength. “It’s bootstrap narrative at its absolute core, its beginnings.”The telephone has the power to collapse even bigger distances. In one striking scene, Nora and her fellow townsfolk gather to witness the first exchange of words by phone, an almost magical event that makes her wonder if the gulf between the living and the dead might eventually be bridged by some as-yet-uninvented technology. Nora talks to her daughter, who died as a baby, while Lurie finds himself taken over by the “wanting” of people he’s lost. Yet there’s nothing fantastical about the way these relationships are portrayed. They are simply part of the reality of living in a place where people can disappear for weeks on end, where you don’t know whether they’re living or dead. And it’s a consequence, for Obreht, of the fundamental violence of the west. “It feels haunted to be there, and so much of that is owed to this horrific history on which the shaping of this country really sits.”A novelist can’t predict the world into which her novel is launched, but it’s impossible to discuss questions of borders and history without bringing up the current climate of anti-immigrant rhetoric and violence. Obreht can’t help but be struck by the similarities between the world of her book and today. “I thought I was writing a book set in the west in the 1890s and I didn’t realise how much of it was going to align with this particular cycle that we’ve fallen into now,” she says. “What it showed me was that cultural discourse in this country, as in many others, operates in cyclical ways. We go forward a little bit and then we fall back. We make some progress but also revert in these horrific ways to things we’ve been fighting against for hundreds of years.”Obreht sees it as part of a repeating cycle of anxiety about who belongs, who is truly American – and as evidence of the power of story. When Nora, unable to communicate with her Apache neighbours, convinces herself that they wish her harm, the result is disaster.• Inland by Téa Obreht is published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson (£14.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

What could be a more effective heartstring-tugger than “other European princes have it better than me”? It’s right up there with Chandler’s line from Friends: “My wallet’s too small for my 50s, and my diamond shoes are too tight!”The scene is recalled in an email revealed by Brockman’s soon-to-be former client, the tech author Evgeny Morozov. He is one of many esting themselves of even tenuous Epstein association in the wake of the billionaire financier’s suicide in a Manhattan jail earlier this month, as he awaited trial for sex trafficking, underage and otherwise.But what of Andy? Under some scrutiny, he and ex-wife Duchess Fergie private-jetted away from Balmoral last week, then on to the luxury bit of Sotogrande, where they are said to be gracing private barbecues. Briefings suggest, distractingly, that they might be getting back together. Andrew has been snapped on an exclusive golf course. His daughter Princess Beatrice might be getting engaged to her boyfriend. “They’re going to get married,” royal expert Ingrid Seward declared this week, ertingly. “I was told by a member of the family.” So, on go the Yorks. It really is the full fairytale. By which I mean: fairly Grimm.Back to the foot massage scene, then, where the chaps seem to have got on to Prince Albert’s night-time freedom via the subject of Julian Assange. Brockman reports Andy saying: “We think they’re liberal in Sweden, but it’s more like northern England as opposed to southern Europe.” Is the implication that Swedish authorities investigating sexual assault allegations are being illiberal?Either way, you don’t get all that nanny state stuff on Epstein’s private Virgin Islands property, reportedly known locally as “Paedophile Island”. Or as Buckingham Palace finally put it in a statement denying any impropriety on behalf of the prince: “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes.”I’m slightly sorry for the royal flunkies who had to issue this line, given that most of us are suffering eyeball strain from all the rolling we’re doing. Even so, I do feel we need further clarification on what precisely the Duke is appalled by. Is it just the “recent reports”? Because if we’re meant to believe that Prince Andrew is appalled by ALL of the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein – both the ones alleged and the ones he served actual jail time for – then allow me to treat this statement with all the dignity it deserves. To wit: BULL. SHIT. Bullshit Prince Andrew didn’t know what sort of guy his friend was when he was snapped walking with the Tier 1 sex offender, after he got out of jail, in a photo the New York Post headlined “PRINCE \u0026amp PERV”. Bullshit he didn’t know why his close friend WENT TO PRISON FOR A YEAR, but kept hanging out with him anyway. Bullshit if, as Brockman recounts, he lay on his back in that guy’s house, with a Russian attending to his feet, talking over her head to men of the world about the nocturnal licence afforded to minor European royals, and he didn’t know roughly what he was swimming in. Bullshit. I get we have to pay for Andrew’s lifetime of jollies but we don’t have to have our intelligence insulted by him.I’m not even going to wheel out that old writing device where one says that either Prince Andrew is stupid or deeply compromised, and wonder archly which it is. Guys, he can be both! In fact, the one feeds the other.The plain fact is that Andrew continued to be friends with Epstein even after he pleaded guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution. I guess it was the old she-said, he-said thing. Or as the then-Palm Beach police chief put it: “This was 50-something ‘shes’ and one ‘he’ – and the shes all basically told the same story.” Obviously, Epstein got away lightly with his grotesque plea deal, because 50-something:1 isn’t the ratio you need. Even last year, they still needed 60 accusers to stop Bill Cosby. Donald Trump’s 17:1 she-he ratio is nowhere near enough to keep him from the highest office on the planet.As for where we go from here, perhaps a multimillion-pound royal wedding would indeed be helpful. It should be quite the opposite. Where Princess Anne pointedly didn’t, Prince Andrew demanded all the titles and trappings for his two daughters – security details, civil list money, full royal weddings – and was furious when denied some of them. Yet Beatrice and Eugenie still live like … well, princesses.So instead of distracting from the miserable stories of the female attendees of various Epstein mansions, these gilded lives should throw them into even more shameful relief. They suggest the kind of man, and we’ve all met them, who has a two-tier view of the female sex. There is a world for their daughters, hopefully insulated from men like their friend Jeffrey – and then there is another world for girls who service their friend Jeffrey.Yet decent, humane people know there aren’t two kinds of women and girls – there are just women and girls. I’m reminded of the climactic line in All My Sons, where the wartime profiteer Joe Keller has been finally made – by his own son’s suicide note – to see how his actions were responsible for the fate of so many other young men. “I think to him they were all my sons,” Keller reflects. “And I guess they were. I guess they were.”And so with the girls in the stories that swirl around Epstein and his circle, which includes the Duke: either broken, or yet-to-be-broken. But ultimately, breakable. They are all daughters, too, your Royal Highness. The Russian masseuse on your feet, the 17-year-old runaway on whose bare hip you have your hand in that fateful picture in London, the terrified 14-year-old who ran screaming from your great friend’s house in her underwear, who you must have read about at the time, because I did, and I didn’t even know the guy. And all the others. They are each someone’s daughter, or they were once. They all once played at princesses and castles and imagined their own fairytale weddings. Funny how dreams die, isn’t it – and who helps to crush them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/018d1e8774232e8a8cf378bb81be186685d956f3/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b31ab736257085770eb382d431ad71f0","title":"river cam cambridge river punts environment extraction chalk stream","story":"It’s a beautiful day on the river Cam in Cambridge. As the sun sparkles on the water at Jesus Green lock, tourists line up for ice-cream and prepare to take a punt around the university’s most celebrated colleges. Few notice how pathetic the flow of water is over the lock.It is a clear sign that this ancient waterway is faring badly, says Stephen Tomkins, emeritus fellow and former head of the science faculty at Homerton College. “That little bit running through here is the total flow from the whole of south Cambridgeshire,” he says, pointing at an unimpressive trickle. There just is not enough water, he adds: “The river Cam is drying up.”Tomkins chairs the Cam Valley Forum environmental group, which earlier this month sounded the alarm about the Cam with a manifesto that warns that the river can no longer function properly.“It is just not just ‘the weather’,” the manifesto states. “Over-abstraction of water from the ground is the main reason. We pump too much water out of the chalk for our domestic supplies and, to a smaller extent, for agriculture.”“They have to put water back into the headwaters of the streams in the summer to keep those streams running, because they have taken so much water out of the chalk,” he says.This manoeuvre hides how low the water table has sunk, says Ruth Hawksley, a Wildlife Trust officer in Cambridgeshire. “If they didn’t pump water in, those streams would be dry already. They are very special, fragile habitats which are quite unique to England, and they’re currently at the mercy of a pump and possibly a power cut.”She worries that this precious water supply for the river Cam will eventually be lost. “That’s what Cambridge is drinking. At some point, the river is going to pay the price.”At risk are aquatic plants and invertebrates such as mayflies, caddisflies, damselflies and stoneflies, which provide food for fish such as trout, which in turn are eaten by otters.“We’re losing a lot of the plants, invertebrates and fish we should have on the Cam. It is not the healthy river it should be,” she says.But in the historic centre of Cambridge, the river is canalised, with tightly controlled locks, dams and weirs – so there, despite the depletion of the chalk streams that feed the river out in the countryside, the water levels can appear to be normal. The only clue to the problem is that the water is not clear and its quality is poorer than it should be. “It’s a big pond, basically,” Tomkins says.A short walk from Jesus lock, opposite Magdalene College, Cambridge Punt Company guide Theo Land is preparing to take his next group of tourists punting along the river. “There’s nowhere I’d rather be now it’s summertime in Cambridge,” he says. “There’s nowhere else like this in the world. It’s special.”The heart of Cambridge is the river, he says, and the revelation that it is drying up upsets him. “I wouldn’t feel the same attachment to Cambridge without the river. It would be a different place.”Feargal Sharkey, former frontman of the Undertones, has campaigned to raise the profile of threatened chalk streams across the south of England. “The water companies have been allowed by the Environment Agency to over-abstract and deprive rivers of the very basic resource they need to survive: water,” he saysChalk streams are the northern hemisphere’s version of the Amazonian rainforest. “What hypocrisy that, as this country is chastising Brazil over fires in the Amazonian rainforest and criticising Indonesia about deforestation, we are destroying a globally rare resource in our own backyard,” Sharkey says.“We are working with water companies to protect water levels by limiting abstraction quantities.“We will continue to monitor conditions in the Cam catchment alongside carrying out a number of river restoration projects, and we are ready to respond to incidents caused by low water levels, including by rescuing fish in distress or oxygenating the water to help them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ad51b372b68d19223ea4fb9e078297d238438a5/0_96_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab66bd09e0785bcfa742fb165977828e","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Endangered white rhinos, breeding cycads and fires in the Amazon rainforest"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/183736d87e7c55223c5118740f57ab8df16edd80/928_342_3727_2236/master/3727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb3935479fa4df327a8a4111b6a1d617","title":"bollywood to depict indian air strikes on pakistan over kashmir bombing","story":"Vivek Oberoi movie will tell ‘true story’ of reprisals after February attack in which 40 Indian troops were killedBollywood is to make a movie based on the “true story” of Indian air strikes on Pakistan this year, its producer said, the latest patriotic film to hit the silver screen.The 26 February attack took place after a suicide bombing claimed by a militant group based in Pakistan killed 40 Indian troops on 14 February in Indian-controlled Kashmir.Pakistan then carried out its own raid over the de-facto border in Kashmir, before the two nuclear-armed countries stepped back from the brink of another conflict.India said that in the raid, its aircraft successfully attacked a training camp at Balakot and killed “a very large number” of “terrorists”, but doubts have been raised about its efficacy.At the time, Imran Khan, the Pakistani prime minister, said India’s claim that it had hit the Balakot camp was “a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim”.The new movie is set to be produced by Vivek Oberoi, who starred in a flattering biopic of prime minister Narendra Modi, the release of which was delayed so as not to interfere with this year’s election.It will also tell the story of handlebar-moustached Abhinandan Varthaman, an Indian pilot who was shot down in the raid and then handed over by Pakistan, becoming a national hero.“This film is a powerful tool to underline the achievements of brave officers like Wing Commander Abhinandan, who went behind the enemy lines and did what makes every Indian proud of them,” Oberoi was quoted as saying by Indian media.Kashmir has been ided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Both claim the Himalayan territory in full and have fought two wars over it.Earlier this month India stripped its part of the region’s autonomy, sending tens of thousands of extra troops and imposing a lockdown and a communications blackout that on Friday entered its 19th day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be5ab42b5a53f231e035dff8b5a2708b1d3f81d1/0_171_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d959dfbe4f0154894d579aee1d10e183","title":"liam charles recipe for messy eton traybake","story":"A simple sponge topped with that classic combination of meringue, berries and creamIt took me a while to like Eton mess – that classic combination of cream, berries and meringue.

Time has moved on, but my desire to eat those beans on any given day or night has not. Lucky for me, then, that they’re so easy to make at home ...These are two dishes in their own right, which I’ve brought together for a more satisfying meal, but you could make them separately, if you prefer – the corn cakes would be nice with srirachra mayo and the beans with rice and avocado.If you can’t find tinned pinto beans, use black beans or black-eyed beans instead.For the barbecue beans Rapeseed oil 1 large onion, peeled and chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1 tsp chipotle powder (or hot paprika)1 ½ tbsp dark brown sugar 1 tsp salt1 ½ tsp dijon mustard 1 tbsp cider vinegar 1 x 400g tin tomatoes, chopped2 tins pinto beans, undrainedFor the corn fritters 75g quick polenta50g plain flour 1 tsp chipotle powder (or hot paprika) ½ tsp baking powder 100ml non-dairy milk 4 corn cobs, boiled and kernels shaved or 2 x 198g tins of corn, drained4 spring onions, finely sliced¾ tsp salt Avocado, lime and coriander, to serveHeat three tablespoons of oil in a deep-sided frying pan on a moderate heat and, when hot, add the onion. Cook for 10-12 minutes, until soft and golden, then mix in the garlic. Cook for two minutes, then add the chipotle, sugar, salt, dijon, cider vinegar and tomatoes. Cook for about eight minutes, until the mixture is a bit jammy, then add the beans and their cooking water. Cook for a final 10 minutes, then taste, adjust the seasoning if need be, and take off the heat.To make the corn fritters, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Heat a nonstick frying pan over a medium heat, add a tablespoon of oil and, when hot, scoop an eighth of the mixture into the pan, packing it down as much as you can. Do the same again with as many as you can comfortably fit in – you might need to do a couple of batches. Press the fritters down gently to flatten them. Cook for three minutes, or until golden and crisp, then flip and cook for three minutes on the other side.

Try it grilled in its husk with a creamy pecorino dressing, in tamales, or with roast peppers and a soy-cured egg yolkEarlier sunsets and a shift in the wind tell me we’re approaching the end of the season and, as much as I hate to part with the sun, I am comforted by something else that’s bright, yellow and glowing: corn.Nothing much beats lightly cooked corn on the cob, drowned in butter and seasoned with flaky salt and a few chilli flakes. Better yet is sweetcorn so fresh, it needn’t be cooked at all.Tempting as it is to leave sweetcorn to its own devices, I cannot help but push further, creating whole meals that contrast between sweet and savoury, and the delicious space that opens up when they’re considerately paired. Corn husks are like nature’s little foil packets, only better. They allow the kernels to cook in their own steam and not dry out while they’re on the grill and, at the same time, take on the burning husks’ smoky aroma.Make sure you use the freshest corn you can find, because this really makes all the difference when cooking them in this way. If you can’t get corn cobs in their husks, blanch them lightly before grilling them and then spread with the dressing.4 corns on the cob, husks on2 tbsp parsley, roughly choppedFor the dressing2 large egg yolks1 tsp dijon mustard1½ tbsp lemon juice2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 anchovies, roughly chopped35g pecorino, finely grated, plus extra finely grated to serveBlack pepper100ml sunflower oil, plus extra for greasingMake the dressing: add the egg yolks, mustard, lemon, garlic, anchovies, pecorino and a very generous amount of black pepper to a food processor, and pulse a few times until well combined. With the machine running, drizzle in the oil in a slow and steady stream until completely incorporated and the dressing has a mayonnaise-like consistency.Put a well-greased large griddle pan on to a high heat, or light up your barbecue. Prepare the corn on the cob by gently pulling back the husks, leaving them attached at the base discard the silk by pulling at the threads.Rub a heaped tablespoon of the dressing on to each of the cobs, smoothing it out to coat the kernels. Pull up the husks to encase the corn again (don’t worry if some of it is exposed) and, once the grill is smoking, grill the corn, turning from time to time, until the husks are completely charred and the insides are tender – 15-20 minutes.To serve, pull down the husks again, and rub all over with some more of the dressing. Finish with a sprinkling of extra pecorino and the parsley, and serve with any extra dressing alongside.Tamales are little Mexican parcels of joy, made with maize flour (masa harina), wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves and steamed. I use baking paper, because it’s much easier to work with, but do try the husks if you don’t mind the challenge. Make this a complete spread with some lightly pickled red onions, guacamole and spicy homemade salsa.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 10 minMakes 6 as a starterFor the tamales4-6 small fresh corn cobs, kernels shaved off to get 500g, or 500g frozen corn kernels, defrosted 15g unsalted butter100ml double cream2 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and finely crushed100g masa harina1½ tsp sunflower oil 1 tsp baking powder1 egg, beaten60g mature cheddar, grated60g mozzarella block, grated1 lime, cut into 6 wedges, to serveFor the chilli oil 2 tsp chipotle flakes2 tsp red bell pepper flakes 60ml sunflower oilSaltFor the chilli oil, lightly toast the chipotle and pepper flakes in a small frying pan on a medium-high heat for a minute, until fragrant, then add the oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Heat for about 30 seconds, until the oil bubbles gently, then remove from the heat and leave to infuse.For the tamales, blitz the corn in a food processor until you get a wet mash. Add the butter to a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once melted, add the corn, cream, a teaspoon of cumin and a teaspoon of salt. Cook for three minutes, stirring a few times, until the corn is cooked through and has the consistency of porridge.Remove from the heat and leave to cool for five minutes, then add the masa harina, oil, baking powder and egg, and mix well it should have the consistency of Play-Doh.Cut six rectangles of baking paper, each 25 x 16cm. With lightly oiled hands, take 110g of the dough and shape into a smooth ball. Put this ball in the middle of one of the paper pieces, and flatten into a 15 x 9cm rectangle.Combine the cheeses in a small bowl with the remaining teaspoon of cumin, then place 20g cheese mixture along the centre of the dough. Use your hands to mould the dough over to enclose the cheese on all sides, pinching and smoothing the dough with your fingers so there are no cracks, to get a 12 x 6cm rectangle. Fold the paper on all sides to enclose the tamale, using the paper to help you shape it, then put the parcel seam-side down on a tray. Repeat with the rest of the dough.Put a large saucepan, for which you have a fitted steaming basket and lid, on a high heat with plenty of water. Once boiling, put the tamales seam-side down in the steaming basket (you may have to pile some on top of each other, which is fine). Cover with the lid, turn the heat to medium and steam for 30 minutes. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then unwrap and discard the paper.Serve the tamales on a platter with the chilli oil drizzled on top and lime wedges to squeeze alongside.The cured egg yolk, which is a cinch to make, adds richness and colour to this meal in a bowl. I urge you to try it in polentas and pastas, even if you’re not going to make this whole dish. The polenta will set quite quickly, so it is best made just before serving. Roast and marinate the peppers up to three days before, if you like.70ml soy sauce4 good-quality, rich-yolk eggs12 small, mixed red, orange and yellow Romano peppers, stalks on (ie 1.1kg)Salt and black pepper1 whole garlic bulb, top trimmed to expose the cloves, plus 2 extra cloves, skin left on and crushed with the side of a knife1 tbsp maple syrup1 tsp apple cider vinegar10g thyme sprigs1 lemon, zest finely grated to get ½ tsp, remaining skin finely shaved, to get 5 strips60ml olive oil, plus extra to serve5g basil, finely shreddedFor the polenta4-6 small fresh corn cobs, kernels shaved off (500g), or 500g frozen corn kernels, defrosted 40g unsalted butter180g Greek-style yoghurt40g parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serve100g quick-cook polentaPut the soy sauce in a medium bowl. Separate the eggs, carefully adding the yolks to the bowl of soy sauce (save the whites for another recipe) and leave the yolks to cure for two and a half hours, very gently turning them halfway with a spoon. Don’t cure the yolks for any longer you want them to stay soft.Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. Put the peppers on a large, paper-lined tray, spreading out as much as possible. Sprinkle the whole garlic bulb with a little salt and pepper , wrap tightly in foil and add to the tray with the peppers. Roast for 20 minutes, then carefully turn the peppers over and roast for another 10 minutes, until cooked through and blackened in places.Put the peppers in a large bowl with the crushed raw garlic, maple syrup, vinegar, thyme, lemon skin, oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Once cool enough to handle, unwrap the cooked garlic and squeeze the cloves out into the bowl with the peppers, discarding the papery skin. Gently mix this into the peppers, keeping the stalks intact, cover with a large plate and leave to marinate for at least an hour, or overnight.While the peppers are marinating, add the corn to a food processor and blitz to a wet paste. Transfer to a large saute pan with the butter, yoghurt, parmesan, one and three-quarter teaspoons of salt and 500ml water. Cook for seven minutes on a medium heat, then turn the heat to low. Sprinkle in the polenta, stirring constantly for another five minutes to avoid lumps, until cooked.Divide the polenta between four bowls, then top with three peppers each, drizzling some of the marinade over, but avoiding the aromatics. Carefully lift a yolk out of the soy sauce and place on the polenta, next to the peppers. Finish with a good drizzle of oil, along with the basil, lemon zest, a sprinkle of salt, a good grind of pepper and some freshly grated parmesan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/128aa4a50304e8203f8ded3a8ae44c414d885c2a/0_33_5568_3342/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc75cf87290f33525ea00503967f680a","title":"efl bury 5pm tuesday campbell takeover","story":"The English Football League has given Bury until Tuesday for their owner, Steve Dale, to conclude a sale, or the club will be expelled from the league after 125 years of membership.Dale received a takeover offer in principle on Friday night from the directors of a sporting data and analytics company, C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk, including Rory Campbell, the son of the former Labour party communications director Alastair. In a statement released after the EFL board took time to consider the news, the league said it was not prepared to extend the deadline any further than Tuesday because of the impact on the competition.The EFL has suspended Bury’s first five scheduled matches of the season in League One because of Dale’s failure, since his £1 takeover of the club in December, to provide the evidence required by league rules that he has the funding for the club to meet its commitments. The EFL’s executive chair, Debbie Jevans, emphasised on Thursday that it will already be difficult for those five fixtures to be rescheduled given the crowded calendar of a 24-club ision, hence the board’s refusal to allow any further postponement of matches for extended takeover negotiations.In a statement made on Friday night, Campbell, 32, and Henry Newman, 30, the directors of C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk, said they had been in discussions for 10 weeks about buying Bury, but that they needed an extension to the midnight deadline because “it is a very complicated scenario and there remain a number of outstanding legal and other issues that have to be addressed”.Having considered that position on Saturday morning, the EFL said in its statement: “The board has fully considered the information that has been made available by C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk and whilst no formal sale has been completed, despite reports to the contrary, enough credible information was presented to allow the board to agree to work exclusively with the club and C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk over this bank holiday weekend in an attempt to finalise the change of control and achieve a positive outcome for Bury FC.“The EFL board, however, remains firmly of the view that the League cannot be in a position whereby any more of the club’s 2019-20 fixtures will be suspended due to the integrity of the competition, the impact on other clubs in the League and therefore has stated that matters must be concluded by 5pm on Tuesday 27 August 2019.“If in the event a successful outcome is not achieved by this point, then Bury FC’s share in the EFL will be withdrawn and its membership in the League will come to an end.”Jevans described this extension of four days over the bank holiday as “a final effort to allow the club the opportunity to survive”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/100dcaf69e82d3db85eb02017cc49a339309e3c6/76_0_3360_2015/master/3360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=befcd1710353aeddc1896c8f3aea6e33","title":"manchester united v crystal palace watford v west ham and more live","story":"The world clock through the prism of Sheffield United’s twitter page.Full-time at Carrow Road.

Plenty of belters on here but where are The Specials? Coventry’s finest, no? Let’s do this. It’s a little while yet until those clocks hit 3pm but, in the meantime, there’s a humdinger of a game going on at Carrow Road. Given that both teams can’t defend, you won’t be surprised to learn that Norwich and Chelsea shared four goals in the opening 45 minutes. Follow the action here with Barry Glendenning’s live minute-by-minute report:Manchester United have the opportunity to go top of the table – for a few hours at least before the 5.30pm BST Anfield showdown between Liverpool and Arsenal – when they host Crystal Palace.Palace took four points from their two visits to Manchester last season, Andros Townsend’s volley from the gods securing a shock 3-2 win at City while there was a rather less memorable 0-0 draw at United. Speaking of the latter, Palace are pleasing fans of binary sequences but not their own supporters after scorelines of 0-0 and 0-1 so far, their lack of goals a familiar problem.The Wan-Bissaka derby is one of four 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League …It’s Brighton v Southampton down on the south coast. Graham Potter’s reign at the Amex has already got off to a flying start with four points out of six but Ralph Hasenhüttl’s stock is down after a pair of back-to-back defeats. Brighton have won just one of their last 10 meetings with Southampton so Saints hold the historical edge.Like Brighton, Sheffield United have also collected four points from their opening two fixtures. They continue their bid to sneak into mid-table while no-one is looking with a home game against top six wannabes Leicester. Brendan Rodgers’s side drew 0-0 at home to Wolves and looked menacing in a 1-1 draw at Chelsea last time. They need to up the goal count though and boyhood Sheffield Wednesday fan Jamie Vardy would be particularly happy to open his account for the season against the Blades.Watford v West Ham completes the 3pm Premier League offering. The alphabet put both in the relegation zone of the pre-season table but Watford have decided to stay there after back-to-back defeats. West Ham have a point but were thrashed 5-0 by Manchester City on opening day. Good luck predicting this one. Both sides’ form can oscillate wildly and, for no good reason, West Ham won 4-1 at Vicarage Road last season.On the subject of teams in claret and blue, Aston Villa banked their first points of the season with a 2-0 home win over Everton in the Friday night game.In the Championship, it’s good news if you play in a white shirt (the Charlatans’ most underrated song?). Leeds, Swansea and Fulham occupy the top three places and, while wickets tumble at Headingley, Marcelo Bielsa’s West Yorkshire outfit hope to skittle rock-bottom Stoke. Fulham host Nottingham Forest but Swansea can put their legs up for the afternoon ahead of their home clash with Birmingham on Sunday.Blackpool lead the way in League One and the Seasiders make the short trip to mid-table Rochdale. Speaking of the north-west, Crewe top League Two and bid to stay there with three points from their trip to Newport.In Scotland, Celtic and Rangers have maximum points and 20 goals between them. Yes, after just two matches apiece! Both play on Sunday but we’ll have updates from the other four Scottish Premiership games, including third-placed Ross County at home to Livingston.And don’t forget Europe too. Borussia Dortmund moved three points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-1 win at Cologne on Friday night while Bayern Munich, who failed to win their opener, are away to Schalke in a 5.30pm BST kick-off.And let’s all cheer on Union Berlin, who got a rather rude awakening on their Bundesliga bow last Saturday when being tonked 4-0 at home by Leipzig. They hope for better fortunes away to Augsburg in one of five 2.30pm BST fixtures in the German top flight. Nick Ames told Union Berlin’s story last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f46a412020a7984f3b0c9affc2e07c0308713bee/0_0_2905_1743/master/2905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abdd5a5061d9b0ca48b782b6a327c00a","title":"norwich city v chelsea premier league live","story":"Tammy Abraham: “It’s something I’ve always dreamed of,” says Chelsea’s striker in an interview with BT Sport, upon asked how he feels after scoring his first goals for Chelsea, 15 years – and 60 goals on loan at other teams - after joining the club. “Getting in the first team and scoring. I was always confident I could do it.”Chelsea win: Frank Lampard and his players milk the applause of the travelling fans before heading to the sanctuary of the dressing-room. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over at Carrow Road, where Chelsea have won an entertaining game by the odd goal of five. Frank Lampard has secured his first win as Chelsea manager, while Tammy Abraham scored twice to get off the mark for the season. Mason Mount also scored his second in two games for Chelsea, before hobbling off lame. Norwich played quite impressively too, coming from behind twice in the first half courtesy of goals from Todd Cantwell and Teemu Pukki.90+4 min: Willian tries his luck, but fires wide from distance. Now Kurt Zouma is down injured, having hurt the small of his back after leaping to contest a high ball. 90+3 min: Ross Barkley wins a corner for Chelsea after a shot from distance is tipped wide of the upright by Tim Krul. Nothing comes of the set-piece.90+1 min: We’re into the first of five added minutes. Can Chelsea hang on for a victory that ultimately they deserve? After a very even first half, they’ve dominated since the break. For all that, their defence is a bit of a mess and needs a lot of work. The imminent return of Antonio Rudiger should help.88 min: Mason Mount goes down injured and there are raucous boos as Norwich put the ball out of play. Mount appears to have injured his thigh and is going to be replaced by Marcos Alonso. 86 min: Ben Godfrey leaves one in on Mason Mount, stamping on his instep with a late challenge. It’s a definite yellow card offence and possibly a red. Following a VAR check, he escapes with any censure. I’m not sure what the lads in VAR Towers are drinking this afternoon, but I wouldn’t mind a drop of it. Chelsea substitution: Willian on for Christian Pulisic.84 min: According to BT Sport’s referee-in-residence Peter Walton, Martin Atkinson initially awarded a goal to Kurt Zouma, only for VAR to urge him to change his mind, because Olivier Giroud had backed into Tim Krul as the goalkeeper tried to catch a ball dropping out of the sky. That wasn’t the way I read the situation and I’m convinced Giroud didn’t foul Krul. Norwich triple-substitution: Kenny McClean, Mario Vrancic and Dennis Srbeny on for Moritz Leitner, Tom Trybull and Marco Stiepermann. 78 min: Kurt Zouma bundles the ball home after Tim Krul had leaped to catch it, only to fumble under pressure from Olivier Giroud, who had leapt in front of him but didn’t make contact with the goalkeeper. No goal is awarded, despite a VAR consultation. It looked a perfectly fine goal to me, but as we all know, strikers aren’t allowed jump in the same postal code as goalkeepers without the man in gloves getting a free-kick. 76 min: Good play from Mason Mount, who dummies a low cross from Pulisic to let the ball run on to Ross Barkley just outside the penalty area. He shoots and his effort is on target, but is blocked by Ben Godfrey. 75 min: Chelsea substitution: Tammy Abraham goes off to be replaced by Olivier Giroud. He gets a standing ovation from the travelling Chelsea fans.74 min: Free-kick for Norwich after a Pulisic foul on Cantwell. Nothing comes of it. 72 min: Ben Godfrey wins a corner after a rampaging run up the inside left and then almost scores, hitting the cross-bar after getting on the end of the ensuing inswinger. 71 min: Tammy Abraham has answered a few of his critics, me among them, with his brace today. Those two goals will do wonders for his confidence, as I suspect he was beginning to feel a bit of pressure after drawing blanks in his opening three games. Chelsea retake the lead. Tammy Abraham picks up a Pulisic pass from midfield, takes the ball away from Grant Hanley with an excellent first touch and advances towards the edge of the penalty area. From there, he shoots low into the bottom left-hand corner.66 min: Ross Barkley tries his luck with a shot from distance. He fires straight at Tim Krul. 64 min: The more I see of that Stiepermann challenge on Azpilicueta, the more baffling I find it that the ref’s original decision to ignore it wasn’t overturned on the advice of the men in VAR HQ. It was a clear foul on the Chelsea full-back.61 min: Cesar Azpilicueta is unhappy with referee Martin Atkinson. He feels he should have had a spot-kick after being caught on the knee by a Marco Stiepermann challenge in the Norwich City penalty area. It seems that VAR have had a look at it but didn’t think it was worth overturning. It looked a stone-wall penalty to me.61 min: A promising Norwich counter-attack is stopped by a good tackle by Mateo Kovacic on Teemu Pukki. 60 min: Chelsea win a corner. Mount curls the ball towards the far post, but Tim Krul comes off his line to punch it clear. 59 min: Mount tries a shot from distance, but his effort is blocked too. 57 min: More Chelsea dominance. Azpilicueta shoots from just inside the Norwich penalty area, but Ben Godfrey blocks. Moments later, Ross Barkley dances past four Norwich defenders to tee up Azpilicueta for another shot, which fizzes wide. Norwich are really under the cosh here.56 min: Emerson tries to pick out Tammy Abraham with a cross from the left, but Grant Hanley out-jumps the striker to clear. 55 min: Chelsea have dominated the first 10 minutes of the second half, but chances have been few and far between as they struggle to create scoring opportunities. 54 min: Excellent from Todd Cantwell, who tracks back to dispossess Cesar Azpilicueta in a dangerous position on the right flank. 52 min: There’s a break in play as Marco Stiepermann receives treatment for an injury to his hand sustained in a robust coming-together with Kurt Zouma. 50 min: Norwich fans have just spent the 49th minute applauding in a tribute to David Powell, one of their number who recently died in a car accident. 49 min: A Jorginho shot from distance takes a deflection and goes out for a corner. Mason Mount swings the ball into the mixer, where Azpilicueta gets in front of Ben Godfrey and flicks a header over the bar. 47 min: Jamal Lewis intercepts a Cesar Azpilicueta pass, but Norwich lose possession again. With Lewis in possession, the ball’s played to Chrsitian Pulisic, who opts not to square the ball for Tammy Abraham and fires wide from a tight angle instead. Abraham is understandably unhappy with his team-mate. Norwich’s defending in the early stages of this second half has been slapstick. 46 min: Norwich get the second half started, with no changes in personnel on either side. Here’s hoping for a second half that’s just as entertaining as the first. Mason Mount drags an early shot wide after Ross Barkley steals possession in the Norwich half. Peep! Both sides go in for the break after a massively entertaining first half. Tammy Abraham opened toe scoring for Chelsea, only to have his effort cancelled out just over two minutes later by Todd Cantwell. Chelsea went ahead again through Mason Mount, only for Teemu Pukki to restore parity with his fifth goal in three Premier League games. Both sides have looked great going forward, but rather kamikaze at the back. There’ll be more goals in this game - mark my words.45+1 min: Norwich gallop upfield on the counter-attack from the corner. The ball’s played upfield for Teemu Pukki to chase, but Kepa reads the situation well and is quick out of his penalty area to clear the ball and the danger. 45 min: Jamal Lewis makes a crucial block from Christian Pulisic, who controlled a pass into the Norwich penalty area beautifully before unleashing a shot from about seven yards out. Corner for Chelsea.44 min: Marco Stipermann is booked for a challenge on Jorginho in which he appeared to win the ball. I suppose it makes up for the card he avoided earlier.43 min: Grant Hanley tries to pick out Todd Cantwell with a long ball up the pitch. his attempt to sprint in behind the Chelsea defence is thwarted by Kurt Zouma.41 min: Moritz Leitner puts the ball out of play for a Chelsea throw-in deep in Norwich territory, dispossessing Mason Mount in the process.38 min: With options to his left and right, Ross Barkley tries a shot from the edge of the Norwich penalty area. The ball takes a deflection, loops up in the air and drops for Christian Pulisic on the byline. He’s unable to control it under pressure from Grant Hanley and puts it out for a goal-kick. 34 min: It’s one from the training ground, as Stiepermann touches the ball to Buendia, who advances several strides closer to goal before unleashing a shot. Kepa parries his effort and the ball drops to Grant Hanley. He shoots the rebound straight at the goalkeeper. A let-off for Chelsea, who are almost as bad in defence as their opponents.34 min: Jorginho is booked for a late lunge on Emi Buendia. Norwich City have a free-kick wide on the right.31 min: Teemu Pukki gets goal side of Kurt Zouma, just about staying onside to get on a wonderful defence-splitting through ball from Buendia. From a tight angle, he hits a low diagonal shot goalwards. Kepa gets a decent touch on it but is unable to prevent the ball slowly rolling over the line. It’s a good finish from the Finn, but Chelsea’s goalkeeper should have kept it out.

I don’t think either of us expected to be living in a flatshare for this long. It’s partly down to failed relationships, but also to the fact that neither of us has prioritised saving for a house deposit.We’ve lived together long enough to just pick up where the other isn’t so great – for instance, Alex is terrible with admin, so I sort all our bills she does the practical things like buying cleaning supplies or fixing the TV stand. We’ve found that one of the tricks to assuring domestic bliss is a cleaner who comes once a week. Our longest tenancy was over five years, but we recently moved into a new flat – this is the first place that really feels like a home.We both assumed we’d be living alone by now, but instead of saving we spend all our money on wine subscriptions, Amazon, house plants, expensive gyms, vegan takeaways. London rent is wildly expensive and house prices make you sick saving is difficult and feels pointless. So here we are, bumbling along together. Our relationship is the most long-standing and significant in my life. Living with Elli has taught me a lot about space and boundaries namely that Elli needs more of the former than me. So I’ve learned to knock before entering and not to talk during Line Of Duty. Still, when I’m having a bad day she doesn’t mind if I lie on her bed like a fat, needy labrador.

What if it never grows back?I noticed recently that my beard was looking a little less “deliberate aesthetic decision” and decidedly more “just released from a Thai prison”, so I accepted it was time to give it a trim before we headed off on holiday.I have a slight issue with beard trimming, in that one of my eyes is much, much better at its core function (seeing things) than the other. Therefore, one side of my face is much more likely to look good than the other. I have lost count of the number of times that I have assumed the beard to be perfect, only to put on my glasses and see that I look like I am wearing some sort of furry chinstrap. (You may think I should wear the glasses while trimming alas, this is an inelegant solution unless I purchase lab goggles, as I need to see beyond the range of normal specs.)I have managed to get fairly good at working around my beard blind spot, but this week I allowed complacency to get the better of me. I got out the clippers and was working on my good-vision side when I decided to give the beard border by my ear a super-crisp finish instead I went straight through the beard mainland by mistake. Almost every beard wearer will know this feeling. You look in the mirror in silent panic, debating whether the situation can be rescued or whether you are going to be forced to commit beard hara-kiri. I quickly assessed the situation to be beyond repair and so, using my tears as clipper lubricant, got rid of the beard completely. I was sans chin squirrel for the first time in a decade. I looked at the stranger in the mirror and wondered how my family would respond. Would my wife find me attractive any more? Was the “any more” in that question necessary? Would my kids find it weird? This would be the first time in their lives they would be seeing me clean-shaven.I opened the bathroom door to reveal the devastation to my wife. She looked me up and down and said: “This is all we’re going to hear about on holiday, isn’t it?” My eldest son said: “It doesn’t look awful, but it doesn’t look good.” My middle son begged me to grow it back. Our youngest son didn’t notice a thing.My wife has been laughing at the level of my overreaction ever since, seemingly forgetting that when her hairdresser once cut her hair shorter than normal we had to hold a memorial service. But I just can’t get used to it. I don’t mind looking slightly different what I do mind is looking in the mirror and seeing my dead father looking back at me.I now have horrible bits of grey stubble coming through. When I went out with my friends the other night, I had to give them a 10-minute amnesty to essentially roast my face. One of them told me that I seemed less funny without a beard. Could this affect my career? What if it never grows back? These are all questions I asked my wife when I got home that night and, frankly, she is proving pretty insensitive about the whole thing.I also seem to have been rendered completely unrecognisable. Someone recently asked me to pose for a photograph with them, and her friend spent the whole interaction trying to convince her that I was some sort of imposter. Without the beard, I feel like one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f91cd24f75659013c05090a9c2ec7862f2df10e7/0_375_4316_2590/master/4316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89695e7093bcd84df313278946250898","title":"taylor swift lover album review","story":"(Republic)After the hard edges of 2017’s Reputation, Swift’s latest album revisits the catchy pop and romantic concerns that made her nameTaylor Swift is more of a lover than a fighter. The singer-songwriter doesn’t say it out loud on her seventh album – the successor to 2017’s Reputation, an aggressive record in which she came out swinging – but it’s hard to escape the conclusion on a record that Swift is calling “a love letter to love”. “I’m in my feelings more than Drake, so, yeah,” she winks at one point.Reputation’s murky mood board went big on snakes, bling and shade thrown and received, the aftermath of a highly public feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West. By contrast, Lover is a kitsch-leaning festival of humour, pastels, butterflies and the desire not to be defined by negatives. It is, in large parts, a hoot.For a songwriter of such control and emotional intelligence, Swift is rather over-partial to obvious juxtapositions – her lyrics often hinge sharply on roses and thorns, sunshine and rain. Daylight, the 18th and final track on this long album, finds Swift waking from “20 years of sleep”.But her binaries aren’t always absolute. You get the feeling that if the “old Taylor” was “dead” at the start of the Reputation era, she was only ever in suspended animation, in a kind of R\u0026ampB-adjacent fever dream. Lover returns to business as usual, the dramatic pop of 1989 via the confessionals of Red. Swift is back in her happy place, writing finger-snapping pop songs about falling in and out of love, abetted by a variety of producers, two of whom now ping-pong regularly between her and Lorde: Jack Antonoff, producer of Lorde’s 2017 album Melodrama and lots of Swift’s last two albums and Joel Little, the midwife to Lorde’s early work. Trailers such as ME! – a duet with Panic! at the Disco’s Brendon Urie that verges on a cheerleader chant – and You Need to Calm Down, a fabulously pitched takedown of haters, bigots and internet trolls, have exuded playfulness, tunefulness and wit in equal measure.An album so long is bound to be a mixed bag. Strong opener I Forgot That You Existed is a breezy kiss-off to an old flame or, perhaps the whole Kimye era: “Lived in the shade you were throwing till all of my sunshine was gone,” Swift recounts.By track 11, though, Swift is hymning her current flame, the British actor Joe Alwyn, who “took her back to Highgate” to “meet all of his best mates” on a cringe-inducing song called London Boy. This sort of thing might pass on one side of the Atlantic but, on the other side, it is redolent of Guy Ritchie-era Madonna in her tweeds drinking bitter. (In Swift’s partial defence, the song expresses a desire to see Hackney, “not just Louis V on Bond Street”.)For every reasonable assumption of a return to form, however, there’s the suspicion that Lover might be at least a partial retrenchment until Swift decides what to do next. If it sounds as if we’ve been here before, it’s because we have. Many of Lover’s songs are recognisable in structure and content from albums past, with Swift’s signature shouty endings, her key changes that keep things moving along and her carefully deployed lyrical detail all to the fore. Anticipatory tunes such as I Think He Knows and Paper Rings flirt hard, but perhaps not quite as hard as 1989’s magisterial Blank Space did. “Who could ever leave me darling,” sings Swift on The Archer, a moodier, more elliptical track, “but who could stay?” – revisiting the idea of Swift being a romantic handful, present on Blank Space and other songs passim. Lover, the title track itself, is a perfectly good ballad, light on detail but with a fantastic pregnant gap in its dynamic and a husk to Swift’s voice that could grow to become more interesting.The heart, not unreasonably, takes up a fair amount of airtime on Lover, but Swift has other concerns. There’s fight left in her, too, in the form of The Man, a bouncy Joel Little production where Swift decries the double standards by which high-profile females are judged. In an alternative reality, she’s “an alpha” making “power moves”, and not hung out to dry for dating a succession of men.Soon You’ll Get Better, by contrast, is a stark song set in a doctor’s office that is likely to allude to Swift’s mother, whose cancer has returned. The track features backing vocals, banjo and fiddle by two Dixie Chicks, a country outfit whose opposition to the Iraq war landed them in hot water with US conservatives during the George W Bush administration. Their presence is indicative of some heavy signalling by Swift, who has been criticised for not being clearer about her own politics.You Need to Calm Down is pretty unequivocal about LGBTQ+ advocacy. More coded, perhaps, is a song called Miss Americana \u0026amp the Heartbreak Prince, in which Swift deploys a high-school setting and lines about her own “pageant smile” to land some allegorical content. “American glory  Faded before me  Now I’m feeling hopeless  Ripping up my prom dress”, it goes, voicing a generalised distress at the state of her nation.Swift’s tanker has been slow to turn round, and is still turning. It’s said that celebrities remain stunted at the age at which they became famous, a kernel of truth that Swift seems strangely keen to emphasise. The four bonus editions of Lover come with journals, which mix entries from Swift’s own diaries, from her teenage years and beyond, that detail attempts in 2007 to locate a turkey fryer to the aftermath of Kanye West’s 2009 VMA awards hijack. There are blank pages for fans to fill in. At nearly 30, the singer-songwriter remains an intriguing mixture of industry power-broker and giddy cat-obsessive. Lover is fine with that, but the real battle is where she goes after this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83802285cf32c99e68f311fc1ab9f4f32d2fd2c1/1449_62_13122_7873/master/13122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44d1476f0b0bb3db26d1949977be9f79","title":"taylor swift pop music hunger games gladiators","story":"The singer spills on feuds, fame, failure – and why she’s taking on TrumpTaylor Swift’s Nashville apartment is an Etsy fever dream, a 365-days-a-year Christmas shop, pure teenage girl id. You enter through a vestibule clad in blue velvet and covered in gilt frames bursting with fake flowers. The ceiling is painted like the night sky. Above a koi pond in the living area, a narrow staircase spirals six feet up towards a giant, pillow-lagged birdcage that probably has the best view in the city. Later, Swift will tell me she needs metaphors “to understand anything that happens to me”, and the birdcage defies you not to interpret it as a pointed comment on the contradictions of stardom.Swift, wearing pale jeans and dip-dyed shirt, her sandy hair tied in a blue scrunchie, leads the way up the staircase to show me the view. The decor hasn’t changed since she bought this place in 2009, when she was 19. “All of these high rises are new since then,” she says, gesturing at the squat glass structures and cranes. Meanwhile her oven is still covered in stickers, more teenage diary than adult appliance.Now 29, she has spent much of the past three years living quietly in London with her boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn, making the penthouse a kind of time capsule, a monument to youthful naivety given an unlimited budget – the years when she sang about Romeo and Juliet and wore ballgowns to awards shows before she moved to New York and honed her slick, self-mythologising pop.It is mid-August. This is Swift’s first UK interview in more than three years, and she seems nervous: neither presidential nor goofy (her usual defaults), but quick with a tongue-out “ugh” of regret or frustration as she picks at her glittery purple nails. We climb down from the birdcage to sit by the pond, and when the conversation turns to 2016, the year the wheels came off for her, Swift stiffens as if driving over a mile of speed bumps. After a series of bruising public spats (with Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj) in 2015, there was a high-profile standoff with Kanye West. The news that she was in a relationship with actor Tom Hiddleston, which leaked soon after, was widely dismissed as a ersionary tactic. Meanwhile, Swift went to court to prosecute a sexual assault claim, and faced a furious backlash when she failed to endorse a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, allowing the alt-right to adopt her as their “Aryan princess”.Her critics assumed she cared only about the bottom line. The reality, Swift says, is that she was totally broken. “Every domino fell,” she says bitterly. “It became really terrifying for anyone to even know where I was. And I felt completely incapable of doing or saying anything publicly, at all. Even about my music. I always said I wouldn’t talk about what was happening personally, because that was a personal time.” She won’t get into specifics. “I just need some things that are mine,” she despairs. “Just some things.”A year later, in 2017, Swift released her album Reputation, half high-camp heel turn, drawing on hip-hop and vaudeville (the brilliantly hammy Look What You Made Me Do), half stunned appreciation that her nascent relationship with Alwyn had weathered the storm (the soft, sensual pop of songs Delicate and Dress).Her new album, Lover, her seventh, was released yesterday. It’s much lighter than Reputation: Swift likens writing it to feeling like “I could take a full deep breath again”. Much of it is about Alwyn: the Galway Girl-ish track London Boy lists their favourite city haunts and her newfound appreciation of watching rugby in the pub with his uni mates on the ruminative Afterglow, she asks him to forgive her anxious tendency to assume the worst.While she has always written about relationships, they were either teenage fantasy or a postmortem on a high-profile breakup, with exes such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Harry Styles. But she and Alwyn have seldom been pictured together, and their relationship is the only other thing she won’t talk about. “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion,” she says, laughing after I attempt a stealthy angle. “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it – but it’s just that it goes out into the world. That’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable.”Meanwhile, her recent single You Need To Calm Down admonished homophobes and namechecked US LGBTQ rights organisation Glaad (which then saw increased donations). Swift filled her video with cameos from queer stars such as Ellen DeGeneres and Queen singer Adam Lambert, and capped it with a call to sign her petition in support of the Equality Act, which if passed would prohibit gender- and sexuality-based discrimination in the US. A video of Polish LGBTQ fans miming the track in defiance of their government’s homophobic agenda went viral. But Swift was accused of “queerbaiting” and bandwagon-jumping. You can see how she might find it hard to work out what, exactly, people want from her.It was girlhood that made Swift a multimillionaire. When country music’s gatekeepers swore that housewives were the only women interested in the genre, she proved them wrong. Her self-titled debut marked the longest stay on the Billboard 200 by any album released in the decade. A potentially cloying image – corkscrew curls, lyrics thick on “daddy” and down-home values – were undercut by the fact she was evidently, endearingly, a bit of a freak, an unusual combination of intensity and artlessness. Also, she was really, really good at what she did, and not just for a teenager: her entirely self-written third album, 2010’s Speak Now, is unmatched in its devastatingly withering dismissals of awful men.She describes the way she burned bridges in 2016 as a kind of obliviousness. “I didn’t realise it was like a classic overthrow of someone in power – where you didn’t realise the whispers behind your back, you didn’t realise the chain reaction of events that was going to make everything fall apart at the exact, perfect time for it to fall apart.”Here’s that chain reaction in full. With her 2014 album 1989 (the year she was born), Swift transcended country stardom, becoming as ubiquitous as Beyoncé. For the first time she vocally embraced feminism, something she had rejected in her teens but, after a while, it seemed to amount to not much more than a lot of pictures of her hanging out with her “squad”, a bevy of supermodels, musicians and Lena Dunham. The squad very much did not include her former friend Katy Perry, whom Swift targeted in her song Bad Blood, as part of what seemed like a painfully overblown dispute about some backing dancers. Then, when Nicki Minaj tweeted that MTV’s 2015 Video Music awards had rewarded white women at the expense of women of colour, multiple-nominee Swift took it personally, responding: “Maybe one of the men took your slot.” For someone prone to talking about the haters, she quickly became her own worst enemy.Her old adversary Kanye West resurfaced in February 2016. In 2009, West had invaded Swift’s stage at the MTV VMAs to protest against her victory over Beyoncé in the female video of the year category. It remains the peak of interest in Swift on Google Trends, and the conflict between them has become such a cornerstone of celebrity journalism that it’s hard to remember it lay dormant for nearly seven years – until West released his song Famous. “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” he rapped. “Why? I made that bitch famous.” The video depicted a Swift mannequin naked in bed with men including Trump.Swift loudly condemned both although she had discussed the track with West, she said she had never agreed to the “bitch” lyric or the video. West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, released a heavily edited clip that showed Swift at least agreeing to the “sex” line on the phone with West, if not the “bitch” part. Swift pleaded the technicality, but it made no difference: when Kardashian went on Twitter to describe her as a snake, the comparison stuck and the singer found herself very publicly “cancelled” – the incident taken as “proof” of Swift’s insincerity. So she went away.Swift says she stopped trying to explain herself, even though she “definitely” could have. As she worked on Reputation, she was also writing “a think-piece a day that I knew I would never publish: the stuff I would say, and the different facets of the situation that nobody knew”. If she could exonerate herself, why didn’t she? She leans forward. “Here’s why,” she says conspiratorially. “Because when people are in a hate frenzy and they find something to mutually hate together, it bonds them. And anything you say is in an echo chamber of mockery.”She compares that year to being hit by a tidal wave. “You can either stand there and let the wave crash into you, and you can try as hard as you can to fight something that’s more powerful and bigger than you,” she says. “Or you can e under the water, hold your breath, wait for it to pass and while you’re down there, try to learn something. Why was I in that part of the ocean? There were clearly signs that said: Rip tide! Undertow! Don’t swim! There are no lifeguards!” She’s on a roll. “Why was I there? Why was I trusting people I trusted? Why was I letting people into my life the way I was letting them in? What was I doing that caused this?”After the incident with Minaj, her critics started pointing out a narrative of “white victimhood” in Swift’s career. Speaking slowly and carefully, she says she came to understand “a lot about how my privilege allowed me to not have to learn about white privilege. I didn’t know about it as a kid, and that is privilege itself, you know? And that’s something that I’m still trying to educate myself on every day. How can I see where people are coming from, and understand the pain that comes with the history of our world?” She also accepts some responsibility for her overexposure, and for some of the tabloid drama. If she didn’t wish a friend happy birthday on Instagram, there would be reports about severed friendships, even if they had celebrated together. “Because we didn’t post about it, it didn’t happen – and I realised I had done that,” she says. “I created an expectation that everything in my life that happened, people would see.”But she also says she couldn’t win. “I’m kinda used to being gaslit by now,” she drawls wearily. “And I think it happens to women so often that, as we get older and see how the world works, we’re able to see through what is gaslighting. So I’m able to look at 1989 and go – KITTIES!” She breaks off as an assistant walks in with Swift’s three beloved cats, stars of her Instagram feed, back from the vet before they fly to England this week. Benjamin, Olivia and Meredith haughtily circle our feet (they are scared of the koi) as Swift resumes her train of thought, back to the release of 1989 and the subsequent fallout. “Oh my God, they were mad at me for smiling a lot and quote-unquote acting fake. And then they were mad at me that I was upset and bitter and kicking back.” The rules kept changing.Swift’s new album comes with printed excerpts from her diaries. On 29 August 2016, she wrote in her girlish, bubble writing: “This summer is the apocalypse.” As the incident with West and Kardashian unfolded, she was preparing for her court case against radio DJ David Mueller, who was fired in 2013 after Swift reported him for putting his hand up her dress at a meet-and–greet event. He sued her for defamation she countersued for sexual assault.“Having dealt with a few of them, narcissists basically subscribe to a belief system that they should be able to do and say whatever the hell they want, whenever the hell they want to,” Swift says now, talking at full pelt. “And if we – as anyone else in the world, but specifically women – react to that, well, we’re not allowed to. We’re not allowed to have a reaction to their actions.”In summer 2016 she was in legal depositions, practising her testimony. “You’re supposed to be really polite to everyone,” she says. But by the time she got to court in August 2017, “something snapped, I think”. She laughs. Her testimony was sharp and uncompromising. She refused to allow Mueller’s lawyers to blame her or her security guards when asked if she could see the incident, Swift said no, because “my ass is in the back of my body”. It was a brilliant, rude defence.“You’re supposed to behave yourself in court and say ‘rear end’,” she says with mock politesse. “The other lawyer was saying, ‘When did he touch your backside?’ And I was like, ‘ASS! Call it what it is!’” She claps between each word. But despite the acclaim for her testimony and eventual victory (she asked for one symbolic dollar), she still felt belittled. It was two months prior to the beginning of the #MeToo movement. “Even this case was literally twisted so hard that people were calling it the ‘butt-grab case’. They were saying I sued him because there’s this narrative that I want to sue everyone. That was one of the reasons why the summer was the apocalypse.”She never wanted the assault to be made public. Have there been other instances she has dealt with privately? “Actually, no,” she says soberly. “I’m really lucky that it hadn’t happened to me before. But that was one of the reasons it was so traumatising. I just didn’t know that could happen. It was really brazen, in front of seven people.” She has since had security cameras installed at every meet-and-greet she does, deliberately pointed at her lower half. “If something happens again, we can prove it with video footage from every angle,” she says.The allegations about Harvey Weinstein came out soon after she won her case. The film producer had asked her to write a song for the romantic comedy One Chance, which earned her second Golden Globe nomination. Weinstein also got her a supporting role in the 2014 sci-fi movie The Giver, and attended the launch party for 1989. But she says they were never alone together.“He’d call my management and be like, ‘Does she have a song for this film?’ And I’d be like, ‘Here it is,’” she says dispassionately. “And then I’d be at the Golden Globes. I absolutely never hung out. And I would get a vibe – I would never vouch for him. I believe women who come forward, I believe victims who come forward, I believe men who come forward.” Swift inhales, flustered. She says Weinstein never propositioned her. “If you listen to the stories, he picked people who were vulnerable, in his opinion. It seemed like it was a power thing. So, to me, that doesn’t say anything – that I wasn’t in that situation.”Meanwhile, Donald Trump was more than nine months into his presidency, and still Swift had not taken a position. But the idea that a pop star could ever have impeded his path to the White House seemed increasingly naive. In hindsight, the demand that Swift speak up looks less about politics and more about her identity (white, rich, powerful) and a moralistic need for her to redeem herself – as if nobody else had ever acted on a vindictive instinct, or blundered publicly.But she resisted what might have been an easy return to public favour. Although Reputation contained softer love songs, it was better known for its brittle, vengeful side (see This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things). She describes that side of the album now as a “bit of a persona”, and its hip-hop-influenced production as “a complete defence mechanism”. Personally, I thought she had never been more relatable, trashing the contract of pious relatability that traps young women in the public eye.It was the assault trial, and watching the rights of LGBTQ friends be eroded, that finally politicised her, Swift says. “The things that happen to you in your life are what develop your political opinions. I was living in this Obama eight-year paradise of, you go, you cast your vote, the person you vote for wins, everyone’s happy!” she says. “This whole thing, the last three, four years, it completely blindsided a lot of us, me included.”She recently said she was “dismayed” when a friend pointed out that her position on gay rights wasn’t obvious (what if she had a gay son, he asked), hence this summer’s course correction with the single You Need To Calm Down (“You’re comin’ at my friends like a missileWhy are you mad?When you could be GLAAD?”). Didn’t she feel equally dismayed that her politics weren’t clear? “I did,” she insists, “and I hate to admit this, but I felt that I wasn’t educated enough on it. Because I hadn’t actively tried to learn about politics in a way that I felt was necessary for me, making statements that go out to hundreds of millions of people.”She explains her inner conflict. “I come from country music. The number one thing they absolutely drill into you as a country artist, and you can ask any other country artist this, is ‘Don’t be like the Dixie Chicks!’” In 2003, the Texan country trio denounced the Iraq war, saying they were “ashamed” to share a home state with George W Bush. There was a boycott, and an event where a bulldozer crushed their CDs. “I watched country music snuff that candle out. The most amazing group we had, just because they talked about politics. And they were getting death threats. They were made such an example that basically every country artist that came after that, every label tells you, ‘Just do not get involved, no matter what.’“And then, you know, if there was a time for me to get involved…” Swift pauses. “The worst part of the timing of what happened in 2016 was I felt completely voiceless. I just felt like, oh God, who would want me? Honestly.” She would otherwise have endorsed Hillary Clinton? “Of course,” she says sincerely. “I just felt completely, ugh, just useless. And maybe even like a hindrance.”I suggest that, thinking selfishly, her coming out for Clinton might have made people like her. “I wasn’t thinking like that,” she stresses. “I was just trying to protect my mental health – not read the news very much, go cast my vote, tell people to vote. I just knew what I could handle and I knew what I couldn’t. I was literally about to break. For a while.” Did she seek therapy? “That stuff I just really wanna keep personal, if that’s OK,” she says.She resists blaming anyone else for her political silence. Her emergence as a Democrat came after she left Big Machine, the label she signed to at 15. (They are now at loggerheads after label head Scott Borchetta sold the company, and the rights to Swift’s first six albums, to Kanye West’s manager, Scooter Braun.) Had Borchetta ever advised her against speaking out? She exhales. “It was just me and my life, and also doing a lot of self-reflection about how I did feel really remorseful for not saying anything. I wanted to try and help in any way that I could, the next time I got a chance. I didn’t help, I didn’t feel capable of it – and as soon as I can, I’m going to.”Swift was once known for throwing extravagant 4 July parties at her Rhode Island mansion. The Instagram posts from these star-studded events – at which guests wore matching stars-and-stripes bikinis and onesies – probably supported a significant chunk of the celebrity news industry GDP. But in 2017, they stopped. “The horror!” wrote Cosmopolitan, citing “reasons that remain a mystery” for their disappearance. It wasn’t “squad” strife or the unavailability of matching cozzies that brought the parties to an end, but Swift’s disillusionment with her country, she says.There is a smart song about this on the new album – the track that should have been the first single, instead of the cartoonish ME!. Miss Americana And The Heartbreak Prince is a forlorn, gothic ballad in the vein of Lana Del Rey that uses high-school imagery to dismantle American nationalism: “The whole school is rolling fake diceYou play stupid gamesYou win stupid prizes,” she sings with disdain. “Boys will be boys thenWhere are the wise men?”As an ambitious 11-year-old, she worked out that singing the national anthem at sports games was the quickest way to get in front of a large audience. When did she start feeling conflicted about what America stands for? She gives another emphatic ugh. “It was the fact that all the dirtiest tricks in the book were used and it worked,” she says. “The thing I can’t get over right now is gaslighting the American public into being like” – she adopts a sanctimonious tone – “‘If you hate the president, you hate America.’ We’re a democracy – at least, we’re supposed to be – where you’re allowed to disagree, dissent, debate.” She doesn’t use Trump’s name. “I really think that he thinks this is an autocracy.”As we speak, Tennessee lawmakers are trying to impose a near-total ban on abortion. Swift has staunchly defended her “Tennessee values” in recent months. What’s her position? “I mean, obviously, I’m pro-choice, and I just can’t believe this is happening,” she says. She looks close to tears. “I can’t believe we’re here. It’s really shocking and awful. And I just wanna do everything I can for 2020. I wanna figure out exactly how I can help, what are the most effective ways to help. ’Cause this is just…” She sighs again. “This is not it.”It is easy to forget that the point of all this is that a teenage Taylor Swift wanted to write love songs. Nemeses and negativity are now so entrenched in her public persona that it’s hard to know how she can get back to that, though she seems to want to. At the end of Daylight, the new album’s dreamy final song, there’s a spoken-word section: “I want to be defined by the things that I love,” she says as the music fades. “Not the things that I hate, not the things I’m afraid of, the things that haunt me in the middle of the night.” As well as the songs written for Alwyn, there is one for her mother, who recently experienced a cancer relapse: “You make the best of a bad dealI just pretend it isn’t real,” Swift sings, backed by the Dixie Chicks.How does writing about her personal life work if she’s setting clearer boundaries? “It actually made me feel more free,” she says. “I’ve always had this habit of never really going into detail about exactly what situation inspired what thing, but even more so now.” This is only half true: in the past, Swift wasn’t shy of a level of detail that invited fans to figure out specific truths about her relationships. And when I tell her that Lover feels a more emotionally guarded album, she bristles. “I know the difference between making art and living your life like a reality star,” she says. “And then even if it’s hard for other people to grasp, my definition is really clear.”Even so, Swift begins Lover by addressing an adversary, opening with a song called I Forgot That You Existed (“it isn’t love, it isn’t hate, it’s just indifference”), presumably aimed at Kanye West, a track that slightly defeats its premise by existing. But it sweeps aside old dramas to confront Swift’s real nemesis, herself. “I never grew upIt’s getting so old,” she laments on The Archer. She has had to learn not to pre-empt disaster, nor to run from it. Her life has been defined by relationships, friendships and business relationships that started and ended very publicly (though she and Perry are friends again). At the same time, the rules around celebrity engagement have evolved beyond recognition in her 15 years of fame. Rather than trying to adapt to them, she’s now asking herself: “How do you learn to maintain? How do you learn not to have these phantom disasters in your head that you play out, and how do you stop yourself from sabotage – because the panic mechanism in your brain is telling you that something must go wrong.” For her, this is what growing up is. “You can’t just make cut-and-dry decisions in life. A lot of things are a negotiation and a grey area and a dance of how to figure it out.”And so this time, Swift is sticking around. In December she will turn 30, marking the point after which more than half her life will have been lived in public. She’ll start her new decade with a stronger self-preservationist streak, and a looser grip (as well as a cameo in Cats). “You can’t micromanage life, it turns out,” she says, drily.When Swift finally answered my question about the moment she would choose in the VH1 Behind The Music episode about herself, the one where her career turned, she said she hoped it wouldn’t focus on her “apocalypse” summer of 2016. “Maybe this is wishful thinking,” she said, “but I’d like to think it would be in a couple of years.” It’s funny to hear her hope that the worst is still to come while sitting in her fairytale living room, the cats pacing: a pragmatist at odds with her romantic monument to teenage dreams.

We need a foreign policy based on long-term UK interests and a strong economy, and that requires close relationships with our European neighbours.“No deal represents the biggest unilateral abandonment of those interests in modern British history. It should not be allowed to happen. We hope the prime minister uses this G7 meeting to signal a different approach.”The intervention came after the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, confirmed the UK would not nominate a new candidate for the role of EU commissioner, as other members states in the bloc considered who to nominate. He said: “We are leaving the EU on 31 October. As a departing member state we will not be involved in the new commission so it would be a distraction to nominate a new commissioner.”On Friday, the prime minister played down hopes of an early breakthrough in talks with the EU over the Brexit deal.Johnson told reporters during a visit to Devon: “I’m afraid we will have to prepare to come out without an agreement and we can do that. We are very confident that we will be OK because we will have all sorts of preparations in place.“We are making progress but I am just telling people not to hold their breath, because I have seen the way these Brussels negotiations work.“I must urge people – we are going to be working very hard on this but they shouldn’t necessarily get their hopes up too soon.”Later, in remarks released before the G7 summit, Johnson said the UK would continue to be an “energetic partner” to its international allies after Brexit.“The Britain I lead will be an international, outward-looking, self-confident nation,” he said. “We will be an energetic partner on the world stage. We will stand alongside our G7 allies to solve the most pressing international issues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d29d0f56568c4a80e046e785e67baa5e2ea4dd5/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b98c76f797762fe517bb8d1ceaf97af","title":"hrt shortage uk women","story":"Doctors say HRT is becoming difficult to prescribe because of supply crisisMedical experts are calling for action to resolve the national shortage of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products used to treat menopausal symptoms.The shortage is causing difficulties for thousands of women in the UK, medical experts have said.In a joint statement, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), the British Menopause Society (BMS) and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) said they were receiving multiple queries from women unable to get HRT products.About half of the most commonly prescribed HRT products, which replace hormones, including oestrogen, that naturally decline during the menopause, are out of stock. The high street pharmacies Boots and Lloyds are among those said to be experiencing shortages.Doctors were also reporting that HRT was becoming difficult to prescribe because of the shortages.Prof Lesley Regan, the president of the RCOG, said: “We are very concerned that thousands of women are struggling to get their HRT prescriptions, or even prescriptions for alternative treatments. HRT is essential for many women to ensure that they are able to continue to lead a high-quality life.”The crisis reportedly started in late 2018 when supply issues that began in China forced some manufacturers to stop producing HRT patches. This resulted in increased demand for other brands, which in turn became scarce.Shortages are expected to continue until next year.Haitham Hamoda, a consultant gynaecologist and chair of the BMS, said women experiencing difficulties needed to be offered support and advice on how to get supplies of their HRT medications.“The British Menopause Society has advised prescribers to find equivalent types by looking at the oestrogen and progestogen component and matching it as closely as possible to another brand,” he said.“Beyond this, we need to understand the reasons behind this and what measures could be taken to resolve this issue and to prevent it happening again in the future.”Dr Asha Kasliwal, the president of the FSRH, said she was treating women every week who had been affected by the shortage. “These women are not being able to receive the treatment that best suits their needs, leaving some women to cope with quite debilitating symptoms that directly impact on their daily lives,” she said.“It is important that the Department of Health and Social Care continues to work with suppliers of HRT medicines. We need to ensure that women are not disadvantaged further because of the shortage, and that they access HRT treatment when they need it.”The DHSC said it was aware of the ongoing supply issues. A spokesperson said: “We are working closely with all suppliers to maintain overall flow of medicines to patients.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Only a slight one, however, given how Djokovic has developed the knack of raising his game in the biggest moments this year, as he demonstrated by saving two championship points before outlasting Roger Federer in the longest Wimbledon final of all time last month. He heads to Flushing Meadows as the undisputed favourite.Another chance for the Spaniard to close in on Federer’s record of 20 grand slam titles. He won his 18th major at the French Open in June but he was left licking his wounds after being outplayed by Federer in their Wimbledon semi-final. It was a tough one for Nadal to take but he has impressed since then, crushing Medvedev in the final of the Canadian Open earlier this month. Having won this tournament three times, the world No 2 still looks too strong for the players below the elite.The Swiss must have spent the past few weeks wondering how he let it slip away against Djokovic at Wimbledon. He was the superior player for most of the match and had two championship points on his serve but he tightened up in the defining moments and paid the price. It was one of the worst defeats of his career and the fear for Federer, who has not won the US Open since 2008, must be that he cannot take Djokovic over five sets.The world No 4 remains in a search for consistency on surfaces away from clay. Following up a run to the French Open final with a first-round defeat at Wimbledon was a blow and Thiem’s results have been mixed since SW19. Losing to Medvedev in the last eight of the Canadian Open was more instructive than dominating a modest field at the Austrian Open and there are doubts over Thiem’s fitness after a virus forced him to pull out of his match against Richard Gasquet in Cincinnati.Another grand slam, another hopeful wait for a member of the Next Gen to challenge the big three. Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas both fell well short at Wimbledon, while Felix Auger-Aliassime needs more matches at the highest level, and there is no point investing much hope in Nick Kyrgios. But perhaps Medvedev can step up after stunning Djokovic in Cincinnati.

Do it, Tim.“Coming home from a walk we wandered past Cawthorne Cricket Club in South Yorkshire where we sat and watched a very entertaining half hour,” says Diana Powell. “Why not send a bus down the M1?”It’ll need to be a bus given there are no trains back to London today - or something like that. A good freelancer, I’ll be blagging a ride.13th over: England 31-2 (Root 5, Denly 11) Ohhh, Cummins is the proverbial coat of varnish away from Australia’s third, carving back through Denly - so close to both his inside edge and bails. Earlier, he picked up four off the edge, squared up a treat. Denly is into double figures again! The only England player to achieve that in this match. “I am doing the night shift,” begins a nice email from Ramal Zanji, “feeding my young twins (who are now asleep on the couch either side of me) whilst watching the game with the sound largely muted and your commentary my ‘wireless’. Tired enough with the demands presented by the young ones, this strange yet mesmerising Ashes series has given me a rather raggedy appearance. As a refugee migrant to a small Australian country town as a young child, I quickly learned that sporting pursuits are largely tied to acceptance and became a pretty handy all rounder. It was Freddy Flintoff’s compassion toward Brett Lee in *that* Ashes series that made me a passionate fan of the game.If this Test somehow ends up as a draw, do you think that England would be happy to extend a Visa and a spot in the team to an Australian from Afghanistan with an Indian mother and Persian father? It wouldn’t be all that unusual really given the past few decades.”12th over: England 27-2 (Root 5, Denly 7) Hazlewood is angling in at Root, who plays out a maiden. What he would give for a long, meaningful stay at the crease over the next four or more hours.“You’ll know the answer to this,” insists Pete Salmon. Let’s hope so. “Has it ever happened before that in six innings in a row a team’s top score has always been made in the same position? And that the position is number 4? And by two different batsmen, with three innings each? Where the second batsman replaced the first half way through the six innings? Has it?” I definitely do not know that. But Andrew Samson might be able to work it out for me. I’ll hit him up at the tea break. 11th over: England 27-2 (Root 5, Denly 7) It ends up quite a long delay, Denly defending the two full balls that complete the over.“I know it’s been said before,” emails Romeo, “but for the best seats in the whole ground, at the rugby end, to be empty is more shameful than England’s battting.” From my vantage point, they look to all be on the second level in front of the glass rooms where the luncheshospitality are on. I’ve been guilty of going to those events and never leaving the room.Cummins hits Denly. An Archer-esque bouncer follows him and he’s hit right on the front of the helmet. For the third time today we go through the formal process, now with the England team doctor. In keeping with the practice, he’s given a replacement lid. Play on.10th over: England 26-2 (Root 4, Denly 7) Hazlewood is attacking Root’s stumps, the captain getting his blade down in time to get a single behind square. Denly gets under another bumper then flashes at the fuller ball that follows. This is tough going. Can he survive?9th over: England 25-2 (Root 3, Denly 7) Cummins is hitting the radar up towards 90mph, beating Denly to begin with a ball that hits the seam and changes direction a treat. He’s beaten again from the third ball. This has been an outstanding spell. Denly gets under a short one then defends with a straight bat to finish. Hanging in there. “England all-out 212,” predicts Leo Harvey. “But I still see in my befuddled England cricket fan mind Buttler hitting the winning runs. I’m in Hong Kong, must be the jetlag.” Suspect so. They aren’t reaching 200 here. My guess: they’re done here by 5pm. 8th over: England 25-2 (Root 3, Denly 7) Huge appeal! Hazlewood thinks he has Root for nothing but the noise he hears is bat hitting pad not ball. Paine wisely declines to review. Andrew Samson reveals on radio that only two England skippers - Botham and Hussain - have bagged an Ashes pair. Root won’t join them though, stroking three off the back out behind point to get off the mark. Denly gets three himself to finish, driving nicely down the ground. “Game on!” says Geoff Wignall of the Kent veteran’s arrival in the middle at No4. “Now that there’s an England batter out there with the proven ability to reach double figures.”7th over: England 19-2 (Root 0, Denly 4) Denly off the mark through the cordon! It was the pleave at its best, the ball hitting his bat after he withdrew it. A fast bouncer follows, but he gets out of the way. Just. Tremendous bowling.“That was a serious ball,” Alastair Cook says of the Roy dismissal. “I don’t think many people are going to be hitting that one.”Phwooooar! Pat Cummins is through Roy’s defence! Beaten on the outside edge at pace, it crashes into his off-stump. It angled in a treat the opener’s feet were nowhere. This could be over before tea.Rinse and repeat! Hazlewood pitched this on the stumps but Burns had ample time to get his bat out of the way. Instead, he offered the blade with the ball clipping the shoulder of it on the way through to David Warner at first slip. Root, once again, is walking out too early.5th over: England 13-0 (Burns 5, Roy 8) Cummins cuts Roy in half! There’s a huge shout for caught behind but they elect not to send it upstairs. Good decision, based on the first replay. Roy does nicely to wait on the delivery that follows, clipping a couple. The crowd are right behind the hosts here, roaring for every run. I can’t quite tell yet if they are serious or taking the you know what? Ooooh, I take back the generous words about the opening batsman: he wafts at the final ball of the over, well outside the off-stump. There’s nothing to be gained playing at those, Jason. Not now. Nothing at all.It will be Cummins to Roy. We’re back. PLAY! “England need more than five times as many in the 4th innings as they got in the second,” notes Jim Hart. “Anyone know what the record is in a winning 4th innings chase?” That would be, if I recall correctly, the West Indies at the Rec in 2003 vs Australia. They successfully made 418 in that chase. Oh, that snuck up on me... the players are back on the field! Some emails before we return. “England,” begins Peter Piper. “Crap!” There are a lot like this, funnily enough. “Some lunchtime thoughts for the England batsmen,” begins Kim Thonger, “adapting Søren Kierkegaard by replacing ‘life’ with ‘batting’. Batting can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards. Batting is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced. Especially poignant since he wrote ‘Fear \u0026amp Trembling’ and The Concept Of Anxiety.”Off to join the lunch queue. Back in about 20 minutes. If you’re looking for something to keep you company, Geoff and I interviewed James Pattinson after the Birmingham Test. He’s a fantastic fella. 4th over: England 11-0 (Burns 5, Roy 6) In an effort to maybe get another from Cummins before the break, it is Lyon on to replace Hazlewood with three minutes on the clock. They tried him briefly at Burns yesterday, but he got out too quickly - hooking Cummins - which denied the spinner a proper spell. The left-hander pushes the first, a full toss, for a couple to midwicket. There are two men around the bat on the off side and Burns splits the two of them on the front foot - solid batting. He then cuts one to deep point, leaving Roy one to keep out with less than a minute to 1pm. He takes guard, killing enough time to make this the final ball of the session. He gets on the front foot, driving one to long-on to finish. The crowd give it big as they leave the field, thrilled that England have made it to the end of the fourth over without losing a wicket. Very good. 3rd over: England 7-0 (Burns 2, Roy 5) Hard hands! Roy pushes at Cummins rather than letting the ball come to him, the result a leading edge that so easily could have ended up with a catcher. Instead, it spits away past point for four, running across the square. “Have England gone to the well once too often with Stokes?” asks Niall Morrissey. “He’s sort of key to the batting. He has had a very physical match so far, with little chance to rest up. If England are to have any chance here, the early order has to front up and grind away while he recovers.” Very surprised he was bowled like that. We know from the sports science types how carefully ‘loads’ are managed spell to spell.2nd over: England 3-0 (Burns 2, Roy 1) Roy is off the mark second ball with careful clip through square leg. Hazlewood’s turn at Burns but there isn’t a lot going on, the opener dealing with it tidily. Some news from the Australian camp, confirming that Steve Smith did bat for 15 minutes today, facing throw downs. “He will continue to be assessed with a view to playing the tour match in Derby.”1st over: England 2-0 (Burns 2, Roy 0) Good from Burns, keeping his cool and grabbing a single from the single from the final delivery of the over, turning Cummins around the corner. Due to the blow, that should mean we get four overs in before the break rather than five. Speaking of openers. “With Lancashire letting Haseeb Hameed go and Trescothic retiring, should Somerset give him a go?” asks Vic Voronins. I doubt it will be that straightforward. But I did see Hameed’s ton at Lord’s this year. Let’s hope he finds a way through.Cummins hits Burns! Second ball, he’s got a delivery to jump off a length at the handle of the bat. Burns cops the whack rather than taking his hand off the blade. There’s a bit of blood from his left thumb. It wasn’t far from the man at short leg, either. After some attention from the medical staff, it looks like he will continue. The players are back. Cummins to Burns from the Kirkstall Lane End. Can England get to lunch unscathed? Let’s find out. PLAY! Australia should get five overs in before lunch. A few emails before we come to that. “Time to get the tin hats on,” says David Seare. “What will you do with your two spare days? Maybe you could offer cricket insight on street corners as a kind of ‘crusker’” Good vibes for a fourth day, yeah? Freelancer here.“Labuschagne is a common Afrikaans surname (Marnus is from an Afrikaans family in South Africa),” notes Louwrens Botha. “The ‘ch’ is pronounced as a hard ‘k’ and the ‘g’ is pronounced like the Scottish ‘ch’. Have fun with that one. So it’s sort of ‘lah-buh-ska(ch)-knee’, not like Champagne (or indeed Charlemagne).”Handy, thanks. I should not that in the UAE last year he specifically asked us to address him as Labu-shane. For what it’s worth.“We are all hoping England can survive until tea and so a little bit of thinking outside the box to confuse the Aussies,” suggests Harshad Mistry. “We are going to be all out so at least let’s try a new tactic. Let’s reverse the batting order and open with Leach and Broad. Our lower has perfomed better than the top order. We have nothing to lose except losing so let’s lose in a different way.”Well, it was good enough for Bradman!“Afternoon Adam.” Hi, David Horn. “Presumably, for maximum effect, England will close today on 203-4. Thereby allowing for the proper, overnight, brewing of hope, before being scuttled for 240 tomorrow morning.” Ala Adelaide in 2017. Lovely morning, that. Then Hazlewood decided to knock Root over with the first ball and that was that. Fun! So, 75 runs added this morning. That’s a win for the visitors. Stokes finishes with 346 from his 24 unchanged overs from the Football Stand End, Archer and Broad picking up two apiece. Lyon chops on! Archer finishes the job. England are set 359 to win.75th over: Australia 246-9 (Lyon 9, Hazlewood 4) Whoa, Woakes has missed the bouncing ball on the fine leg rope! Should have been one, it is four instead. Stokes does close to finishing Hazlewood off with the yorker later in the over, but can’t quite get under his blade. “So it’s November 2021: the start of the next Ashes series,” emails Paul Griffin. “I’m trying to think of the England selection. Time will have taken Jimmy and probably Broad from the bowling attack. So it’s Jofra and Stokes plus two - unless England have Michael Owen-ed the former to the knackers yard by then. I’ve no idea who will open Root at 4, unless this series destroys him? Buttler to be in there somewhere? Any other survivors? It’s a long way back from this, and we are only just half way through this series in days played.”Always the game to play at the end of a losing Ashes campaign, isn’t it? Australia lead by 358, so that might be a task for the pub tonight. 74th over: Australia 241-9 (Lyon 4, Hazlewood 4) The ball before Labuschagne fell might have influenced his error, only just getting out the way of another bouncer that trailed back at his lid. He was in the middle for 294 minutes - another excellent contribution. Hazlewood gets out the way of a short ball, then clips the yorker away for four! As you do! Glorious shot from the Australian No11. Urgh! They ran on the Denly misfield at third man, recovering well to fire a throw in to Bairstow who made a well-timed lunge. Labuschagne is out by about six inches, the TV umpire confirms.73rd over: Australia 236-8 (Labuschagne 79, Lyon 4) Stokes again. What is going on with Woakes, I wonder? The lead is 348 by the end of the over, Lyon doing it really nicely - pulling a bouncer for two then hacking a couple more through midwicket. Labuschagne’s turn. “Oh my goodness,” says Jason Ali. “Hope has reared its ugly little head. The next 3-4 hours are going to be awful.”False hope, the worst kind. I’m sorry in advance. Pattinson is going to take 731, or something ridiculous. His turn to go big, I reckon.72nd over: Australia 232-8 (Labuschagne 79, Lyon 0) Shot, Marnus! He makes a bit of room and lifts Archer over backward point, splitting the fielders in the deep for four. He takes the single on offer to midwicket from the third ball but gets the strike straight back via a leg bye. A good result, but Lyon will be at the business end next.“I don’t get the problems people profess about pronouncing Labuschagne,” emails John Staruck, “since they presumably know how to say Charlemagne, which is almost an anagram of it.”We’re doing a proper interview with him this week on The Final Word. I’m sure it’ll come up. Actually, let’s crowd-source. What else would you like Geoff and me to ask him about on the show? Come and watch us in Manchester with Jim Maxwell, if that’s your thing.71st over: Australia 226-8 (Labuschagne 74, Lyon 0) Lyon is far from convincing but gets to the end of the over. Will Labuschagne try to take down Archer, mindful that he might not have long left?Stokes gets a third wicket in this tireless spell! His short ball gets big on Cummins, who can only deflect to Burns in the gully.70th over: Australia 226-7 (Labuschagne 74, Cummins 6) They took drinks during the concussion test, which Labuschagne has to pass for the second time this morning. There will be Dr Richard Saw merchandise before the summer is over, he’s spent so much time out in the middle on camera. Another quick and short ball follows, the nuggety Queenslander up to the task lifting over the cordon for four! And again, angled at his chest, just kept out. And again, right on his armpit. Jofra Archer is in the game.“All these negative nellies wondering whether the match will still be running later today,” writes Matt Dony. “Of course it will! At this rate, Australia may as well bat on until just after lunch on Monday, and still be pretty confident of the win.” Freelancers say YES to that.“Is the first question Dr Saw asks Marnus in the Concussion Quiz, ‘How do you pronounce your surname?’” laughs Romeo. I know one of the questions is the name of the Australian Prime Minister, which is quite good value given the chaos in Canberra over recent years.Archer hits Labuschagne again! Very similar to the blow at Lord’s last week, the Queenslander tries to get out of the way but is collected on the bottom rung of the grille. And just like last Sunday, he was straight back onto his feet. Nevertheless, Dr Saw is back on the field to go through the formal process. He looks fine from here. 69th over: Australia 222-7 (Labuschagne 70, Cummins 6) Stokes again from the Football Stand End. He’s now into his 22nd over on the trot, albeit over two days. He keeps charging in, too. Cummins, the new man, is off the mark with a boundary off the all-rounder, from the outside half of his bat behind point along the ground. England at 92 for the win at one betting shop, Boris Starling reports. Normally, I wouldn’t put such a thing into the OBO, but, as he adds - quite rightly: “In the spirit of Headingley Ashes Tests, I’ll only stick a tenner on them once those odds have drifted to 5001.”On other Headingley quirks, this is one of only two grounds where 300-plus has been successfully chased three times in the fourth innings. That’s another via Andrew Samson. 1948, of course, 2001 with Butch and 2017 when Shai Hope completed his twin tons.Nicely bowled, Archer winning Pattinson’s edge with a bit of extra bounce from around the wicket. It’s well taken low to Root’s left at first slip. The end of a handy partnership, worth 51. Australia now lead by 327. That’s 100 Test catches for Root, Andrew Samson says.67th over: Australia 208-6 (Labuschagne 69, Pattinson 19) Alastair Cook is kind about Pattinson’s technique on TMS, “he gets his trigger movement in early.” Of course, he would remember his work from Trent Bridge in 2013. So close. Stokes beats him in defence early in the over, but the left-hander is playing down the line - there’s nothing wrong with that, as Warner proved on Thursday. 66th over: Australia 207-6 (Labuschagne 69, Pattinson 18) Here’s Jofra, who spent some time off the field yesterday with cramp. A single for each early on, as Archer moves through the gears. Oh, now the summer of fives continues! It comes from a third single to midwicket - of the quick variety - earning him four overthows when the ping at the non-strikers’ end isn’t on target. 65th over: Australia 200-6 (Labuschagne 68, Pattinson 12) Shot. Pattinson has a bit of width to work with and uses it well to cut Stokes away for four to move into double figures. A single to square leg to finish the over brings up Australia’s 200. Their lead is 312. “I’m currently at work, will be here until 5,” reports Max Cornell “What are the chances that this match is over before my shift?” On the evidence of the first half an hour, quite high.“Also, hoping someone can explain something to me that I just don’t understand with my limited cricket knowledge (I love the sport but have never really dug deep enough into the ins and outs of it). How do the weather conditions affect the way the ball moves?”Depends who you listen to. Some scientists say that the overhead conditions have absolutely no effect on the swing of a cricket ball. But every fast bowler in the world disagrees with that contention.64th over: Australia 194-6 (Labuschagne 67, Pattinson 7) That is a BAD DROPPED CATCH, Bairstow ing in front of first slip with one glove, putting Labuschagne down. It was going straight to Root. Dear me. That’s ugly cricket. Broad is gutted it shows. Earlier, he was driven through the covers for four. That set up the (should have been) wicket-taking delivery a treat, generating a lovely amount of movement. Sure enough, Labuschagne scores off the next ball, pulling a couple, then finishes with three more off his pads. An expensive and highly-frustrating over for the England spearhead.63rd over: Australia 183-6 (Labuschagne 56, Pattinson 7) Pattinson is looking pretty good so far today, dealing with Stokes from around the wicket without any concerns. Maiden.“I’m no fan of Root as captain,” begins Matt Jones, an England fan in Sydney. Years ago, I knew an English Matt Jones in Sydney. The same guy? “I would much rather see him in the team as a focused batsman. But I do feel he’s not being well served by the pressure to bat at three. When do we get to put an end to the nonsense of ‘your best batsman should go in at first drop’? Look at Australia this series...over a third of their total runs this series have come from whoever they’ve had batting at four (and well over half of their runs that have truly mattered). There’s been minimal contribution from their top three and yet no obvious pressure on Smith or Labuschagne to move up to three. Anyway I’m just clutching at straws to whinge about in the face of yesterday’s batting fiasco.” Michael Vaughan is big on this too, wanting Root back to four right away. Maybe he’ll bat there in the second dig? 62nd over: Australia 183-6 (Labuschagne 56, Pattinson 7) Labuschagne has been hit on the head again. Nothing to worry about it has only clipped his lid when missing a Broad bouncer on the hook shot. But Dr Saw is out there doing yet another concussion test, presumably, and all is well. Four runs came from it, leg byes the signal after being being given as runs initially - corrected by Umpire Wilson. Back to it, Broad beats him with a good’un to finish. That’s the first we’ve seen it hoop this morning. Maybe some reverse?“Loving ‘Rob Smyth later’ in the OBO cast list for the day,” says Simon Yates. “Proper optimism to think England might make it till Rob’s stint.” I thought that too. But maybe these two bat big?61st over: Australia 178-6 (Labuschagne 56, Pattinson 6) Stokes to Labuschagne, who is into a good contest already with the England all-rounder, forced to make good decisions against a couple of sharp and accurate bumpers. I’m mindful of how much pressure Root is under, but I am a bit worried for Stokes’ body. There’s a reason bowlers who touch 90mph don’t bowl unchanged, as he did yesterday for about 15 overs before the close. Some thoughts from Graham O’Reilly. “What I find hard to believe is that Graham Thorpe, one of the most pugnacious and technically adept batsmen of recent times, on whom you could always rely to fight it out in a crisis, is letting his charges play like that. Has he been obliged to buy into the stuff of “go out there and express yourselves” ? Does he give them the rounds of the kitchen when they come back in after another stupid and unnecessary shot ? If not, why not?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2591cf99a7eee0ca05f6729ed1bf3378a53607/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40379b5bfa76ff7418cc784274e4b143","title":"cambridge analytica facebook response internal document","story":"Internal correspondence provides new insight into how Facebook staff reacted to concerns about use of user data by political campaign consultantsInternal Facebook correspondence from September 2015, released as part of a US government lawsuit on Friday, reveals new details about Facebook’s early knowledge of potentially improper data collection by Cambridge Analytica.The existence of the internal discussion was first reported by the  in March 2019. That report marked Facebook’s first acknowledgement that some of its employees were aware of concerns about improper data practices by Cambridge Analytica four months before the ’s 11 December 2015 article exposed them. Facebook’s lack of candor about this earlier knowledge to both investors and the press was one of the subjects of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint that Facebook settled by paying a $100m fine in July. Facebook did not admit or deny the SEC’s allegations as part of its settlement.But the correspondence – which the Washington DC attorney general’s office fought for months to unseal as part of its lawsuit – provides new insight into how Facebook staff reacted, or did not react, to concerns about the use of user data by political campaign consultants.The Observer’s March 2018 report on Cambridge Analytica’s continued use of the data and links to Donald Trump’s campaign erupted into an international scandal, inspiring global outrage over the company’s failure to protect users’ personal data and wiping $134bn off Facebook’s market value as its stock price plunged.The correspondence was initiated on 22 September 2015, when a Facebook staff member requested clarification on Facebook’s policies for political consultancies that were scraping data to match Facebook profiles to the lists of voters that campaigns use, known as voter files. (The names of Facebook employees are redacted.)“We suspect many of these companies are doing similar types of scraping, the largest and most aggressive on the conservative side being Cambridge Analytica … a sketchy (to say the least) data modeling company that has penetrated our market deeply.”The employee requested clarity on Facebook’s policies and an investigation into “what Cambridge specifically is actually doing”, as well as further information about the activities of another political consultancy, NationBuilder.No one appears to have responded for a week, and on 29 September another message was sent reiterating that political clients were submitting “pointed questions … around what is in bounds versus what is out of bounds”. “Many companies seem to be in on the edge – possibly over,” the staffer wrote.This second message prompted a handful of responses with differing opinions on the legitimacy of the data practices. One respondent said the request was being passed to “DevOps for initial review”. Another respondent said that their “hunch” is that the data-scraping was “likely non-compliant” with a number of Facebook’s Platform Policies, but noted that it was difficult to decide without more information about how Cambridge Analytica was tapping into Facebook’s system.One staffer appeared intent on tamping down on expectations that Facebook would expend “resources” to proactively investigate the apps that were extracting data from its users, however.“To set expectations, we can’t certifyapprove apps for compliance, and it’s very likely these companies are not in violation of any of our terms,” the employee wrote. “If we had more resources we could discuss a call with the companies to get a better understanding, but we should only explore that path if we do see red flags.”Facebook had a headcount of 11,996 employees and $15.8bn in cash or cash equivalents as of 30 September 2015, according to financial filings.Discussion on the thread lagged after that message and focused on other political consultancies until 11 December 2015, when the  published its exposé.“Can you expedite the review of Cambridge Analytica or let us know what the next steps are?” an employee wrote on the thread that morning. “Unfortunately, this firm is now a PR issue as this story is on the front page of the  website.”Over the course of the rest of the day, discussion focused on understanding the relationship between GSR, a company formed by Aleksandr Kogan, a former Cambridge University academic, which extracted the data of tens of millions of Facebook users, and Cambridge Analytica, which obtained the data from Kogan and GSR for use in political campaigning.The discussion also revealed a number of additional links between Facebook employees and the academics responsible for the research underpinning Cambridge Analytica’s psychometric targeting.One said that they were “good friends” with Michal Kosinski, an erstwhile colleague of Kogan’s at Cambridge. Kosinski had helped pioneer the use of Facebook data to predict personality traits.“Alex Kogan was my postdoc supervisor at Cambridge, although I left before he founded GSR,” a second employee wrote. “I have a cursory understanding on the basic principles behind GSR’s products and data collection methods, if that helps. Feel free to ask me anything.”(Another of Kogan’s Cambridge postdoc students, Joseph Chancellor, had been hired by Facebook in November 2015, but he does not appear to be referenced in the thread. Chancellor co-founded GSR with Kogan and, according to Kogan, was an equal partner in the enterprise.)A third person pointed out a direct relationship between Facebook and Kogan, writing: “It sounds like Facebook has worked with this ‘Aleksandr Kogan’ on research with the Protect \u0026amp Care team.”  reported on Kogan’s research collaborations with Facebook in 2018.On Friday, Facebook published a blogpost by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, entitled “Document holds the potential for confusion”. The post downplays the importance of the document.“There is no substantively new information in this document and the issues have been previously reported,” Grewal wrote. “In September 2015, a Facebook employee shared unsubstantiated rumors from a competitor of Cambridge Analytica, which claimed that the data analytics company was scraping public data ... An engineer looked into this concern and was not able to find evidence of data scraping. Even if such a report had been confirmed, such incidents would not naturally indicate the scale of the misconduct that Kogan had engaged in.“Cambridge Analytica was a clear lapse for us, which we have worked hard to address. We’ve learned many lessons that will help us become a stronger company going forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home.

We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

Bisected by the River Mersey, they are home to at least 67 species of birds, and the rare Daubenton’s bat. During the second world war, mock housing and factory buildings were built of plywood on Turn Moss as decoys to distract German bombers from nearby factories. The area still sports a historic hedge marking the traditional boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire. It was threatened last year with construction by Gary Neville’s Salford City FC, but a local grassroots campaign successfully fought to keep this green space open to all.• visitmanchesterHelen ColleyThe politicians might not be making much use of it at the moment, but Stormont Estate, home to the Northern Ireland Assembly, is a treat for the rest of us. The play park, brainchild of Mo Mowlam, the late Northern Ireland secretary, has swings with wheelchair access and play elements for children with sensory issues. We picnic or grab a coffee from the lorry parked on site. I often join the Saturday park run or use the outdoor gym. Visitors can tour the parliament buildings free of charge and have lunch in the members’ dining room between noon and 2pm. My reliable go-to place for a more hipster brunch or dinner with wine is the fabulous General Merchants nearby. The park is open from dawn to dusk.•  nidirect.gov.ukRoisin ColemanEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

It was a maternity home during the 1960s and 1970s, and many locals were born there (including me). The house was bequeathed to the people of Dumbarton, but for many years lay in a sad state of disrepair until it was let to a Christian organisation. It runs a tea room on Saturdays (and Thursdays and Fridays in summer). You can walk around the gorgeous grounds or, if you’re feeling more energetic, go up into the Lang Craigs wood for fabulous views. Then relax and enjoy your coffee and cake in the Angel Room watched over by the heavenly frescoes.• visitscotlandCarol Ann RamsayWatchtree Nature Reserve, near Carlisle, offers walks in dense woodland populated with hare and deer, as well as frogs, toads and newts, if you look carefully enough. Sited on a former second world war airfield, it has a number of trails through the woods, as well as smooth track perfect for cycling or skating. It is possible to hire a range of bicycles from Watchtree Wheelers to tour the perimeter, though cyclists aren’t permitted to disturb the peace of the wooded areas. Given that is was once the burial ground for thousands of animals caught up in the foot-and-mouth crisis, its transformation into to a nature reserve, wind farm and disability cycling charity is a serene triumph.• watchtreeJames CartwrightHengistbury Head, just south of Christchurch, is a beautiful, tranquil and constantly changing piece of coastline that has something for everyone. As a newly created dog walker, I can choose from flat grassland tracks that lead to high sand dunes down to the beautiful natural and often deserted beach. Or we can choose to go high on to the head and walk the path through heather and ferns, with views of Christchurch Priory and estuary on one side, and the Dorset coastline on the other. Then, right at the tip, you see Mudeford Spit and its beach huts. There is wildlife and colourful plant life everywhere, and whether it’s sunny or cloudy (it’s always windy!) at the end of a walk you feel better for having been there.• see visithengistburyheadPhilippaBaggeridge Country Park, near Wolverhampton, has always been our family’s favourite place for an afternoon walk. It’s a former colliery with beautiful walks, a play park, a miniature railway, lakes and watercress beds to hop across. It’s often heaving on a warm day, so our best memories are in the drizzle when it’s quiet and we can watch the wildfowl on Bag Pool, or walk to Himley Hall and stop for hot chocolate. You often spot relics of the old mine works and can climb to the toposcope and look across to the old brickworks. A great place to observe all four seasons.• sstaffs.gov.ukColin PearsonBeacon Hill national nature reserve stands above the South Downs in Hampshire. The top of the hill is coated in beech woodland, which provides shady respite from the heat of the summer sun. The chalk downlands are the real attraction though, and you have to be prepared to go slow to appreciate its delights – multitudes of plants, all in flower, just centimetres from each other. The mind boggles at how so many different things can live cheek by jowl. The cherry on the cake isn’t just the song of the skylark, but the clouds of butterflies that erupt with every step. Here I am reminded of Pig-Pen, the character in Charlie Brown, as silver-spotted skipper butterflies surround me in their hundreds.• gov.ukRobFor a slice of serenity in the heart of London, I love Millwall Dock on the Isle of Dogs. Dwarfed by the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, this expanse of open water is the perfect contrast to fast-paced urban life. Whether it’s observing the mischievous birdlife squabbling over possession of the tern raft in the old graving dock, or partaking in a bracing open-water swim from the Docklands Sailing \u0026amp Watersports Centre, or simply watching the sun set over the City of London with an array of dinghies in the foreground, there’s always something to amuse, refresh or inspire. And for those more interested in llamas, goats and donkeys, Mudchute Farm is just a stone’s throw away.Jack StookesSandwell Valley, near West Bromwich, is a one-of-a-kind place full of hidden gems, with surviving bits of real countryside, open pastures and grass meadows. It also has a nice old farm turned into a museum and two large, well-equipped playgrounds. Or you can visit the priory ruins – said to be haunted – with its Saxon stone coffins, surrounded by old dark woods with hidden medieval ponds. More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year. And an old colliery site has been transformed into a wildlife haven by the RSPB on the river Tame. This is all within a 1.5-mile radius surrounded on all sides by urban sprawl. May it remain undeveloped for ever.• sandwell.gov.ukStanleyMy absolute favourite green space is the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden. This small urban community oasis is set back from the madness of busy Hackney on a disused train line. It’s a beautifully layered garden with a magical wooded area, raised beds with vegetables, and beautiful pots full of seasonal flowers. The main reason I come here is for inspiration – I love the creativity, especially across the seasons. I especially love visiting in October: despite the year growing old, it is transformed into a beautiful autumnal space, using the changing plants, hundreds of carved pumpkins, and coppery red crispy leaf garlands. Sitting in the cold, warmed by a hot chocolate, it is just perfect.• dalstongarden.orgKatherine PhippsWilliamson Park in Lancaster is a gem. Jimmy Williamson (Lord Ashton) commissioned its construction from the remains of the city quarry in the 19th century. Most people who have passed Lancaster on the M6 heading north will have seen the Ashton Memorial in the centre of the park, rising above the trees, but step inside and you find lovely walks between mature trees, a regular outdoor theatre, cafe, wildlife park, butterfly house, children’s play areas and – on a clear day – views across Morecambe Bay to the Lakeland Fells. It’s a hidden wonder much worth the detour.• see lancaster.gov.ukKarl LesterLooking for a holiday with a difference?

He set his strange 1890s novel The Well-Beloved on Dorset’s Isle of Portland, which stretches out “like the head of a bird” into the channel. Connected to the mainland by a causeway and long, pebbly Chesil Beach, the “island” is famous for the pale limestone that built Saint Paul’s cathedral. There are still quarries here, and striking stone structures: churches and castles, harbours and prisons.The three of us arrive in Weymouth, a couple of miles north of Portland, from different directions. My mum (using her bus pass) along the coast, my brother by rail from Somerset, and me from Essex (via London). The Waterloo to Weymouth train takes three hours. South Western Railway has a patchy record, but today’s journey, with air-con, window seat, table and power sockets, is a model of civilised travel. The onboard wi-fi comes with free entertainment, from Love Island to Darkest Hour the scenery offers marshy estuaries and miles of brackeny New Forest.We meet at King’s Statue on the seafront. George III, in a blue and ermine cloak, looks anxiously through palm trees towards a replica of his royal bathing machine. Regular buses head from here towards Poole and Axminster along the Jurassic Coast. We take the open-topped 501, which leaves hourly in summer for the red-and-white lighthouse at Portland Bill on the far end of the peninsula.After generous crab sarnies (£10.25) at Portland Bill’s The Lobster Pot café, we set off along the coast path on the hottest day of the year so far. The heat draws lightning-fast lizards out on to the sun-warmed rocks and releases the Mediterranean aroma of wild marjoram and aniseedy fennel into the shimmering air. Three shadeless miles to Church Ope Cove leave us sweaty and we swim off the white rocky beach, cooling down in the clear turquoise water.The ruins of 12th-century Rufus Castle stand on the cliffs above us, near Portland Museum (adult £3.50, child 6-15 £1). Family planning pioneer Marie Stopes founded the museum in 1930. She was friends with Hardy, who based Avice Caro’s house in The Well-Beloved on one of the museum’s thatched stone cottages. The rooms are stuffed with local curios, from mummified cats and puffer fish to stone masons’ tools and a U-boat compass. There’s more in the shady garden – fossilised dinosaur vertebrae, a Roman sarcophagus, the wooden arm of an old windmill…Two of Portland’s most interesting churches are close by: ruined St Andrew’s, its overgrown graves carved with piratical skulls and crossbones, is five minutes’ walk away down a wooded path, where butterflies flicker among the buddleias and clematis. Clifftop Georgian St George’s, 15 minutes in the other direction, has an evocative time-warp interior of box pews and twin pulpits. Nikolaus Pevsner called it Dorset’s most impressive 18th-century church.The sturdy brick hostel overlooks neat houses built for the sailors competing in at the 2012 Olympics. For dinner, we have seafood at the sunset-facing Cove House Inn (mains from £8.50) on Chesil Beach, down the road. We stroll back next morning and follow the coast path to Quiddles for breakfast. This cheerful beachside cafe in a candy-pink-painted former public convenience serves sustaining fry-ups (from £5.50) or veggie-friendly bubble and squeak (£3). This sets us up for the short, steep climb up to Tout Quarry (admission free), half a mile away at the top of the cliff. This labyrinth of hidden carvings and half-emerged stone creatures winds through banks of summer flowers. In one disused pit, Antony Gormley’s carved figure, Still Falling, es headfirst down the cliff.The bus takes us down again to Portland Castle, built by Henry VIII. While the others check out the waterfront, I climb the old Merchant’s Incline, once a railway taking quarried stone down to the harbour. At the top, I walk through the daunting archway of 19th-century Verne Citadel, now HMP The Verne, to visit the Jailhouse cafe (panini from £5.25, jacket potato from £6), which reopened earlier this year. It’s an optimistic place with one of Portland’s best views, over miles of sea and curving breakwaters to the chalk-cut white horse at Osmington.Up to 52 passengers and their dogs can sardine into the old wooden ferry for a boat ride back to Weymouth. The 1930s boat was requisitioned during the second world war to carry soldiers out to the breakwater forts. Now it’s a pleasure boat again and we relax as sea air soothes our sunburned faces.After the wild cliffs and lonely quarries, Weymouth’s screaming fairgrounds and beeping arcades feel more than usually crowded, but there’s still space on the long sandy beach for a last swim. Hardy regularly swam here. In The Dynasts, his closet drama in verse, he has George III telling Pitt the Younger “The bathing is unmatched … The air like liquid life.”We sit by the Victorian kiosk near the Punch and Judy show and drink tea before heading to the station, looking out at the view described by Hardy: white cliffs, a cannon-topped headland and “the crescent-curved expanse of the Bay as a sheet of brilliant translucent green”.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Tracy Ann Oberman tweeting: “Jaw drop. To the floor.”“Speculation builds about how well Olivia Colman will succeed Claire Foy as the Queen in the coming third series of The Crown,” Moore wrote on Monday, in a column which picked up traction on social media throughout the week.“Ms Colman herself has expressed anxiety on this score. There is no doubt that she is one of the best actresses of the age, but I have a doubt, too. She has a distinctly leftwing face. This is hard to describe, but easy to recognise.“It is something to do with looking slightly resentful and ironic at the idea of having to play a public role which satisfies the demands of others. The real live Queen has no such face – allowing almost no difference discernible in public between the role and the person.“I hasten to add that I have no idea what Olivia Colman’s political views are. I just have a hunch, which I hope will be proved wrong.”Colman, who first came to prominence in comedy series Peep Show, won best actress at this year’s Oscars for her performance as Queen Anne in The Favourite.She has replaced Foy to play Queen Elizabeth II during the early 60s to early 80s for series three and four of The Crown, which airs on Netflix in November. Her contemporaries derided the suggestion that she would not succeed in the role.Writer Will Black tweeted: “To be fair though, Charles Moore looks exactly like my perception of a callous, creepy, misogynistic, embittered, out of touch, enraged, impotent and dated Tory hack. He looks like one of those pompous establishment psychopaths John Fortune played brilliantly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0714d4cb14fc8a2bf4163104858a889333cbb142/0_56_4008_2406/master/4008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cefa6de092638bea88df78fbaf1116b","title":"can you really make your flight carbon neutral harry meghan elton john carbon offset","story":"Gope Walker has regularly flown to meet his clients in countries as far apart as Ireland and Argentina. But in 2020 his feet will stay firmly on the ground.Walker, who runs an IT consultancy in Oxford, has pledged to make next year flight free. Instead, he will take advantage of increasingly sophisticated software to hold virtual meetings or will travel within Europe by train. “I just thought, this is something I can do. We should all be asking ‘do I really need to go there?’ From a business point of view, I honestly can’t see why I do,” he said.Next week, Alexandra Jellicoe will return to the UK from a family holiday in Annecy in the French Alps. She and her three children under seven will take the train to Paris, and from there to London before the final leg to her home near Bath.The journey will take about 10 hours, but “trains are very child-friendly, you meet other people and you get to see more,” she said. “And if you’re concerned about the environment, one of the biggest things you can do personally is not fly.”The damage caused to the environment by carbon dioxide emitted from aircraft – and the dilemma facing those who want to reduce their carbon footprint but also want to travel – was highlighted last week by a row over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex using private jets. The couple, who have spoken out about the climate crisis – even publicly saying they will only have two children because of their concerns for the planet – were accused of hypocrisy.Elton John, who invited Harry, Meghan and baby Archie to stay at his home in the south of France, defended booking a 12-seat Cessna, citing the need for security and privacy. But the journey was estimated to have emitted seven times more CO2 per person than a commercial flight.Piling on the Sussexes’ discomfort was the emergence at the end of the week of pictures of his brother, William, disembarking with his wife and children from a low-cost commercial flight from Norwich to Aberdeen. Budget airlines are more carbon efficient per person because their flights tend to be fully booked.John said he ensured the Sussexes’ flight was carbon neutral by making an “appropriate contribution” to Carbon Footprint, a consultancy that helps reduce and offset emissions.The company declined to comment on Harry and Meghan’s trip but told the Observer: “Carbon offsetting is an option for mitigating the effects of carbon impact.”Not everyone agrees. “The term is misleading – it implies you can equalise the emissions and fly carbon neutral,” said Roger Tyers, a research fellow at the University of Southampton. “Basically, you emit carbon today and even the best offset won’t repay that debt for many years, by which time a lot more damage has been done.”According to the UN, offsets “risk giving the dangerous illusion of a ‘fix’ that will allow our billowing emissions to just continue to grow”. While offsetting can be a useful temporary measure, “it is not a silver bullet and the danger is that it can lead to complacency,” said Niklas Hagelberg, a UN climate specialist.The problem is compounded by carbon calculators producing varying data on the amount of CO2 emitted by any particular journey, and by disagreement over the effectiveness of hundreds of schemes – such as reforesting, hydroelectrics and solar energy – into which money is invested.Airlines must report their annual CO2 emissions, and the industry is aiming to halve its carbon footprint by 2050 by reducing emissions elsewhere. With nearly 4.4 billion passengers taking to the air last year and global aviation CO2 emissions at almost 900m tonnes, the challenge is immense.Nevertheless, consumer consciousness is rising, helped by the Extinction Rebellion campaign, the environmental activist Greta Thunberg’s zero-emission boat journey across the Atlantic, and the growing phenomenon of flygskam – the Swedish word for flight-shaming.In the UK – where a third runway is planned for Heathrow despite the airport already being the biggest single source of CO2 emissions in the country – environmental activists are urging people to commit to a flight-free 2020.“We accept air travel is part of society and we’re not saying never fly again. We’re trying to start a conversation about how to reduce our carbon footprint,” said Anna Hughes of Flight Free UK. About 3,000 people have already signed up – including Walker and Jellicoe – and the campaign hopes to enlist 100,000 by the start of next year.“People need to be informed about the carbon impact of their journeys. The problem with carbon offsetting is that there’s no such thing as a carbon-neutral flight however many trees are planted – and it gives people a licence to continue behaving in the same way,” said Hughes.He suggested firstly looking at alternative, more sustainable modes of travel, secondly considering whether you are travelling efficiently (“most calculators suggest flying economy has half the carbon impact of business or first class”), and finally, if you really have to fly, investigate the most effective way to offset.Attitudes were changing, he said. “Look at the car industry – the accelerated demand for electric cars, which manufacturers can’t keep up with – or the plastics debate and how people have changed how they shop. But it’s certainly true that one of the worst things you can do as a carbon-conscious citizen is take a flight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ae072931ccc45a05f26afb7ee29bb2bd234999c/61_0_677_406/master/677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b69576b3fccd9a59f8089049a710354","title":"russia today puts japan on the map where new zealand should be","story":"New channel apologises to New Zealanders for map mix-up that also labelled Papua New Guinea as South KoreaRussian news channel RT has apologised for apparently accidentally labelling New Zealand as “Japan”, and Papua New Guinea as “South Korea” in an embarrassing southern hemisphere mix-up.The mistake came in a segment produced by their US bureau about potential new missile bases in “Japan, South Korea and Australia”.

The caption makes clear that “this video includes a corrected map”.In the segment, titled “Manoeuvring missiles”, correspondent Ashlee Banks explained how the US was looking at potential missile bases in Asia.“Another fight between the US and China is heating up, this time it’s over missiles,” she said. “The US has officially withdrawn from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty and now plans to place weapons across the Asia Pacific.“The US is looking to place missiles in Japan, South Korea and Australia,” she said, even as the graphic showed something else.New Zealand, a country of 4.7 million people, is so often forgotten on maps that Tourism New Zealand launched an entire campaign based on the phenomenon.With Ardern and comedian Rhys Darby, it described it as “the next great conspiracy: New Zealand is disappearing off world maps”.A Reddit thread dedicated to recording incidents where New Zealand is left off global maps has more than 74,000 subscribers – among them the infamous map of the world made entirely out of chicken nuggets, but without New Zealand."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3995638.1566592368!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of children with autism special needs without appropriate school places","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh: ‘I am deeply conscious of the stress and anxiety facing parents and their children as we work to secure more places. It is a priority issue for the department.’ Photograph: Alan Betson Hundreds of children with autism or special needs are without appropriate school places ahead of the start of the new school year, new figures indicate.A total of 384 children are in receipt of home tuition grants, which are provided to children on an interim basis on a number of grounds, including the absence of a place in a recognised school, according to latest Department of Education figures.In addition, special needs campaigners and parents say many more children with complex problems are in inappropriate school placements or pre-school settings that do not meet their assessed needs.This, they say, is due to a shortage of places in special schools, which means many end up in special classes attached to mainstream schools lacking specialised supports.The department said it had invested record sums in special education and the number of special classes in schools had jumped from 548 to 1,459 since 2011. In the Dublin 15 area, where shortages of school places are most acute, the department has issued “statutory notices” which legally oblige six schools to make more school places available.‘Stress and anxiety’“I am deeply conscious of the stress and anxiety facing parents and their children as we work to secure more places. It is a priority issue for the department,” Minister for Education Joe McHugh said.In a statement, the National Council for Special Education – which advises the department – said it was aware only a “small number” of children with special needs in the greater Dublin area were still without school places.However, many campaigners say the scale of shortages is far bigger than is officially acknowledged and that there is a lack of data being gathered on the ground.A parents survey carried out by the autism charity AsIAm earlier this year found more than 300 cases of children who were either without a school place or not attending school regularly.Adam Harris, the charity’s chief executive, said the department’s response at the time was that they were satisfied that sufficient school places existed.‘Crisis’“As we enter a new academic year and there are still a plethora of children unable to attend school, the department and the Minister must take responsibility and address this crisis in a meaningful way,” he said.“It is essential we bear in mind that these children do not simply need school places but ‘suitable’ school places as outlined in psychological assessments and in line with the views and experiences of their parents. This means where an autism class or special school is recommended the department must put this in place – otherwise we will simply see these children fall out of school.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3995318.1566571432!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"not going to school next week our children are slipping through the cracks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBenjamin, Tadhg and Rian have all struggled to secure school placesTadhg Reardon should be starting his first day of school next week. He turns six soon, and all the other children in the neighbourhood have their new school uniforms, school bags and lunchboxes.But Tadhg has no school place. His mother Sharon has applied to more than 20 schools in the north Dublin area over the past year or so. He has been rejected by all of them. Some say they won’t have a place next year either.“It’s heart-breaking,” says his mother, Sharon. “He’s come on so well during pre-school . . . he does so well with structure and routine. He’s a happy boy, loves singing, dancing. If he hears Gangnam Style, he’ll be dancing around the room.“He loves nursery rhymes. Ads from the telly. Funny noises. And Minions – he’s obsessed with them.”Tadhg has autism and a moderate intellectual disability. It requires more specialised schooling to meet his needs.But any special schools within a 30km-40km radius are oversubscribed many times over, while mainstream schools with special classes say they are either full or do not have the resources to meet his needs.Now, his only option for the coming year is a home tuition grant.It will pay for a tutor for four hours a day – which his parents must find – but he will be on his own and isolated from his peers.“This should be such an exciting time of year, but it’s awful,” says Sharon. “Now our big fear is that he’ll regress and lose all the progress he’s made. He’s much more social now. Before, he didn’t acknowledge he even had a little brother. That’s all changed. He can make eye contact.”The most frustrating thing, she says, is the window to make most progress in tackling his condition will close soon and that he will be robbed of meeting his full potential.“All you hear is the importance of early intervention. And now this. You’re stuck in limbo. Everything is made so hard. Everything is a struggle. You need to fight to get an assessment, then a diagnosis, then a school place. Surely it should be the opposite.”Hundreds of children such as Tadhg find themselves excluded from the education system. They are children who have been diagnosed as requiring an appropriate education but cannot find a school place.Many of the State’s 134 special schools are oversubscribed many times over, while hundreds of children are on waiting lists for special classes attached to mainstream schools. Many parents who have managed to secure places in special classes often find the system isn’t able to meet their children’s needs.In some cases, parents have been forced to withdraw their children in the absence of appropriate supports to help their children learn. Some say their children are on reduced timetables or have been advised to seek home tuition instead. Others have either been suspended or expelled from schools that say they cannot cope with behaviour of pupils with complex needs.These children are invisible because they are not recorded in official statistics as being out of the education system. Hundreds of others have been given home tuition grants in the absence of any other alternative, latest figures show.Yet there is primary constitutional right to education. Article 42.2 of the Constitution obliges the State to provide for free primary education for all children – regardless of their level of disability – in as full and as positive a manner as for all other children.Official advice is that early intervention is crucial in helping children with conditions such as autism.But many say their children face a brick wall from the State in trying to access appropriate therapies and the education crucial to maximising their potential. Parents in many cases feel their children are being allowed to slip through the cracks of the system.Yet, the State has been investing record sums in special education. Since 2011, the number of special classes has jumped from 548 to more than 1,500 across the country. The number of special needs assistants has risen from just over 10,000 to almost 16,000. One-fifth of the State’s entire €11 billion education budget now goes on special education.Campaigners accept that supports have increased, but say they are simply not enough to meet demand. “We wouldn’t accept it if there weren’t enough school places for schoolchildren in mainstream schools, yet it seems it is acceptable for children with autism to go without,” says Adam Harris of the autism charity AsIAm.Rian is seven. He loves the Avengers, playing with Lego and climbing. “He’s the joy of our family,” says his mother, Suzanne Voakes. “He’s a typical boy, boisterous, loves hiding and climbing. He loves learning. He’s like a shining diamond.”Last September, two years after starting at his local primary school, he was expelled. He was six.Suzanne says the school did all it could for him but that teaching staff simply weren’t equipped or trained to meet his needs.Rian has autism. He is non-verbal and was initially diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability. He can also get highly anxious and very hyperactive.When he was diagnosed, authorities advised Suzanne that her son needed autism-specific education. While there were no places in autism-specific schools, she was delighted when he was offered a place in an autism class at her local school.Rian was placed in a class of six children with autism, all non-verbal and with complex problems.“There was a teacher and two special-needs assistants (SNAs) . . . but it was clear early on that it wasn’t going to work. It was more of a babysitting service. The school tried its best, but they were struggling and ill-equipped. It wasn’t their fault.”Within six months, she says, he lost his speech. His toileting skills disappeared. Soon his anxiety levels were going through the roof, says Voakes.“He was depressed. He’d lost all skills, he wasn’t sleeping and was getting out of control.”When the family had him reassessed by health authorities, his diagnosis had worsened: he now had a moderate instead of mild learning disability. She ended up giving up her job as an intellectual disability nurse. Last September it came to a head.“We realised the school couldn’t meet his needs. He was being excluded on the basis that they couldn’t meet his needs or educate him.“He was expelled. It was something I was in agreement with. There was no other option.”As a result of vigorous campaigning and relentless lobbying, Suzanne has recently been told that her son will finally get a place in an autism-specific service where staff are highly trained, backed up with supports.“This has taken years of constant battling. You end up screaming and shouting and going to war. If I didn’t, Rian would be left on home tuition. This is doing huge damage to families. There is stress and anxiety. My eldest son, he’s 14 I’ve barely had a chance to speak to him properly in months.”Rian’s story shows that even where places in special classes are available, schools are limited by their level of resources and training.There is no obligation, for example, to ensure a teacher in an autism class has a specific qualification in special education. And the only mandatory qualification for a special-needs assistant is the Junior Cert.There is little recognition of autism-specific education in teacher education. Many teachers end up training in their own time or at their own expense.It is not the fault of teachers or schools that they are often ill-equipped to meet the often complex needs of children with special needs, says Síle Parsons, spokeswoman for the ASD 15 group.“You hear of some teachers saying: ‘I’ve done my time in the special unit and I’m not going back.’ It’s seen as a difficult work. But teachers have to be trained and they have to be interested, Otherwise, it doesn’t work,” she says.She says that while the State has made progress in the “bricks and mortar” side of setting up new classes, the lack of training for staff has been a crucial jigsaw piece. It is clear there is difficulty with planning and ensuring there are sufficient places to meet demand.The proportion of children with special needs is rising due, experts say, to a combination of greater awareness and better diagnosis.There are parts of the country where, parents say, the shortage of places is at crisis point.While the Taoiseach has intervened due to a major shortfall of places in the Dublin 15 area – part of his constituency – groups in the capital say there are acute shortages, as well as in areas such as Cork, Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny among others.It is a sign, say many, that the State is still playing catch-up.As recently as the 1990s, the Department of Education’s policy was that intellectually disabled children were “ineducable”. This emerged in a High Court action by Cork mother Marie O’Donoghue, on behalf of her disabled son Paul.While other countries have been providing this education for years, the absence of any meaningful State policy meant vulnerable children were, in effect, left on a scrapheap.A series of landmark cases by parents such as O’Donoghue and Kathy Sinnott helped prompt large-scale investment and new legislation.The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act (2004), or Epsen Act, provided that children with special educational needs would be educated in an inclusive environment.While the Department of Education’s policy is to ensure children with special needs are placed in mainstream classes with supports, there are other options for children with more severe levels of disability. They include autism classes in mainstream schools – where there are usually six pupils to one teacher – or special schools, which specialise in supporting children with more complex needs.While this has changed the face of Irish education, many children are still falling through the cracks of the system.Benjamin Tynan finished sixth class at Scoil na Mainistreach in Celbridge, Co Kildare, earlier this summer. This coming week his classmates are due to start secondary school – but his mother has been told there is no appropriate school place available.The 12-year-old, who has autism and ADHD, finds it difficult to cope with the noise of the classroom and being around other children for long periods.But his mother says he has made great strides in the special autism class at the school. It has given him a sense of belonging, while his teacher has been “wonderful”. He needs a similar special class at second level but has been told there is nothing available.It feels, she says, as is the system has suddenly abandoned him. “Benjamin has a right to go to school, and I want him to be the best he can be. So far, every door has been slammed in our face,” she says.Her worry now is that he will lose much of the progress he has made. As a last resort, she has set up a petition to get a school place for him which has gone on to collect thousands of signatures. But as of now, there is no appropriate school place for him.If battles facing parents at primary level are daunting, many warn an even bigger one looms over the right to education at second level.While there are more than 1,500 special classes at primary level for pupils with autism or other difficulties, there is just a fraction on this in the post-primary sector. So pupils such as Benjamin, who have made great progress at primary level, can end up metaphorically falling off a cliff when they progress to secondary school.Campaigners say there is a chronic lack of data collection and forward planning to meet the needs of children with complex needs.But parents in campaign groups right across the capital – areas such as Dublin 4, 6, 6W, 11 and 12 – as well as many other parts of the country, say they have huge difficulties finding appropriate school places.They say it is hidden by the fact that parents are willing to commute long distances, or even move house, to secure a school place. Home tuition, some say, also takes the pressure off authorities as it means children – statistically, at least – are in receipt of an education.In the case of the Dublin 15 area – where shortages of school have been flagged for a number of years – action on the ground has been late in the day.While parents warned that more than 90 children lacked school places, the Minister for Education was eventually forced to use new powers at the end of June to compel schools in the area to open additional special classes.The letters to the schools concerned arrived on the last day of the summer term, resulting in a scramble to try to open special classes in time for the start of the new school year. Authorities are also rushing to set up a new special school this year for children with more complex needs.In many respects, children in the area are fortunate there is an active and organised group of parents and it is also in the heart of the Taoiseach’s constituency. Political pressure has been brought to bear on solving these issues.By what about hundreds of other children across the State without appropriate school places?When the autism charity AsIAm recently polled more than 300 families who were either waiting for school places or had been excluded from schools, it found more than half of children had not been attending school for anywhere from a few months to three years or more.Only a minority of these families – about 15 per cent – were in receipt of home tuition.Some 90 per cent said they had no contact from Tusla, the child and family agency, which is responsible for ensuring children attend school.Harris says the scale of the problem is a national scandal. “These children are invisible and don’t show up in statistics. It is happening under our noses and the State is pretending that it isn’t,” he said.He calls on Minister for Education Joe McHugh to seek urgent policy advice from the National Council for Special Education on the issue of school exclusion.For many parents, meanwhile, there is heartbreak and frustration. Comerford says parents are consumed with stress and worry over their children’s futures.“When children start school it’s usually an exciting and proud time for families watching their children start a new chapter in their lives,” she says.“But for many parents of children who require access to special schools and ASD classes, their lives are on hold and their rights are being denied. Would we accept this for any other group of schoolchildren?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3996504.1566642253!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"weekend temperatures to reach 25 degrees in some areas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAmy Cooke and Casey O’Driscoll from Kildare enjoying the warm sunshine before the end of the summer break, at Dublins St Stephen’s Green on Friday. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The sun is set to shine this weekend before a return to school for most children next week.Like Friday, Saturday will be warm, particularly in the eastern half of the country where it will reach 20 to 25 degrees, with light breezes. It will be similarly warm in the midlands but cloudier further west with outbreaks of rain in west Munster and parts of Connacht and Ulster, says Met Éireann. In the west, the highest temperatures will reach 17 to 19 degrees.Sunday will be warm and mainly dry thought it will start off cloudy. It will brighten up with some sunny spells and a few showers may develop. Temperatures will reach 24 or 25 degrees in the east and northeast with light breezes while the west will see highs of 18 degrees. The positive weather forecast has triggered a Ultraviolet radiation (UV) warning from the Health Service Executive.UV radiation is the main risk factor responsible for skin cancers and getting too much sun can be harmful whatever the age, the HSE said. In Ireland, the UV index is usually three or above from April to September, even when it is cloudy. The higher the UV index the greater the risk of skin damage and at three or above skin needs to be protected as much as possible, the statement said.Prof Anne Marie Tobin, consultant dermatologist at Tallaght University Hospital, said over 11,000 people are diagnosed with skin cancer in Ireland each year. “This figure is expected to over double by 2045. Thankfully, most skin cancers are preventable by protecting your skin from UV radiation. So our advice is to enjoy the good weather, but take the necessary precautions for you and your family and avoid over-exposure.”A UV Index tool provided on Met Éireann’s website indicates the level of sun protection required on any given day. Evelyn Cusack, head of forecasting at Met Éireann said the Global Solar UV index is a scale developed by the World Health Organisation, which measures the UV radiation level at the surface of the Earth, and gives an indication of the potential for skin damage. “Every day you can check if the UV Index in Ireland is low, moderate, high, very high, or extreme, and we also include advice for the level of sun protection required on any given day. Most important to note is that the peak burn times are between 11am and 2pm,” she said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute alerted at 3am to report of injured man (21) lying on the ground in the townE-cigarettes generally thought safer than cigarettes but long-term effects unknown\u0026lsquoIt would be my plea5ure to have you and your wife 5tay a5 our gue5t5 in the Man5ion Hou5e\u0026rsquoWarm continental air raises temperatures as HSE issues UV radiation warningScientist overseeing HSE fight against CPE warned about declaring emergency overSurvey shows families keeping older relatives in hospital, adding to overcrowdingConcerned among representative bodies about plan to free garda\u0026iacute for frontline dutiesReport finds minority Muslim group faces difficulties with language and employmentSystem for launching small craft found to be in bad repairAssault on Muslim teenager in Dundrum and death threat to UCC lecturer raise concernsT\u0026aacutenaiste to accompany US vice-president on visit to Cliffs of Moher during two-day visitCaseload has decreased every year since the controversial court was establishedJust 127 children have attended urgent care facility since opening in JulyCountess of Dunraven donates plaster mask for display in Derrynane House museumHSE says delays for entry to the scheme have risen to an average of six or seven weeksTotal of 384 children are in receipt of home tuition grants, latest figures showCameroonian singer who arrived here in 2013 says music helped her through bad timesBritish owners of Donegal Animal Hospital cite shortage of vets and other \u0026lsquolegal\u0026rsquo issuesAlternative proposals backer urges Dublin to talk to London about no-dealTaoiseach threatens to vote against deal backed by Hogan over rainforest wildfires"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3995625.1566590514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland must open up to plan b to backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBorder fears: “It would be a lot better to have an actual proper conversation now rather than wait until the 11th hour when we are in the worst possible situation.”  Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe Government needs to open up and discuss a plan B to the Brexit backstop, according to the chair of the technical group behind proposed alternative arrangements embraced by new British prime minister Boris Johnson. Shanker Singham, an adviser on trade who chairs the technical panel of the non-governmental Alternative Arrangements Commission, said he did not think it “wise” for Dublin not to discuss a possible no-deal exit with London given the heightened risk that this scenario could happen by the next Brexit deadline of October 31st. He said that it was essential for the Irish, British and French customs authorities to have “critical conversations” to avoid the disruption of a no-deal “that are not happening now.” Tánaiste Simon Coveney this week ruled out direct discussions with the UK around preparing for a no-deal. “The best approach from the Irish Government would be to open up and at least have a discussion about these things,” Mr Singham told The , referring to the alternative to the backstop his group had proposed, which includes a proposal to create a new common food safety zone covering Ireland and the UK.‘Proper conversation’“We may be at a point late in October where we have to have discussions. It would be a lot better to have an actual proper conversation now rather than wait until the 11th hour when we are in the worst possible situation.”In meetings with the French and German leaders this week, Mr Johnson referred to the alternative arrangements proposed last month by the group led by former Conservative minister Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan, now UK culture secretary, that would avoid the UK entering the backstop.The backstop is the insurance plan within the proposed withdrawal agreement covering the UK’s exit from the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the absence of another solution being found in future. The House of Commons has rejected the withdrawal agreement three times amid fears the backstop could tie the UK to EU economic rules indefinitely. Mr Johnson has demanded that the backstop be scrapped. Backstop supersededTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he would listen to Mr Johnson’s alternative proposals and if he can convince the EU and Ireland, which has ruled out reopening the Brexit agreement, that they could supersede the backstop. Mr Singham said his group had been in discussions with Downing Street about its alternative arrangements.The commission would be publishing suggested changes to the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration, the non-binding road map setting out a future EU-UK trade deal, “in the course of the next week or so” that would add more detail to its proposed arrangements around the alternative to the backstop, he said.Mr Singham said he could “sympathise” with Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney if the choice around the UK’s exit was either the alternative arrangements or the backstop, but he added that “the game has changed completely in Westminster” with the election of Mr Johnson as prime minister. “We are now in a world where the choice is alternative arrangements versus no-deal, not alternative arrangements versus backstop. In that world I think you would want to be talking,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

It also suggests that search could be more likely to find life on exoplanets than we had thought.This is a surprising conclusion, said lead researcher Dr Stephanie Olson.\u0026nbspIt shows us that conditions on some exoplanets with favourable ocean circulation patterns could be better suited to support life that is more abundant or more active than life on Earth.In recent years, scientists have found huge numbers of exoplanets, or worlds orbiting around stars that are not our own. But they are all very far away – impossible to reach even with the fastest space probes, and difficult even to see in any detail.Researchers are working on a variety of ways to learn about those worlds, including telescopes that will be able to sniff their atmospheres and learn more about what the planets could be made of. But to understand the information that comes back, scientists need to build detailed and complicated models of how planets form and their climates work.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

The work was presented at the\u0026nbspGoldschmidt\u0026nbspGeochemistry\u0026nbspCongress in\u0026nbspBarcelona.Nasa watching planet for signs of alien life after discoveryNASA\u0027s search for life in the Universe is focused on so-called Habitable Zone planets, which are worlds that have the potential for liquid water oceans, she said.\u0026nbspBut not all oceans are equally hospitable – and some oceans will be better places to live than others due to their global circulation patterns.To conduct the study, the team made models of those planets using Nasa software, which allows them to simulate the conditions on those exoplanets. Using that Nasa technology, they were able to create models of the possible climates and oceans that could be on those exoplanets.They found that many of them seemed like more hospitable and flourishing places for life than even Earth is. They looked at the process in Earth\u0027s oceans that allows life to take root down here – and considered whether that same process could be happening elsewhere in the universe.Our work has been aimed at identifying the exoplanet oceans which have the greatest capacity to host globally abundant and active life, said Dr Olson in a statement.Life in Earth\u0027s oceans depends on upwelling (upward flow) which returns nutrients from the dark depths of the ocean to the sunlit portions of the ocean where photosynthetic life lives. More upwelling means more nutrient resupply, which means more biological activity.These are the conditions we need to look for on exoplanets.By modelling a variety of different exoplanets, the researchers were able to think about which types would be most likely to develop and then sustain life. And they were surprised to find that Earth is not the best kind – and that there may be other worlds out there that are a far better place for life to begin.We have used an ocean circulation model to identify which planets will have the most efficient upwelling and thus offer particularly hospitable oceans, she said.\u0026nbspWe found that higher atmospheric density, slower rotation rates, and the presence of continents all yield higher upwelling rates.A further implication is that Earth might not be optimally habitable – and life elsewhere may enjoy a planet that is even more hospitable than our own.The work is important because our technology means that we are unable to see everything: there is almost certainly more life than we will ever be able to see, even with the most advanced telescopes and other equipment. That means scientists will need to optimise their search by looking at the planets where life will find it easiest to find a home.We expect oceans to be important in regulating some of the most compelling remotely detectable signs of life on habitable worlds, but our understanding of oceans beyond our solar system is currently very rudimentary, said\u0026nbspChris\u0026nbspReinhard, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, who wasn\u0027t involved in the study.\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspOlson\u0027s work represents a significant and exciting step forward in our understanding of exoplanet oceanography.The new research could now help inform how new telescopes are built, since we now know what kinds of planets will be best to search for. Now we know what to look for, so we need to start looking, said Dr Olson.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”.

The first of a number of future Star Wars TV series on Disney+,\u0026nbspThe Mandalorian stars Pedro Pascal as a lone bounty hunter roaming the wasteland left behind after the downfall of the Empire at the end of Return of the Jedi.Pascal is surrounded by an eclectic cast that includes Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposito, Gina Carano, Nick Nolte and the literal Werner Herzog, who is reliably snarling and menacing in the trailer.Following years of speculation, Ewan McGregor is indeed returning to the Star Wars universe and reprising his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi. According to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, the scripts for the series have already been written, with production due to begin in 2020.It was previously reported that the character, played by Alec Guinness in the original trilogy, would be getting his own film, but following the disappointing box office performance of the Han Solo spin-off movie Solo: A Star Wars Story, the studio has decided to proceed with the project on the small screen.Ms Marvel, She-Hulk and Moon KnightWhile we know little about any of these projects\u0026nbspother than the fact that they’re in development, TV series based on comic book characters Ms Marvel, She-Hulk and Moon Knight are in the pipeline. In her current incarnation, Ms Marvel is the first Muslim superhero to headline her own Marvel comic book. Moon Knight is a former US marine who transforms into a costumed vigilante at night, while She-Hulk is historically the cousin of male-Hulk Dr Bruce Banner.According to the Hollywood Reporter, British writer and comedian Bisha K Ali will write the Ms Marvel series.After appearing on stage to perform a rendition of “We’re All In This Together” from the original High School Musical, the cast of the TV series adaptation introduced the show’s first trailer. The new High School Musical is in truth a mockumentary (which explains the convoluted title) that follows a group of high school students auditioning for their school play… which is High School Musical itself.Lady and the TrampThe first trailer for Disney’s live-action remake of the animated classic was also released. The new film finds Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux voicing the dogs of the title, with real-life rescue dogs supplying their form (though with some CGI assistance to make their mouths move). Kiersey Clemons and Thomas Mann are Lady’s live-action owners, while Janelle Monae, Sam Elliott and Ken Jeong are among the supporting voiceover cast.Disney+ launches on 12 November in the US, Canada,\u0026nbspAustralia and the Netherlands, but a UK launch date remains unannounced so far.Lady and the Tramp\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17.

On Friday, the website still showed the remaining property – a five-bedroom house – as available for sale at a price of £875,000.One HAB investor, who put in several thousand pounds, was quoted as saying: “I’m disappointed that what I saw as an idealistic project seems to be collapsing on a sour note, with the original directors having departed and investors seemingly left to bear the entire financial burden of a failed enterprise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I will of course do everything in my power to improve the current situation but I cannot discuss anything else at this point because we are, importantly, trying to find a resolution with both the mini-bond investors and the company.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But despite her long comic book history, a number of iniduals have taken to Disney’s official Instagram to complain about the series, which was announced yesterday, and what they have interpreted as merely a gender-switched version of The Hulk.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Clark Mindock reports from IowaClick to followThe Independent USWith the UK facing an uncertain future as Boris Johnson marches the country towards a no-deal Brexit, American farmers can’t help but see something of a golden opportunity to bring their goods into a new market.While many US farmers have historically been turned away from trading with the United Kingdom over fears for the implications of practices such as washing chickens in chlorine, or the use of genetically modified crops, Britain’s impending exit from the EU has left some dreaming of a change to that situation.On a recent blistering summer day in Iowa, the idea was hard to avoid for farmers like Leon Sheets, a pork producer from the northeast of the state who also maintains 600 acres of row crops.“Hey, let’s have the conversation. Let’s work out a deal,” Mr Sheets said, emulating the kind of language one might expect from Donald Trump.When prodded further, Mr Sheets acknowledged that he hopes to see a post-Brexit trade deal that would allow for the introduction of products that have previously been off the table: “That’s what the goal is – no restrictions, so products can move freely back and forth.”It is an issue that has received backing from prominent American farming executives, even if some lip service has been given to having “a conversation” about the US food standards that have worried some in the UK.Currently farming exports to Britain – including wine, nuts and fruit – are worth only about $1.8bn (£1.47bn), a fraction of the total overall sales of $133bn. That means there is potentially massive room for growth, under the right circumstances.With the US saying that the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal following Brexit, Zippy Duvall, the head of the American Farm Bureau, recently said that they are eagerly watching for ways to begin a trade partnership – but that Britain had to accept US standards.PM warned US trade deal ‘highly unlikely’ if Ireland has hard borderGovernment finally hands firms customs numbers for post-Brexit tradeTrump vows to continue China trade war even if recession hits USAs Britain seeks new trade deals, can we learn a lesson from Poldark?UK told to accept US food standards in any trade deal“You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer himself, recently told the BBC.He claimed it was not a public health issue, saying: “So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market should be taken away. If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chlorine-washed bagged salads are sold in the UK and other countries in the EU, for instance.But what is of concern is that relying on chlorine washes – which proponents say makes harmful bacteria virtually undetectable – at the end of the process allows farmers to keep unsanitary conditions for the chickens earlier on. And the wash could allow for crowded abattoirs where disease could theoretically spread with greater ease.While it is tricky to compare the rates of food-borne illnesses between two countries, two separate studies would suggest that the US experiences higher rates of salmonella infection. One British government study from 2014 found that there were roughly 55 salmonella infections per 100,000 people, when analysing 2009 data. A separate study of the US found a rate of 350 infections per 100,000 people, using data from 2002-2008.When it comes to deaths, the US also reports higher numbers. While the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reports around 380 deaths a year due to food-borne salmonella, England and Wales had zero such deaths between 2006 and 2015, according to the most recently available data from Public Health England.Gail Soutar, the chief European Union exit and international trade adviser for the National Farmers Union (NFU), said that there was a considerable level of anxiety that a hasty and chaotic Brexit could leave UK farmers competing against a flood of international goods coming in, and undermining their prices.Ms Soutar says she is particularly concerned at the prospect of a no-deal outcome, and the impact that subsequently high tariffs on UK agricultural products could have. Farmers, she worries, could be threatened by a flood of new goods being brought in from the US, which could undermine efforts to honour European Union standards – with the EU, for now, a much larger trading partner than the US.“There is a concern that we are going to see an increase of imports coming into the UK under a no-deal situation,” she said. “It remains absolutely key that we get a deal with the EU.”UK politicians have at least paid lip service to the notion that standards will not be abandoned in pursuit of a deal, with former environment secretary Michael Gove telling an NFU conference in\u0026nbspFebruary that they would not abandon those requirements “in pursuit of trade deals”.But thousands of miles away in Iowa, the outcome of negotiations between the UK and EU are understandably less of a concern for farmers. Whereas UK farmers may be feeling some anxiety, American farmers are clearly sensing opportunity.Bill Tenneger, a pig producer in northwest Iowa, sat back with a sparkle in his eye when asked about the potential for a trade deal with the UK. Mr Tenneger said that Donald Trump’s trade war with China had been hurting farmers like him, but he thinks Mr Trump could potentially capitalise on a weak negotiating position following Brexit.But he said he hoped it would help British people out too: “I think trade agreements are good. Hey, it’s a small world. We’ve all got to get along in the world. I’ve travelled all over the world representing the pork industry.“In the end, I don’t care what culture you go to or you get embedded in, they all just want to feed their families and support their families and have the government leave them alone.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Or perhaps it’s gingerism Either way, it’s smoke-and-mirrors nonsense designed to deflect from the reality that the public is wearied and irritated by the constant proselytising of a young couple who don’t appear to practise what they preach.This is the problem when Royal Family members abandon the monarchy’s long-held tenet of “never complain, never explain” and start making political statements about how the proles should live their lives.It’s an obvious side-effect that, emboldened by the proleration of social media, one’s once loyal subjects might rise up and have a few strident opinions of their own.Particularly when they’ve just contributed £.million for your “cottage” to be done up.Sir Elton John — with whom they have been staying on their most recent holiday to Nice — appears to blame the media for what he claims was a “distorted and malicious” account of the trip, adding for good measure that he wanted to protect the young couple from the “unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death”.Hmmm. Putting aside the observation thatyou want to avoid press coverage then boarding a private plane to stay with an A-lister is perhaps ill-advised, it’s widely acknowledged that Princess Diana was safely ensconced inside the Paris Ritz when she and Dodi took the fateful decision to leave their suite at midnight and get in a car that, unbeknown to them, was being driven by someone . times over the limit and speeding.A French judicial investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.But eventhey had been, just like the detracting cry of “racism”, Harry’s tragic loss of his mother shouldn’t be used to try to shut down valid criticism about him and Meghan virtue-signalling their “woke” credentials then hopping on four flights that emit an estimated seven tonnes of CO.Judging by online message boards, the Diana-loving public certainly aren’t buying it.I’ve been a journalist for a long time and know that, whatever I choose to write, people make up their own mind about the issues of the day.And the majority view on the royal couple’s gas-guzzling transportation is that it’s hypocritical.Equally, climate change activists say the same. Or are they being misquoted by the evil media Harry’s impeccably dutul grandmother the Queen understands that the role of the Royal Family is to turn up to a community centre on a wet and windy day and shake the hands of those in society who put in real graft on behalf of others — therefore highlighting a good cause and hopefully encouraging others to do their bit.In other words, leading by example rather than constantly telling everyone how they should be thinking and feeling.Particularly when the Smiths of Acacia Avenue are being made to feel guilty for boarding a budget airline on their one week’s holiday a year and don’t have multi-millionaire friends to offset their carbon foot-print with an “appropriate contribution” to a climate change initiative.It’s a simple truth that, were the Sussexes buckling down and just quietly getting on with their royal duties like Princess Anne et al, they could visit Beyonce George Elton whoever on privately-funded luxury flights and few would question it.But entitled “do as we say, not as we do” hypocrisy should always be called out.IT was perhaps inevitable that the marriage of Strictly pro dancers Neil and Katya Jones would hit the rocks after that kiss.After all, the encounter between Katya and her Strictly  partner Seann Walsh wasn’t just any old snog, it was a Marks  Spencer’s chocolate pudding snog – all dark and mysterious with an explosive centre.It was furtive, hurried, messy and forbidden – everything that a kiss within the confines of a long-term relationship rarely is.However drunk you are, you only kiss someone like that when you’re a a teenager at the local disco or b looking for something, or someone, that’s missing from what you already have.And that’s a tough reality to move on from.Bruised by the humiliation of glaring headlines and the unremitting scrutiny of the public gaze, it’s understandable that they deployed “nothing to see here” mode – swearing undying love for each other and clamping on fixed smiles for any photographer within a -yard radius.But behind closed doors, the recriminations clearly began and, ten months on, their -year relationship is over.The end of a marriage is always sad but, all credit to them, they have vowed to remain friends and professional dancing partners.Now they can both kiss who they want.THE new leader of Ukip is a Richard Braine – a name that has led to plenty of “Dick Braine” ­joshing and articles about other people with ­unfortunate monikers.One of them being my nemesis on a charity edition of The Chase. “Which of these is a Dutch politician ” Bradley Walsh asked me . . . for £,.Ruud Bum, Luuk Bonkers or Tiny Kox were the options and I went for Ruud on the basis footballer Ruud Gullit was from the Netherlands and no one who spoke English as well as the Dutch do would call their son Tiny Kox.But, as this photo shows, I was shocked to learn it was Tiny Kox, a Dutch senator and Socialist Party­ member.He’ll fit right in should he choose to pay a visit to Corbyn and his comrades.FORMER Page  favourite Linda Lusardi is now  and has posed in the same gold bikini she wore in her modelling heyday.If anything, she looks better in it now.She credits her youthful look to good genes and not eating unless she’s hungry, but there’s another crucial factor too – happiness.Linda has been married to actor Sam Kane for  years and a more easy-going, devoted couple you could not wish to find.She says: “I’m in a good place. I have a very happy le, happy marriage and two great kids who are doing what they want to do. That’s all I need.”Indeed. Inner contentment is the greatest anti-ageing formula there is.Don’t I know it.In Mexico, The Bloke said: “Seen one old building, seen ’em all,” as I headed off to Chichen Itza and he headed for a sun lounger.And when I once suggested a safari in Africa, he replied: “No thanks, I’ll watch it on the Discovery Channel.”I got him to come to Rome’s Colosseum once, but only because it was raining and there was a recommended restaurant right opposite.Dear reader, I married him.MICHAEL Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones have posted a charming photograph of a family lunch that includes their two teenage children, Michael’s brothers and nephews, and his once troubled son Cameron from his first marriage.Now , Cameron – who credits Catherine and Michael for sticking by him – has turned a corner and is happily married with a young daughter.Proof,needed, that Hollywood royalty or not, every family has its ups and downs and all that matters as your le nears its end are the loving people that  surround  you.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU has tied us in so much red tape over the past few decades that untangling it won’t be an overnight job.But Britain has survived far worse.ELTON John’s “defence” of Harry and Meghan’s private jet jollies completely misses the point.It’s not about privacy.

The two men were seen walking together a year after Epstein had been convicted.There are allegations — strongly denied by Buckingham Palace — that Andrew was more directly involved in Epstein’s sordid shenanigans.What cannot be denied is Andrew’s close friendship with the vile but powerful man.Remaining Epstein’s bosom buddy after he had been convicted certainly shows bad judgment.But then parts of Andy’s career as a royal have involved bad judgment.He apparently enjoys the retinue of rich and famous tossers who gather around him, no doubt anxious to be associated with the British crown.And he doesn’t seem to care very much how awful some of them are.This is shaping up to be a bad year for the Royal Family.Prince Andrew, never hugely adored by the public, could be a source of grave embarrassment to them.The public is also tiring of Harry and Meghan’s relentless political preaching, whining and hypocrisy. The private jets to climate change summits. The gobsmackingly expensive renovations to their house with wallpaper made of organic kale and goji berries, or something.It was reported this week that the Royal Family’s bill for travel and security has almost doubled since . Much of that is probably Meghan.But I think people are also weary of William seemingly talking about depression every time he opens his mouth.Hell, you’re depressed, Wills  Howja think the rest of us feel I’ve always been marginally in favour of having a royal family.But that’s contingent upon who that royal family actually is. And how they behave.The Queen and Prince Philhave been models of decency and duty. They keep a certain distance from the public and that is perhaps why they are so adored.To her immense credit, Princess Anne has followed that blueprint. She doesn’t emote for the media and lecture us.My worry is that the newer generation of royals will turn the British public against the Windsors. In Andrew’s case, befriending a scumbag has brought disgrace upon him and the family firm.With Harry and Meghan and William, it’s a case of trying to be too modern and thus losing sight of what it means to be a member of the Royal Family.Keep on this track and we won’t have a royal family for very much longer.A FADING reality star called Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace has had a mega boob implant. She went for the maximum allowed in the UK – ml.As you can imagine, they look pretty ridiculous. She has a way to go, though, to beat doolally German model Martina Big whose baps check in at  litres.And indeed Lacey Wildd, whose  breasts weigh more than lbs each and actually glow in the dark.Maybe Aisleyne could next buy some jubblies that do magic tricks or something.IT’S not often this column comes to the defence of Gary Lineker.Truth be told, I’m a little bit weary of the jug-eared, virtue-signalling, overpaid, crisp-flogging dimbo.But he’s in trouble for having made a joke – not a funny joke, obvs – about his co-presenters being bald. That’s Alan Shearer and Danny Murphy.Cue outrage from the follically challenged members of the public.It is now almost impossible to make a joke about anything without someone wetting the bed and writing a letter of ­complaint.How did we get so thin-skinned in this country Lower the tone  Always happy to oblige.Stop bullying people, you third world dog-munching commies.THE Queen’s pharmacist, Ainsworths, is selling homeopathic remedies.These are remedies which do not work.Homeopathy is a charlatan movement in denial of science.One of the remedies sold is “Berlin Wall”. This claims to have the spirit of the Berlin Wall in it.And the homeopaths suggest it might be good for healing relationships.I used to think homeopathy should be banned outright.But now I think – hell,you’re dumb enough to believe that rubbish, good luck to you.BORIS Johnson is stamping around Europe demanding the EU scrap the ridiculous Northern Ireland backstop.He’s absolutely right to do so.If only this had been done three years ago, we’d have a decent deal and be free of the EU by now.But time is short. And the EU knows that Boris still doesn’t have a majority in parliament to push No Deal through, no matter what he says.So they will be less likely to agree to concessions.It just makes you weep at three wasted years.When we were led by a Prime Minister who didn’t think we SHOULD leave the EU.And caved in on every issue.Just two thirds  What kind of drugs are the other third on  Horse tranquillisers and crack Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t make a very good caretaker of a carpet warehouse, never mind PM.THEY’RE trying to improve the look of Sunderland. No easy task, you might think.And so the city’s Business Improvement District has put out a notice politely asking residents to stop pooing in the streets.Apparently it’s all the rage up there.The BID people said: “Disappointingly we’ve seen an increase in people thinking it is absolutely acceptable to defecate or urinate in public in our city centre. This will not be tolerated.”I think they’re being a bit heavy-handed. Maybe as a compromise measure they should just hand out little black poo bags to everybody.You Mackems, huh.

Without wanting to be trivial, he’s just into straight forward sex between consenting adults.”The Prince’s close circle insist he is not doing anything wrong and his desire to have frequent new relationships is one reason why he has not formalised his reunion with Fergie.The pal said: “It’s one of the reasons why I don’t think he would ever re-marry Sarah. They are great friends and wonderful parents but it would interfere with Andrew’s lestyle too much.“He’s a charmer but most of the romances fizzle out, and that’s why he’s kept the stability of being close to Sarah.

After ing from the Falklands War in  — where he served as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot — he resumed a romance with American actress Koo Stark, said to be “the love of his le”.But the pair split in  after intense media interest.Before his marriage to Fergie, Andrew was romantically linked to two Bond girls — former Miss UK Carolyn Seaward, who went on to star in Octopussy, and KatieRabett who was in The Living Daylights. Andrew and Fergie got hitched in  and went on to have daughters Beatrice, , and Eugenie, .The marriage became strained with Andrew away for long periods with the Navy. The couple split in  and orced in .Four years later Andrew was pictured with model Heidi Klum, at her Hookers and Pimps party in New York. The following year he dined with another model,Caprice Bourret, at St James’s Palace. Prince Andrew remained close to Epstein even after the billionaire was jailed in  for soliciting a minor for prostitution.This week Buckingham Palace said: “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes.“His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”PRINCE Andrew was reportedly seen in Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion getting a foot rub from two young women.The encounter was detailed in emails between literary agent John Brockman and writer Evgeny Morozov.Mr Brockman said it came when he visited Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial for child sex trafficking, at his Manhattan home.In the September  emails, he said he walked in to find a British man wearing a suit and braces and “getting foot massages from two young well-dressed Russian women”.The writer recounts how they discussed Sweden’s attempt to put Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on trial.Mr Brockman reports Andrew saying: “We think they’re liberal in Sweden, but it’s more like Northern England as opposed to Southern Europe.”He adds that he then complained about his public le, saying: “In Monaco, Albert works  hours a day but at pm, when he goes out, he does whatever he wants and nobody cares. But,I do it, I’m in big trouble.”At that point, Mr Brockman says: “I realized that the recipient of Irina’s foot massage was his Royal Highness, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.”It not known when the encounter took place but Buckingham Palace has previously insisted Andrew, , had no contact with Epstein after . Sources close to the duke said it was not an account he recognised.Andrew, whose marriage to Sarah Ferguson broke up when she was seen having her toe sucked by her financier lover, was filmed at Epstein’s home in .Meanwhile, prosecutors in France have opened an investigation into Epstein.

A disaster. A “catastrophic ­national danger”, according to the feverish .They say Britain is on a “clf edge”. If we leave without a deal it will be a “car crash”.It will bring the “hardship of war” raining down upon us, says one Brexitphobic columnist. These people seem to live in a permanent state of dread.They’re forever fantasising about a desolate post-Brexit world in which there will be “riots, looting and disorder”as zombied Brits fight each other for scraps of food and bottles of medicine.The rest of us, however, have a rather dferent take on No Deal. Across the country, far from the political bubbles and ivory towers inhabited by these anti-Brexit hysterics, people are far more chilled out about the prospect of No Deal.You hear it in everyday ­conversations: “If the EU won’t give us a good deal, let’s leave without one.”You see it on Question Time when the audience applauds a list who says we should walk away from the EUit keeps messing us about. And you see it in opinion polls, too.Much to the horror of the Brexit-bashing elites, polls show that ordinary people do not think No Deal will be the end of the world as we know it.A recent Opinium poll asked people what we should doBoris Johnson fails to wring concessions from the EU and to change the Withdrawal Agreement to make it more palatable to MPs.A whopping  per cent said we should go ahead with Brexit on October  — Boris’s ­promised exit day — evenwe don’t have a deal.Just  per cent said we should cancel Brexit altogether and  per cent said we should continue with negotiations.This echoes a YouGov poll from a few months ago. It asked what we should dothe EU refused to grant an extension to talks on the exit deal.Forty-four per cent said we should say adios without a deal. Forty-two per cent said we should revoke Brexit and stay bound to Brussels.This is all incredibly revealing. No, it does not suggest millions of us are reckless and crazy and hell-bent on jumping off the “clf edge”.Most Brits, including Boris himself, would prefer to leave with a deal,a good one can be struck.No, what the polls show is that there is only so much baloney from the EU that we are willing to take.If Eurocrats carry on behaving stubbornly and arrogantly by refusing to reopen talks about the Withdrawal Agreement, then we should show some self-respect and walk away — that is what people are saying.This captures one of the key ides between the elites and ordinary people today. The political and media classes dread No Deal because they have lost faith in Britain.They view the UK as a tiny, pathetic island that could never possibly cope outside of the EU.They think we need to be looked after by the apparently caring, maternal figure of the Brussels bureaucracy. Andwe do the political equivalent of cutting the apron strings, we will be doomed, apparently.In the rest of the country, meanwhile, people have far more faith in the nation.They believe we are more than capable of being a sovereign, independent country that strikes its own trade deals and writes its own laws.They see the country not as a useless little island, but as a plucky, resourceful nation that should reach out to the world without being beholden to any of it.The ide over No Deal reveals how much disagreement there is between the political elites and the people today.It is hard to remember a time when the chasm between Us and Them was as wide as it is right now.The th Century Prime ­Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said the UK feels like “two nations”. In one nation there are the posh and well-educated, and in the other there are ­ordinary working people.These “two nations” have entirely dferent “habits, thoughts, and feelings”, he wrote. It is asthey are “inhabitants of dferent planets”.It feels like that again today. On the planet of the Remainer elites, No Deal will be terrible, Boris is the worst PM ever, and anyone who ­disagrees is probably a racist.But on the planet inhabited by the rest of us, No Deal will be fine. And support for the Boris-led Conservative Party is rising. Surging, in fact.The latest Britain Elects ­opinion poll shows that  per cent of us would vote for the Tories, compared with just  per cent for Labour.But their shrill cries make no impact on our planet. In our more sane world, we still want Brexit to happen and we think Britain is a good, decent, capable country.The elites should come over to our planet.

I have stayed in a number of his residences.At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.Disgraced financier Epstein, , hanged himself in his New York jail cell on August  amid a string of multi-million dollar lawsuits brought by some of his alleged victims.Andrew was notoriously photographed with his arm around Epstein’s alleged “sex slave” Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, when she was .But he has denied sleeping with her and declared himself “appalled” by reports of his former friend’s “alleged crimes”.Ms Giuffres claims against Andrew were struck from a court case in .The judge ruled they were “immaterial and impertinent”.And Andrew today reiterated it was a mistake seeing Epstein after his release from an -month prison term in  for prostituting minors.He was pictured with the financier in Central Park, New York, at the time and footage emerged of him at Epsteins home in the city in .He said: I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release in  and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.I have tremendous sympathy for all those affected by his actions and behaviour.His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.This is a dficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epsteins lestyle.

Conservative grandee Sir Edward Leigh has tabled  questions about the planned National Holocaust Memorial Centre and Learning Service since June . Yet the MP has asked just three written questions about his Lincolnshire constituency in the same period. The right-winger has previously spoken out against the £million Holocaust museum project, dismissing it as “really just a gimmick”. And he has levelled a series of questions at the Communities Department, which is responsible for the scheme.    According to the House of Commons, each written question costs £ - meaning Sir Edward is likely to have lumped taxpayers with a £, bill. His Westminster home is just  yards from the proposed memorial site in Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the Houses of Parliament.Labour MP John Mann, who supports the tribute and chairs Parliament’s cross-party group on anti-Semitism, said Sir Edward’s interest was “very, very odd in my view”.Mr Mann, whose Bassetlaw constituency in Notts borders Sir Edward’s own seat of Gainsborough, added: “It is surprising that he is so upset. “He’s my next-door neighbour and I haven’t noticed any opposition to the memorial from anybody in his constituency or mine. “I have had nobody raise it with me negatively at all and I don’t believe there is anybody who has any opposition at all to it in Gainsborough – probably most people don’t give a damn either way. “He needs to chill out on it.”    Mr Mann said it would be “helpful”Sir Edward revealed whether his interest stemmed from being “a near-neighbour” of the proposed site.Due to be completed in , the Holocaust memorial was announced by David Cameron in January , five months before he quit as Prime Minister in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum result.But the proposed location alongside the River Thames triggered opposition from a range of campaigners. Experts warn it will hamper views of the Palace of Westminster and worsen congestion around the World Heritage Site. Writing in , Sir Edward laid out his objections to the location - but failed to mention he lived nearby. He wrote in the Times: “This site is already a heavily-trafficked area. “The traffic and access pressure will overwhelm Millbank at a location not capable of accommodating such a volume of people and vehicles, especially coaches.

Nathan McGough immediately thought of the horror of nearby Grenfell Tower when his daughter told him of the fire at roughly midday today. And the three of them only discovered the fire had broken out when a friend on a neighbouring tower block told them via social media. The -year-old was enjoying a relaxing morning in his top-floor flat with his girlfriend and daughter when the blaze broke out at Markland House, less than a mile from Grenfell. Speaking toNathan, who has lived in the building for  years, said there was no smoke alarm.    I live on the top floor, the th floor, he said. I was at home with my girlfriend and daughter having a relaxing day. Out of nowhere they both shouted that the block was on fire. I looked out the window and I could see smoke. I looked down and I could see flames licking out of the flat eight floors below us. Thataposs when I realised something pretty serious was happening. We live next to Grenfell Tower, I remember that, everyone does.  Nathan, who now manages London band White Lies, quickly got wet towels, grabbed his two dogs and headed down the stairs to safety. It was pretty frightening. Once we passed the level where the fire was we felt a lot safer. Ever since Grenfell the fact I lived on the top floor was something on my mind. We knew that the stairs were the only exit. On the eighth floorthere was some smoke but it was not too bad. We saw firemen coming up as we were heading down. The fire brigade got there really quickly. You do not have much time to think, youaposre just in preservation mode. Once we got outside we felt a sense of relief. Afterwards, once the adrenalin has left, you realise that it was a really close call.    Nathan says he was told be a member of the London Fire Brigadeat the tower block that the cause of the fire was a residents barbecue on their balcony. A spokesman for the LFB toldthat a full and thorough investigation into the fire is ongoing and they would not comment on the cause until that was complete. Nathan said: After Grenfell we were told you could not have a barbecue on your balcony but it appears someone has ignored that advice. There was no alarm. My daughter was notied by someone who got in touch with her on social media. I have lived here for  years and I have never haerd an alarm being tested or anything. Each inidual flat does have a smoke alarm though.    Resident Dhin Chittenden told the BBC she cried as she ran down the steps from her flat on the th floor of the tower block. The -year-old receptionist, who has lived in the building with her husband for a month, said she was already fearful about another Grenfell Tower-type tragedy before the fire broke out. I kept thinking about that. If itaposs happened somewhere  then it could happen again, she said.

The £ a head flight would do signicantly less environmental damage per passenger than a specially chartered private plane.

Kate, Will and their kids then got on this plane rather than the smaller Loganair plane initially intended to make the trip. Flight logs show that the plane flew  miles down to Norfolk early on Thursday morning, with its identication number EZEP reportedly indicating it was empty. The Cambridges slipped onto the plane at the last minute, rather than the smaller Logan Air aircraft earmarked to make the flight up to Aberdeen.    The .am flight is normally operated by Loganair on behalf of Eastern Airways, which is Flybeaposs franchise partner. The two empty flights would be responsible for an extra . tonnes of carbon emissions - just shy of half of one British personaposs annual carbon footprint. A spokesperson for Flybe said: Flybe denies any involvement in the decision over which aircraft to fly on this route, which is fully operated by Eastern Airways. On Saturday morning an Eastern Airways spokesperson said the company took full responsibility for the additional flight. They said: “Eastern Airways can confirm any decision as to which aircraft operated the Norwich-Aberdeen service on Thursday morning was entirely that of Eastern Airways and not that of Flybe as reported.

Christina Anderson,  and from San Diego, US, was in May preparing for her dream wedding to Brandon Jensen when the room began to spin so much she couldnapost stop vomiting and was unable to walk straight. She was immediately taken to hospital where she underwent a CT scan. Christina, a nurse, said she  knew something was up as the doctors took a really, really long time to give her an answer. They eventually went up to her, sat by her side and told her they had found a brain tumour just behind her right ear.  The bride-to-be was told that while it was a hemangioblastoma, a non-cancerous tumour, she would still have to undergo immediate surgery to get the -inch lump removed or it would end up killing her.“At that point, I knew what it meant, but I was kind of in denial because I didn’t really understand the severity of it,” Anderson says, the New York Post reports.Despite her eight-hour surgery looming ahead, Christinaaposs only concern was how she would be able to carry out the preparations for her wedding in August while trying to recover. “I asked Dr. Sharmathey’d have to chop any hair off and he said yes,” Christina said. “That was the part that I was stuck on the most because I was like, ‘I’m getting married in August, I can’t have my hair missing.’ ” While patients would usually have all their heads shaved off for infection control, doctors made an exception for the bride and only removed a small lock of her brunette hair.  Following her highly successful surgery on May  Christina immediately started physiotherapy to learn how to walk again. She had to use a walking aid for months but said she would keep hiding it from herself so she wouldnapost be tempted to use it and could be back on her own two feet in time for the big day.“I was going to crawl down that aisle before I had to use the walker,” Christina Anderson told Today . “It was not an option for me.”Christina managed to fulfill her dream and walked down the aisle - evenin Crocs - for her special day on August .

However, that’s where the problems began for the manager in terms of his subs.Left on the bench was centre-back and club captain Josh Meekings alongside youngsters Callum Moore, Max Anderson and Michael Cunningham.Unless you’re changing a centre-back in the closing stages, that’s slim pickings for a game that size against a good outfit in Aberdeen.And that’s not me saying the kids at Dens aren’t good enough for the first team, don’t go doubting yourselves yet, lads.In a situation like that, however, with a few minutes to go and a goal up, experience is absolutely vital.With four minutes of the  left, winger Josh Todd ‘blew up’, in the manager’s words, and forced a decision on the gaffer. Put on a young player in Todd’s position to run about or opt for the experienced man, club captain no less, but change the set-up on the pitch that had coped so well with the Aberdeen attack.Meekings was the man chosen to see the game out but that allowed the Dons space up the field to start launching balls into the box and pile the pressure on the home side.Sadly that told and Dundee miss out on a trip to Tynecastle in the quarters.What it did show is this Dark Blues side will take some beating this season. It is clear more bodies are needed, though."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d5a6749ec7308.34715090.jpg ","title":"mcghee backing dundee to get over cup loss in time for ict clash and dundee derby","story":"Defender Jordan McGhee says Dundee need to put Sunday’s cup “sucker-punch” behind them and concentrate on a big couple of weeks in their league campaign.The Dark Blues were minutes away from a fine Betfred Cup victory over Aberdeen at Dens Park at the weekend only for Andrew Considine to strike in stoppage time.The Dons then went on to book their place in the quarter-finals through Sam Cosgrove’s extra-time winner.McGhee revealed the Dundee players were gutted come the final whistle but reckons the Dark Blues can carry that impressive performance into the Championship campaign.And, with two tough fixtures coming next against Inverness and rivals Dundee United, it would be the perfect time to do just that.McGhee told the Tele: “We were devastated at the end.“We more than matched Aberdeen over the  minutes, got ourselves in front, and rightly so, but got the sucker-punch at the end.“It was devastating but it showed just how far we’ve come as a new team together, competing with the third-best team in Scotland.“That’s the best side we’ve played in a competitive game and we more than matched them and were unlucky not to come away with the win.“We need to take that into the league games, dust ourselves down and go again for a massive game on Saturday and then an even bigger game against Dundee United the week after.“We need to get going again because the Championship is a tough league, a good league, and there’s not much in it between a lot of the Championship teams and the Premiership ones.“We showed that on Sunday.”McGhee impressed alongside defensive partner Jordon Forster and dealt with the sizeable threat of Aberdeen frontman Sam Cosgrove well for the majority of the contest at Dens Park.However, the big man escaped their grip in stoppage time to set up the equaliser before rising to head in the winner in the rd minute.McGhee added: “I felt comfortable in the game.“Obviously, the long ball is a threat with Cosgrove being about ‘ft ’ but I thought we’d dealt with that well all game.“Then for the goal they lumped it long, won a couple of headers and it luckily landed at someone’s feet on the line. That was a sore one to take.“There were a lot of positives through the game and we were dferent class in all areas of the pitch.“We felt comfortable through the  minutes and then got the sucker-punch.“It was pleasing to play well on Sunday but, obviously, devastating to lose out. However, the performance was massive and we deserved more from the game.”McGhee was quick to praise the home support for their backing throughout the cup-tie and he plans to give them plenty more to shout about in the season ahead.He added: “The fans were great all day.“Even before we went - up, when we were pressing, winning tackles and headers and they were cheering and singing – that’s what we need and they give you that. We need to repay that kind of backing with performances on the pitch.“I didn’t realise just how good the support was until I signed.“Obviously, I’d played here for Hearts but when I signed I realised just how big it was from the first minute.“And that makes us want to repay them with a big season and to get the club back where it belongs.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/Sbro_Dundee_Death_City_Story-8-846x564.jpg ","title":"mystery of religious messages on walls across dundee solved","story":"Mysterious religious messages that have been appearing on walls across the city are “silent prayers” for lives lost to drugs in Dundee.Ric May and Stef Ollandini are among a group of seven people – known as the SO – who have been writing chalk messages in recent months.The Tele reported in July that unusual writings had been appearing on buildings across the city centre over the summer.At the same time, headstones in the Howff burial ground were defaced by graffiti scrawled in chalk which referenced Satan.Ric and Stef – who work with drug users – said today they had no part in the incidents of vandalism.They said members of the SO group had only written “Jesus” and symbols featuring a cross with a heart in areas such as Kirkton, the city centre and Lochee.Ric said: “The reaction from the public to us doing this has been extremely positive.“People come and approach us and stop to take pictures.“The messages symbolise lives lost to drugs in Dundee and are essentially silent prayers while sending a message to those left behind.“We have had a lot of engagement with homeless people and addicts who are very open to Jesus helping them.” vw, px\"  Stef said he was aware of other people drawing on walls and headstones across Dundee and said some of his own drawings had been defaced.He added: “Unfortunately we can’t stop anyone from adding things on.“We’ve also placed some of the markings on empty business premises – praying for more jobs.”Maryfield councillor Ken Lynn said previously the recent incidents were an unwelcome addition to the city centre.Both Ric and Stef stressed the messages they had left were written in chalk and they did not condone others who used spray paint. vw, px\"  Ric added: “This hasn’t only been done in Dundee.“We travel around the country to cities such as Edinburgh and Glasgow delivering the same message.”Both Ric and Stef are working on opening a live-in rehabilitation centre for addicts.In April, the pair appealed for funding in a bid to tackle the “vicious drug cycle” in Dundee."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d4d4fe53f1f97.56655478.jpg ","title":"pawlett is ready for starting place after heroics for dundee united against partick","story":"Peter Pawlett is back in contention for a Dundee United starting place after his super-sub heroics at Partick Thistle.And fellow-attacker Osman Sow did his prospects no harm by smashing in a hat-trick for the reserves yesterday.Pawlett made a surprisefrom his summer-long knee trouble when he came on at Firhill in the Tangerines’ last outing and grabbed the winner.That and a week-and-a-bit’s hard work in training since, as well as a run-out yesterday, has convinced boss Robbie Neilson the -year-old can be considered for  minutes at Dunfermline on Saturday.And Sow, who’s had a calf injury since pre-season, has also been building up steadily.“Peter came on the last game, got the last  minutes and did great, so he’s ready to go when we need him,” said Robbie.“Osman’s not far either. He’s been playing in the reserves and bounce games, he played yesterday as well.”Several others in need of game time also got a run-out as United’s second string thrashed Kilmarnock - at St Andrews yesterday.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"trailer load of cash raised for marie curie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOne lucky winner can look forward to a cosy winter after winning a trailer load of logs at Mid Argyll Show.The sticks were donated, as in previous years, by Ardrishaig#s Alan Ryan to the Mid Argyll Marie Curie Fundraising Group for their stand at the show.

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use. It is dangerous.ldquoThere never has been a route proposed on this application and there is still not one to this day.ldquoSo how could it have been approved, without knowing where the traffic is going Melrose community councillor Mr Douglas claimed SBC was ldquounnecessarily endangering the publicrsquos lives and putting financial expedience before public safety in a letter to council chief executive Tracey Logan.And he asked to see a copy of a lsquopre-planning application decisionrsquo on potential vehicle routes.But, in a response, Ms Logan said: ldquoI have been advised no such document exists.She added the council had considered a transport statement and a report from the public consultation process.However, she admitted: ldquoNo detail of vehicle routes was included within either document. This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic.... We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year.

The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop.

Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His object is a rare Slave Bible from , intended for use by slaves in the British West-India Islands.

The bible was among , books donated to the university by insurance broker William Euing in .ldquoBob Marley once sang about mental slavery lsquonone but ourselves can free our mindsrsquo. Pro-slavery lsquoChristiansrsquo were very deliberate in editing the Bible to exclude its most inconvenient truths about freedom, emancipation, liberty justice and mercy. Enslaved Africans and their descendants had these mental chains smelted from a peculiarly Scottish mixture of white-supremacist racial hatred and enlightenment rationalist missionary zeal. This bible was as effective a tool of enslavement as any cast-iron chains.CollectionsPROFESSOR Heather Ferguson, infectious disease ecologist, University of Glasgow. Her object is a Citron Bug . It is part of the collection of the anatomist and physician Dr William Hunter, who bequeathed his collections to the university for research and teaching. It originated from Equinoctial Africa and was collected by Henry Smeathman , an English naturalist who was paid to travel to Sierra Leone to collect and send back specimens to Europe to enrich scientic understanding. He and his insects travelled back to Europe via the West Indies aboard a slave ship.ldquoIn the th century, British entomologists carried out important research on the natural history of tropical insects. However, their methodologies were often exploitative, ignorant and inhumane. Today strict codes of ethics govern our work. Equitable partnerships with African scientists, communities and institutes are essential. It is not widely known that the founders of my discipline were involved in the slave trade in such a direct and disgraceful manner.

Objects in museums have the ability to speak to, or share, lsquohidden historiesrsquo from a multitude of perspectives.

From  to , Gilmorehill House was the family home of prominent West India merchants who traded in tobacco from plantations in the West Indies and the United States. Enslaved people were forced to work on those plantations. They themselves had been traded in West Africa for Scottish products such as cloth.ldquoThis is a deep reminder that we shouldnrsquot shy away from the past and face up to the flaws in our history.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour   s tortuous EU twist won   t halt a No Deal Brexit","story":"Europhiles in the Labour Party can hardly believe it. After three years trying to explain to bemused voters why Labour is backing Brexittheyrsquore now free to say what they always wanted: Labour is the party of Remain. Itrsquos out of the closet.Twitter trolls have been sent packing. The high priestess of Remain, the rsquos Polly Toynbee, has given her blessing. The hyperactive Labour peer, Lord Adonis, and the #FBPE philosopher, SC Grayling, are singing a duet of ldquoOh! Jeremy Corbyn. Tony Blair has been stunned into silence.However, long-standing Labour Remainers are just a little cautious about this conversion on the road to departure. And with cause. Mr Corbyn remains enigmatic, as always. It is not at all clear the Labour leader is personally planning to back Remain.:Bill for Citizens Assembly consultants nears pound,Moreover, Labour Party policy is still pro-Brexit. Its manesto commits a Labour government to accepting the results of the  referendum and leaving the European Union, ending free movement along the way. A General Election is possibly weeks away, yet an incoming Labour government is committed to negotiating a ldquobetter Brexit deal with Brussels.The new twist is that this new deal would be put to the voters of Britain in a ldquoconfirmatory referendum. But there is no presumption that Labour would campaign in favour of it. Indeed, leading figures like Ms Abbott and Mr McDonnell would clearly call for voters to reject Labourrsquos new deal.Letrsquos work this through: Prime Minister Corbynrsquos first act would be to approach Brussels for renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement. This would presumably include the things they wanted to tag on to Theresa Mayrsquos deal: Customs Union, regulatory alignment with the single market, job and environmental protections and so on.Now, there is every reason to suppose that Brussels would accept this new deal with alacrity, since it is very largely the arrangement it has with countries like Norway and Switzerland. Michel Barnier, or his successor, would welcome a prodigal Britain back into the fold. There would no longer be an Irish backstop because there would be no hard border.

Labour has always faced both ways on Brexit, but the new policy has turned incoherence into a fine art.How would this policy be framed in Labourrsquos General Election manesto  We will honour the  referendum and negotiate a jobs Brexit, which we will advise the people of Britain to reject. And wersquore not giving the referendum question because that would be ldquospeculative.Some in the Labour Party still believe that the ldquoconfirmatory ballot could be Deal versus Remain, excluding any No Deal Brexit. But this would surely be a non-starter. The Electoral Commission would say that such gerrymandering of the franchise excludes too many voters. According to YouGov, more voters are in favour of No Deal Brexit than are in favour of Mr Corbyn becoming Prime Minister.The last time Labour got into a mess like this was over the Scottish referendum back in . Tony Blair did a U-turn on devolution announcing that,the Scottish Parliament was really the ldquosettled will of the Scottish people, as the late John Smith believed, then it should be tested in a referendum. The wrangling went on for months. The hapless Shadow Scottish Secretary, George Robertson, was left trying to explain why there would be one, two or possibly three referendums before the settled will could be determined.:Irsquom a Yes voter, but Irsquom now sick and tired of my own sideHowever, that constitutional imbroglio was nothing compared to Brexit. Scottish home rule was never going to determine the outcome of the  General Election because it was of marginal interest to the vast majority of UK voters. Brexit is the central question that will dominate the coming General Election, and probably the ones after it. Parliament has proved unable to address the question properly, let alone find a satisfactory resolution.If Labour had really intended to pivot to Remain it should have done it two years ago when Parliament debated Article . That legislation made Brexit legally binding, and a No Deal Brexit the default. It was the height of irresponsibility for MPs, led by Mr Corbyn, to vote by a massive  majority to authorise Brexit, on a hard timetable, irrespective of the terms of departure. It was, as the SNP argued, a Brexit blank cheque.Mr Corbyn now says he will do ldquowhatever it takes to stop No Deal Brexit. But this is like waiting till the bus is tipping over the clf before trying to do a handbrake turn. Labour could belatedly have prevented a deal-less departure from the EU by supporting Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement, most of which Labour actually agreed with. It chose instead to walk through the ision lobbies with the far-right European Research Group of Tory MPs.Indeed, Labour could have halted hard Brexit on a number of occasions. It refused to endorse a Norway option, Mrs Mayrsquos deal, or a compromise in the last-minute negotiations with the Government. Mr Corbyn chose to dance around the question, seeking a narrow party advantage. It was all tactics and no strategy and played into the hands of one Boris Johnson.My own view is that Mr Corbyn would be rather content now to see a hard Brexit. This is partly because he has always been a Eurosceptic, but mainly because he thinks Labour could capitalise on the chaos thereafter. When your opponents are making a mess of things, donrsquot get in the way.Itrsquos an electoral gambit, but a cynical one and voters may not go along with it. When the history is written of how the UK came to this situation, driven by a band of hard-right Brexiters over the clf, Mr Corbyn may find he is cast as Mr Johnsonrsquos little helper."},{"url":null,"title":"feels-like-emergency-vet","story":"I WAS always around animals as a young child.

Its a moderate hike, but it delivers massive reward, and a sense of being high above it all, while looking down on all the hustle and bustle.Pit stop: Head down the south-east side of the hill for a slap-up pub lunch at The Sheep Heid Inn by Duddingston Loch.VICKY ALLANIONA VIEWED FROM MULLWhat makes it so special  With its famous ancient abbey and its back story as the focal point for the spread of Christianity in Scotland and beyond, nobody needs persuading that the island of Iona is special.The abbey itself is wonderful, of course, but viewing it from Fionnphort, the Mull clachan from where you make the short ferry crossing, is an equally splendid experience.Its partly down to the sense of anticipation ndash as true for ees as it is first-time visitors ndash but its also the sheer drama created by the setting and the endlessly changing Hebridean weather. This traveller has never visited Iona and not seen a rainbow at some point during the visit.Pit stop: Check out The Creel Seafood Bar, a shack in the car park by the ferry slipway which sells delicious crab sandwiches.BARRY DIDCOCKTHE OCHILSWhat makes it so special  Its personal.Summers -. July and August I spent in Northern Ireland, thinking about the girl and willing September on. It came slow. When it did Id jump on a train to Belfast and three morelater, just after Larbert, the land would open out and the Ochils came into view.The sight of them meant I was close to her again. I still get the same thrill when I see them now, more than  years later. And I think of all the constants in my le ndash trains and love and the Ochils ndash and I wish I could have them for  years more.Pit stop: You dont actually have to go the Ochils to enjoy the view butyou do the Cafe des Fleurs, Bridge Street, Dollar, offers great home-made cakes.TEDDY JAMIESONTHE VIEW FROM A MOTORCYCLE HELMET VISORWhat makes it so special  Theres a reason that motorcyclists from all over Europe flock to Scotland ndash and its not for the weather or our sunny dispositions. Its the roads and the views. My favourite is swooping down the A towards Loch Maree in Wester Ross, its dozens of islands sparkling like gems set in the deep blue of the water. A view that is never the same twice, as clouds scud across the sky and cast their shadows like secrets.Pit stop: Its  minutes awaybut The Torridon has a relaxed inn just round the corner from the fancy main hotel, which is ideal for walkers, climbers, cyclists, motorcyclists and other scruffy types. Try the smoked salmon or the steak and ale pie.GARRY SCOTTST ANDREWS FROM THE SCORESWhat makes it so special  Is there a more beautul road than The Scores in St Andrews Starting at the ancient, ruined cathedral, once the headquarters of the Roman Catholic church in Scotland, a walk west along it affords wonderful views of other historical landmarks including St Andrews Castle and the buildings of the countrys oldest university.

The reward is one of the most exhilarating views in Scotland.Standing on ft of granite is always going to give you a good view, but this is one of the best. Bennachie is not highbut what makes the view from the top worth the climb is the fact the countryside all around is so flat and you can see so far.:Scotlands greatest drives: Part :Scotlands greatest drives: Part Look there for the Cairngorms, and there for Lochnagar, and there for Mount Keen and over there is Aberdeen and the cold sea.Pit stop: The Bennachie Visitor Centre ndash which is a good place to start and finish your walk to the top ndash has top coffee and sandwiches.MARK SMITHSOUND OF SLEAT, SKYEWhat makes it so special  The view is ever-changing depending on the weather.Skyes famed Fairy Pools, Quiraing and Old Man of Storr may dazzle, but one of the best views on the island is gazing across the Sound of Sleat towards the mountains of Glenelg, Loch Hourn and the Knoydart peninsula. Ive spent many a happy hour watching golden shards of sunlight dance atop the rippling water or thick veils of dark rain clouds sweep past. Boats flit to-and-fro, fishing vessels and pleasure craft alike, and sometimes you can see the bobbing heads of playful seals.Pit stop: Have a wander round Isleornsay, a village just off the A, where the Hotel Eilean Iarmain serves up hearty bar meals.SUSAN SWARBRICKBINNY CRAIG, NEAR ECCLESMACHAN, WEST LOTHIANWhat makes it so special  If you squint your eyes, it looks like a lions head.I could see Binny Craig from my childhood bedroom and took advantage of its steep slopes for fun-filled afternoons spent sledging on snowy days.It is an impressive example of a \"crag-and-tail\" landform, a legacy from the last ice age, with its \"crag\" of hard rock facing west and sloping \"tail\" of sedimentary rock and fertile farmland to the east. From the top, there are panoramic views across the Firth of Forth to the Ochils as well as surrounding West Lothian and the Pentland Hills.Pit stop: Its less than a -minute drive to the Hideaway Cafe at Beecraigs Country Park.SUSAN SWARBRICKOSSIANS HALL, THE HERMITAGE, PERTHSHIREWhat makes it so special  A thundering waterfall.The woodland trails and riverside walks that form The Hermitage are well-trodden by everyone from Queen Victoria to the poet William Wordsworth and the artistJ M W Turner. Among its gems is Ossians Hall, a folly with sliding , a secret handle and mirrored artwork, that offers dramatic views over the thundering Black Linn Falls. It may not be the highest in Scotland ndash that honour goes to Eas a Chual Aluinn in Assynt, Sutherland ndash but it is certainly photogenic.Pit stop: Pop into nearby Dunkeld where theres a clutch of excellent cafes and bakeries.SUSAN SWARBRICKINEOS REFINERY AT NIGHT, GRANGEMOUTH, FALKIRKWhat makes it so special  It glows like a flaming forest and, one of the biggest refineries of its kind in Europe, is a gigantic, sprawling symbol of our fossil fuel era.There are few views more dazzling than that of the Grangemouth Ineos petrochemical refinery at night, a glaring, savage garden of cooling towers, chimneys and pipes, so luminescent it makes the sky glow red. For lovers of an industrial panorama, its magnicent.Yet in these times of climate emergency, that brilliance is also chilling. Best seen from Polmont ski centre or from across the Forth at Culross, its an icon of our times ndash of industry, the Anthropocene, consumption and need, and also of past optimism.It symbolises jobs, energy, industrial disputes. Its % of the fuel in Scotlands filling stations. But it also feels asit is already, certainly should be in a post-carbon future, something that belongs to the past, even as it belches out its beautul haze of smoke and light.Pit stop: The Abbotsinch pub is the ideal spot for a nearby pint ndash and plate of pub food. Or,youd kill for a square sausage breakfast, try the Rumbling Tum food truck.VICKY ALLANROBIN RIGG WINDFARM FROM SCREEL HILL, DALBEATTIEWhat makes it so special  It was Scotlands first offshore windfarm, those white turbines a symbol of a greener, zero carbon future.The Solway Firth, seen from the ridge of Screel Hill, is a thing of loveliness in itself, and the Cumbrian stretch of the coastline has even been declared an Area Of Outstanding Natural Beauty.Whether you think its enhanced by the elegant flock of  white spindles, that seem posed like tall waders, probably depends on how you feel about wind farms ndash and they are certainly not without controversy.:Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part :Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part Such turbines, however, are now a familiar feature in our Scottish landscape, and set to be still more so. The UK Climate Change committee have said we need to quadruple their number in the UK to help hit emissions targets.Last month saw  turbine Beatrice, an offshore farm twice Robin Riggs size, opened off Caithness. But, as turbine views go, its hard to beat the wonder of Robin Rigg.Pit stop: Refuel on indulgent home-baked cakes down to Treats And Eats tearoom at Colvend.VICKY ALLANGRAVEYARD AT CHURCH OF THE HOLY RUDE, ST JOHN STREET, STIRLINGWhat makes it so special  A walk round Stirlings Old Town is always a pleasant way to while away a couple of hours.Theres the castle, of course, with its long and colourful historyand among the many striking buildings nearby is the Church of the Holy Rude, Stirlings second oldest building after the castle. The infant King James VI was crowned there in .The church has an evocative graveyard, in the middle of which stands a little rise, complete with a bench: and its here, on a clear day particularly, that there are some stunning, uninterrupted views ndash of the castle, rearing up to your right, and below and in front of you, scenic plains and distant hills across Stirlingshire and up to the Trossachs.Its the sort of view you could lose yourself in for ages, and it makes you realise just how visually striking Scotland is. .Pit stop: There are ious cafes and restaurants in the streets nearby.RUSSELL LEADBETTERCULLEN BAY FROM THE OLD RAILWAY BRIDGE.What makes it so special  The view is very deceptive as the road into Cullen offers no clue of the stunning vista below.Driving down the main street, the only view is an old railway bridge until you turn left and the wide sweeping bay opens out before you.The tiled roofs of the brightly-coloured traditional fishing cottages of the sea town roll out ahead of you before the golden sands of the glorious crescent beach. A walk on the beach is a must with a very good chance to spot dolphins along the way.Pit stop: Cullen ice cream shop for arguably the best in Scotland.

Offering fabulous views of the nearby small isles of Rum, Eigg and Muck, the view is best appreciated on a long summer day as the sun dips behind the islands and bathes the sea and the beaches in glorious colours. The islands seem like theyre floating on the still azure waters.Pit stop: Arisaig hotel for langoustinesALAN SIMPSONTAKING OFF FROM EDINBURGH AIRPORTWhat makes it so special  Its one of the most famous sights in Scotland andyou are lucky, and its not rainy, or foggy, or you are on the wrong side of the plane, or the pilot takes a dferent flight path, then youll see the Forth Bridge spanning the mighty firth.From up here, thousands of feet in the air, youll get an unforgettable view of an epic chunk of Victorian steampunk which was voted Scotlands greatest man-made wonder in  and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Beats coming in to Glasgow over the Laighpark sewage works any day.Pit stop: A steward will be along in a moment.GARRY SCOTTVICTORIA STREET, EDINBURGHWhat makes it so special  Victoria Street is more typical of Prague, say, than the Scottish capital but for the tens of thousands of tourists who wander up and down its stately, curvedits an Instagram-tastic collection of kooky shops and beguiling, eye-popping perspectives.Although not as old as the Old Town ndash or even the New Town: it was built in the early s and originally named Bow Street ndash its just as venerated. The street itself is best viewed from Victoria Terrace, which overlooks it, or from the Grassmarket, from where you can look up it.:Scotlands  favourite bands: Part :Scotlands  favourite bands: Part Visit on one of Edinburghs Open Street days, during which the city centre is closed to traffic, and you can even avoid the crowded pavement and walk right up the middle without having to dodge taxis.Pit stop: A certain JK Rowling used Victoria Street as the inspiration for Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter novel series.

The UK deficit was just .% of GDP.GERS also showed ldquofiscal transfers within the Union were pound per head to Scotlandrsquos benefit, with public spending pound per head higher than in the UK, despite tax revenue per head lagging pound behind the UK.SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay stressed GERS reflected the current constitutional settlement and did not show how Scotlandrsquos might improve after independence.:Alan Cumming: Scots were duped in However, Prof Gallagher, a former civil servant who advised Better Together in , said GERS did show Scotlandrsquos ldquoinherited expectations and obligations and the service levels voters expected after a Yes vote, even without the taxes to pay for them.He said that, despite the Growth Commission prioritising deficit reduction and prudence, the upshot would be massive government borrowing to fill the hole left by Treasury transfers.Servicing this debt would then lead to spending cuts and austerity, he said, arguing the SNPrsquos case for independence was characterised by ldquodeliberate over-optimism.He also said the Commission failed to offer specic growth policies, failed to cost a new currency arrangement, and failed to cost for trade barriers with the rest of the UK caused by Scotland being in the EU after Brexit.He said: ldquoScotlandrsquos fiscal position, set out in GERS, presents a major challenge for the independence movement.

There is a byelection next Thursday and the SNP are throwing the kitchen sink at it, hoping to inflict a shock defeat on the Liberal Democrats.A third of the SNPrsquos MSPs have visited so far, including Nicola Sturgeonand a good chunk of her cabinet. There have also been MPs, MEPs, councillors and staffers from HQ.Itrsquos a fascinating contest. For this is no ordinary seat. Shetland is, on paper, the toughest target in Scotland.The byelection was triggered by former Scottish LibDem leader Tavish Scott quitting to work for Scottish Rugby.When he won Shetland for the fth time in , he did so with . per cent of the vote. The SNP came second on .%.The Northern Isles have also voted Liberal or LibDem continually since .But while that LibDem majority looks unassailable in percentage terms, you can look at it in other ways too.Shetlandrsquos , electorate is the second smallest in Scotland. Mr Scottrsquos majority - based on a strong personal vote remember - was , in  on a % turnout. By-election turnout is generally a lot smaller than in general elections. If it were  per cent, the theoretical majority would be nearer ,. That means the SNP could win by persuading  LibDem voters to switch sides.Then therersquos the last election in which Shetland voted. In Mayrsquos European poll, the LibDems came first on .% while the SNP got .%. In terms of votes, the LibDems got  and the SNP , a dference of just . Turnout was %.The big dference with  was the presence of the Brexit Party, which got  votes, or .%, in May. The Brexit Party arenrsquot standing on Thursday, although the husk of Ukip are.If a lot of Leavers stay home, put off by a two-horse race between Remainers, the fight between the SNP and LibDems becomes a real one. The fewer the votes in play, the bigger the scope for an upset.:Scotland in Union funds sink to record lowOrkney MP Alistair Carmichael this week sounded the alarm, urging Labour and Tory supporters to back the LibDems. ldquoIf we split the anti-independence vote by voting for other parties or independents, then it is possible the SNP could win this seat, he said.ldquoThere is a reason why, having not set foot in Shetland for three years, the First Minister has now visited three times in one month.Of course, scare tactics to mobilise your vote are standard for elections. But other LibDems say similar things in private. ldquoItrsquoll be close, they frown.There is another factor that can help the SNP. Money. At national elections, candidate spending limits are based on the size of the electorate. In Shetland, the maximum allowed by law in  was pound, over five months. But the spending limit in byelections is a standard pound, that can be spent in five weeks.That kind of money - which the SNP has and the Scottish LibDems donrsquot - lets the SNP blitz every corner of the islands.Motivation is also with the SNP. Winning Shetland would show the party can win anywhere. It would burst Jo Swinsonrsquos bubble. Fighting it hard forces the LibDems to spend cash theyrsquod rather not, drawing in subsidies from the UK party earmarked for the general election.If the LibDems lose, they also lose their seat on Holyroodrsquos business bureau, which deals with chamber and committee work, as membership requires five MSPs.So should we all wait up to the small hours on Friday to catch some Holyrood history  I wouldnrsquot put the cocoa on yet.The SNP is still the under-dog, and it sounds it. ldquoLend me your vote, pleaded candidate Tom Wills this week. Hersquos ldquoasking for just  months until the next election, the First Minister added.The SNPrsquos main message has also been incoherent, hyperbolic nonsense. Unable to play the Remain card against the LibDems, it has tried to make the vote about the Prime Minister. Despite Shetland voting .% Remain in , Ms Sturgeon and Mr Wills are promoting guff about a vote for the SNP sending ldquoa strong message to Boris Johnson that Shetland wonrsquot stand for Brexit.Picture the scene in Downing Street. ldquoIrsquom sorry, Prime Minister, but yoursquove been sent a strong message. Remain voters in a Remain seat in a Remain country have swapped one Remain party for another in a Remain parliament. Nothing in Westminster has changed one jot. However, just to be on the safe side...The SNP sounds like a party trying to talk furiously about national issues because itrsquos running scared of its record on the ground after  years in power.ldquoI know therersquos more work to do to improve local ferry services, says Mr Wills of a key issue. He promises a ldquobrighter futurehe wins. Brighter future is code for an inadequate present.:Shetland byelection turns ugly as SNP graffiti sprayed on war memorialIn contrast, LibDem Beatrice Wishart has focused throughout on local issues like ferry costs, poor broadband, farming, schools and the NHS, putting the blame squarely on the SNP for all shortcomings.As one SNP hand puts it: ldquoThe LibDems are not as toxic as they were. The Brexit thing is not going to work for us up there because theyrsquore as anti-Brexit as we are. Wersquore also getting to the stage where people must feel tired of having their doors banged every night of the week.However byelections do throw up surprises, andthe SNP win, there is an intriguing consequence. It would tie the votes in parliament. There would be  in the Nationalist corner and  for all other parties. The Government could avoid embarrassing defeats. It would not have to watch its laws being repealed again by a united opposition, as happened with the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act.It would also put Ms Sturgeon achingly close to an absolute majority. Another byelection or a defection and she could claim a stronger mandate for Indyref.Well, almost. Only  of those  votes would come from SNP MSPs. The other would rely on Mark McDonald, the former minister who quit in a sleazy text scandal. He currently represents his Aberdeenshire seat as an Independent, but normally votes with his old party.If the SNP win Shetland, his vote would become more valuable to ministers and so give him more leverage. Perhaps, after his two-year penance, the SNP might like to readmit him, for instance  He was never expelled after all, but resigned.If the SNP pull off an upset in Shetland, it would indeed mean a brighter future. Just not for the islanders or the rookie sent south for ldquojust  months on probation.

The firm has enlisted the services of Matthew Black, previously a senior energy adviser at the Stirlingshire-based Fintry Development Trust, specialising in reducing carbon emissions and enhancing sustainability.Mr Black said: ldquoShared ground loop arrays are the most effective solution for delivering Scotlandrsquos ambitions for the decarbonisation of heat. Along with the right policy changes in Scotland, we can make signicant progress towards Scotlandrsquos  net-zero carbon target and beyond.ldquoThe race to decarbonise electricity in Scotland has made considerable progress.

How reasonable, though, is it to compare Scotlandwith other fully sovereign countries where in Europe, when we control at most,  per cent of our own affairs, always within the context of Westminster policy, and the remainder is determined in Westminster  Is it not to compare sovereignty with devolution, which, of course, are quite dferent things She then goes on to ask: ldquoHow could we possibly hold a referendum in an atmosphere where factual evidence is so denied by activists on one side  It is clear that the fault, in her view, lies with the Scottish Government. Yet, Westminster can tell us ndash almost to the penny ndash what Scottish spending is, but most of the tax revenue side of GERS is a matter of estimation as the necessary data is not collected. One might ask, why not  After all, most large companies today have pretty detailed sales and costs at regional level, and in many cases right down to inidual establishments, often in real time. Why is this not being acted on Perhaps, the purpose is less to shine a light on economic reality, but remains similar to when Ian Lang, then Secretary of State for Scotland, wrote in a memorandum to John Major when GERS was first published in , ldquoI judge that [GERS] is just what is needed at present in our campaign to maintain the initiative and undermine the other parties. This initiative could score against all of them Lastly, it is clear from published data that deficit is a common feature of most UK regions. An examination of data on almost any measure of economic or financial performance would show London is iniably ahead, often signicantly, of any other region in the UK.There are two ways we can consider this. One is that London is the \"goose that lays the golden eggs\" and we should all be grateful. As Boris Johnson said in : \"A pound spent in Croydon is far more of value to the country than a pound spent in Strathclyde.\"The other is that it clearly indicates an unbalanced and dysal economy, London as the ldquogiant suction machine, hoovering up resources in the UK, as Vince Cable pointed out. Or, as Stephanie Flanders wrote in , without London the UK economy would be very dferent, less focused on financial services and more on manufacturing, and policy changed to suit.In short, we should ask how far the deficit reported by GERSindicates weaknesses in the Scottish economy, and how much it reflects policies at Westminster dominated by economic and social needs where Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WHAT do the Gers figures actually do  Surely all they suggest is that Scotland, with more natural resources per head than any other country, is trapped in a UK economic nightmare. Or do they just tell us that  years of a union has reduced Scotland to a cap-in-hand beggar nation In fact they are an insult. Scotland with nine per cent of the UKrsquos population, they suggest, is responsible for more than  per cent of the UKrsquos debt   Which intelligent person could believe this rubbish What is the case is that lots of wealth generated in Scotland is in fact registered in London so it appears on Londonrsquos balance sheet. And Scotland is then apportioned a share of lots of ldquonational expenditure which has nothing whatever to do with us ndash like funding Trident, building aircraft carriers, paying for the House of Lords, invading the Middle East, paying billions annually for the interest on the UKrsquos pound,,,,-plus national debt and so much more.There is no point in even debating these GERS figures. They are irrelevant. They bear no relationship whatsoever to any economic situation an independent Scotland would work with.GERS is Scotlandrsquos UK deficit.Dave McEwan Hill, Sandbank, Argyll.THE phrase ldquolies, damned lies and statistics came to mind when I saw the dferent reactions to the GERS Report. The report showed total public spending of pound. billion but total revenue, including a geographical share of North Sea oil, of pound.bn leaving a shortfall of pound.bn representing seven per cent of Gross Domestic Product .You today had a picture of a triumphant Finance Secretary highlighting the positive fact that the deficit had decreased to seven per cent from .% of GDP in   indicating that ldquoScotlandrsquos economy and public finances are strong and that ldquoour future will be far brighter as an independent member of the EU, dismissing the overall deficit ldquoas not where we would want it to be.Other commentators looking at exactly the same statistics were not so sanguine about the health of Scotlandrsquos economy, pointing out thatan independent Scotland wished to join the EU the deficit would have to be reduced to three per cent of GDP, meaning cuts to public services or tax increases.Derek Mackay sees the positives in the report but others see the negatives and in particular the deficit of pound.bn.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadets viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : pmCOMPETITION: The Orcadian has teamed up with Highland Park to offer readers the chance to win a limited edition bottling of Highland Park’s Orkney Rowing Club.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period.

A refurbished and extended museum is expected to re-open during the summer of .Council leader James Stockan said: “This is a project of tremendous signicance for Hoy and for Orkney as a whole.“It has taken longer than we first hoped to get to this stage and it will be excellent for all involved to see work getting underway soon.“I am delighted that, like the council, the project’s external funders remain fully committed to the scheme.“When complete, the restored and extended museum will for the first time in many years open all year round, encouraging more people to visit Hoy and boosting tourism throughout the island.”The museum’s role is to chart Orkney’s military involvement in the First and Second World Wars and provide a safe home for a major collection of wartime artefacts, many of national and international importance.After a competitive tendering exercise, the contract for the work has been awarded to Orkney BuildersLtd.A temporary exhibition on the wartime history of Scapa Flow is on show at the Hoy Hotel while the museum is closed. This has been part-funded through the Island of Hoy Development Trust.Repairs to the Romney Hut at Lyness and options for the Oil Tank will be considered at a later date.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Been to see anything at the Festival  The most commonly asked question in August has become the Edinburgh-centric version of your hairdresser, barber or personal stylist asking“you’re going anywhere nice for your holidays ” Perhaps you’ve caught the latest up-and-coming comedian, a play covering the stigma of mental health – or you’ve just taken a bijou stroll along Princes Street and are wondering where the gentle sound of Peruvian pan pipers playing the Simon  Garfunkel classic El Condor Pasa has gone. Maybe by chance you’ve stumbled on to Charlotte Square where the Pink Chino Massive hang out during the month of August, keeping a hungry lookout for stragglers from the Yellow Cords Brigade. If that be the case then there’s a small chance that you may have caught a glimpse of a current or former politician in the New York Times Theatre. Forget Jerry Sadowitz and his inappropriate jokes, the real comedians and magicians are in the West End. Take your pick from a basketconsisting of our very own First Minister Nicola Sturgeon who has appeared at this year’s Festival on four occasions, former unelected PM Gordon Broon, reality TV star Kezia Dugdale, Ruth Davidson from Celebrity Bake Off and a cameo appearance from a guy who was either Corbyn’s best mate John McDonnell or that actor Larry Lamb who once played Archie Mitchell in Eastenders. Oor Nicola, who never travels anywhere without her well thumbed copy of Sunset Song, has been interviewed by football journalist Graham Spiers presumably about whether the Gerscan mount a serious title challenge this season.She’s also spoken to political comedian Matt Forde, radio host Iain Dale and in true poacher turned gamekeeper style interviewed the author Arundhati Roy.Nicola, also took time off from the day job, to address one of the big issues of our time, namely should Miley Cyrus and husband Liam Hemsworth “git back thegither” on hard-hitting political programme Loose Women. I’m hoping to catch her Marti Pellow tribute act at the Pleasance tomorrow. Meanwhile, Broon took a break from doing the big shop in Cowdenbeath to interview leading economist Branko Milanovic in a discussion labelled Capital And Our Political Crisis. The Royal Bank of Scotland event, yip that lot, saw the former Chancellor chew the fat with the economics guy, who was on a mission to find out “what caused the current crisis of trust in politics” touching on the financial crash of . I don’t knowBranko found the answer to this existenstial quandry orhe realised a hefty chunk of it was sitting across from him – as the show was a sell out and I couldn’t get a brief.Next up for Broon is another sold-out event on Monday –what is wrong with these people  – under the imaginative title - Scotland, Britain and Europe. This is the one where Gordon invites the audience to join him in a giant conga round Charlotte Square before doing Oops Upside Your Head on the grass... only.Nope, that’ll be as he “examines the place of Scotland in the UK and Europe in an age of fracturing globalisation, the rise of political populism and the challenges around understanding of national identity”. Gie’s peace. However, I am looking forward to the show where he describes how he bottled calling a general election in  and voted for, then provided the funding, for the Iraq War that led to hundred of thousands of civilian deaths – maybe next year, maybe not. Anyway, all of this political, side hustle shenanigans, and scrambling to rewrite legaciesgot me to thinking that being a poitician be it a MP or an MSP is their actual job.Not a licence to print money or tee-up your next gig should the electorate fancy a change. A real job doing things like making sure the hospitals are safe and not breaching your own waiting time targets for AE a whopping , times in the year up to August. Fixing stuff, mending things and looking after us that’s what these folk are meant to do. I compare this to the engineer who came to my house this morning to fix the in-built oven. He took  minutes and headed off to another job down the road leaving me match-fit as the roast tattie season draws near. To my knowledge, he doesn’t give interviews telling of the abuse he receives on Twitter when he can’t fix someone’s fridge and he hasn’t had time yet to pen his memoirs - not when there are white goods in need of urgent repair. It used to be that history judged a politician’s legacy but now they’re all busy trying to control public perception while they’re still alive and in some cases not even reached . Contrast politicians of today with someone like Clement Attlee who led the Labour Party from - and served in a wartime coalition government under Winston Churchill. He had that old-fashioned thing that very few people now possess, a sense of duty. Last year it emerged that Attlee and his we Violet had sponsored a Jewish mother and her two children, helping them to leave Germany in  and move to the UK. The Attlees took in a ten-year-old boy called Paul Willer who stayed with them for four months until the beginning of the Second World War.We only know about this because a -year-old Paul Willer revealed it in a newspaper interview last November.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

Parishioners then enter into the rotunda or principal porch with its high, vaulting ceiling and polished stone on floor and walls. There is access on the two sides to a repository and a staircase for the choir leading up to the gallery. The sheer scale and massing of the entrance porch sets a hallowed tone for the Church into which it directly leads.Parish Priest, Canon Liam Stevenson, spoke of the pride and joy felt by everyone for their beautul new Church.\"As a building it is truly awe inspiring and surely must be seen as an architectural gem,\" he explained.\"Next Sunday, in joyous celebration, we will gather together as a community to solemnly dedicate the Church as a House of God and fitting place of worship for many, many generations of families in the town and surrounding district.\"A house becomes a home when a family lives and grows in love within its walls. Just so, next Sunday the Church of Saint Thrse will become the spiritual home of a Christian people coming together to give thanks and to worship God and to dedicate themselves as a family community blessed by His all-embracing love and mercy.\"Canon Stevenson also spoke of his personal joy at the messages of support and goodwill, which have come from right across the Christian community locally and much farther afield. He was greatly encouraged and thankful for all of this and is looking forward to welcoming Bishop John McAreavey, the clergy of the diocese and many representatives of other denominations to join in celebration at the ceremony on next Sunday afternoon.Architecturally, the building is circular in shape with five annexes housing the imposing main entrance, a side-chapel, the Sanctuary and two side entrances. This design was chosen because of the wedge-shaped site and, also, it provides for a much better congregational area. The Church dominates the large site, which also houses the parish centre and parochial house.A cloistered walkway to the left and right facilitates access for the congregation and the centre aisle leads directly to the Sanctuary. The Altar and all its furnishings are crafted from Portuguese marble and the central focus of the whole building – The Tabernacle – is framed with radiant, jewelled stained glass.Secondary access to the Church is gained from both the Scarva Road side and from the main car park. These lead directly to the cloistered walks and the seating area, which has a huge capacity. The curved seats are fashioned in bespoke American white oak and radiate out from the Sanctuary all the way back to the main entrance. Around the walls there are beautul stained glass windows which depict the seven Sacraments and an eighth one which was specially commissioned to reflect special features of the town of Banbridge: these include graphic pictorial references to Saint Patricks Church in Dromore Street, The Cut under Jinglers Bridge, the River Bann and, finally, a sheaf of flax to reflect the industrial heritage of the town.Natural light and ventilation is provided for the interior at a higher level and one of the special architectural features is the spectacular halo-effect roof-light high up in the vaulted ceiling. Interestingly too, the Stations of the Cross around the walls of the cloister are those which hung in the old Church and which have been beautully restored to pristine condition by the architect himself, Mr Brendan Laverty.SRC raise over £, for nominated charities Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Finally, there is a suite of rooms, which houses the priests sacristy and a flower-preparation room.

Whether it’s further education or the world of employment, the important thing is not to panic. There are loads of options available and, as McDonald’s Westwood’s Business Manager Katie McManus can attest, an unexpected road can often be the best one.The -year-old began working in McDonald’s in Glengormley while studying for her A-levels. Aged , Katie had plans of going to University and becoming a Mental Health Nurse, but completely changed direction following her time at the fast food restaurant. “I decided not to go to university and to take a gap year after my exams,” she explained.“I went Crew Member to Sht Manager and then realised that’s what I wanted to do. I got promoted the whole way through to Business Manager. “Personally, I wouldn’t advise anyone to go to university until they know what they want to do. There’s no point wasting the time and money doing it. I would encourage people who are maybe panicking about grades not to worry. There are dferent things out there, and you’re not always taught that in school or given all the options. I never thought I would be working in McDonald’s but the option found me.”She continued: “It’s not what people would assume – it’s very business orientated for me. You’re very driven to work towards targets and it’s competitive. The teamwork and morale is amazing too, you literally feel like you’re with your family away from home.”As well as offering a career, McDonald’s also offers a range of educational and professional development courses to help employees attain everything from GCSE’s to university degree.“There are so many opportunities,” Katie said. “You can constantly get promoted towards Business Manager and then after that you have options to become a franchiser one day, which is a big opportunity butyou really want it you can push for it. “We have people at the minute studying for the GCSEs through our apprenticeship programmes, so they’re getting their Maths and English qualications, which will help them in the future le. Because I didn’t go to university, the option is there for me to do a business degree, which I’m planning on doing next year, so I didn’t miss out on that.”She continued: “I was quite anxious and nervous about making the decision not to go to university. It’s hard to knowyou’re making the right decision at that age. “Looking back, I’m glad it turned out that way. I would say to some of the young ones in here not to panic. Everything happens for a reason and you don’t know what path you’re going to go down until you go down it. GCSE’s and other exams are important, but there are other avenues that you can go down to get dferent jobs.”She added: “McDonald’s don’t really on experience and what you have in your qualications – it’s all about your attitude, your attitude to doing well and how hard you work. “If you are hard working and they really want to make something ofyourself then you should come here.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glasmullin green standoff continues into second day","story":"PROTESTORS have ed to Glassmullin Green amid a stand off over plans by De La Salle College to build a new sports facility on the site.Work was due to begin the £.million project yesterday, but campaigners moved on to the green in a bid to block the development.Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds left the site yesterday following an intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the space since .Residents resumed their protest this morning.Aithne Kerrigan from FOGOG has accused De La Salle College of acting “in bad faith from the outset”.“They have said that they have tried to engage with residents – they haven’t,” she said.“They held an open night at the start of April and they only managed to get seven people across their doors, four of which were definitely objectors. They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":null,"title":"alternative arrangements to brexit backstop can ensure no hard border insists dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We are continuing to work with the Government to reach a sensible deal as we exit the EU.\"It is time for the Irish Government to recognise the impact of no-deal on its access to the GB market and encourage the EU negotiators to take a more progressive and constructive approach in negotiations.\"She called on the Ulster Farmers Union to use its position on the all-Ireland Brexit forum to press Dublin to \"take a more reasonable approach\".Mr Aiken noted that the past week had seen \"a repeat of every single argument in favour of and against the backstop\".He said: \"I and other unionists oppose the backstop because it undermines the Belfast Agreement and bypasses the principle of consent. Others within nationalism have a dferent view.\"The bottom line is that as long as this stand-off continues, we edge closer to a no-deal Brexit.\"There is only one way to solve this and thats to get into negotiations behind closed doors.\"Sinn Fein yesterday insisted there was no alternative to the backstop. \"The Irish backstop is a key part of the withdrawal agreement agreed between the British Government and the EU,\" a party spokesperson said.\"Boris Johnson voted in favour of this agreement and the backstop it contains. The EU have repeatedly made it clear that the backstop is not open for renegotiation.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: \"The search for so-called alternative arrangements is like a quest for fools gold.\"This is a distraction from the Government facing up to the real choices. The only way a hard border can be avoided is through sufficient regulatory and customs alignment.\"TUV leader Jim Allister said: \"The EU claim that unless the UK signs up to the backstop to avoid a border they will impose a border. That is a totally illogical position. The UK has said it will not impose a border. Dublin says it will not impose a border. Who is going to build this border \"Meanwhile, a Tory MP has claimed a solution has already been found to solve the backstop problem.Greg Hands, co-chair of the think-tank Prosperity UKs Alternative Arrangements Commission, said it has drawn up a series of \"administrative and technological measures\" which negated the need for a backstop.Writing in the Daily Mail, he said the proposals include a tiered \"trusted trader\" scheme, similar to that used between the US and Canada, which would \"cut down paperwork and avoid routine customs checks\" at the border.The commission also recommended carrying out checks on food and animals away from the border and \"enhanced economic zones\" straddling the border between Londonderry and Donegal and Newry and Dundalk, with \"tax breaks\" and a \"free trade zone\" to avoid duties on goods.However, Mr Hands admitted that the arrangements could not be set up in time for the current October  exit date and would take up to three years to deploy."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38415041.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/poll.jpg","title":"brexit poll saying majority backs irish sea border rejected by dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"banbridge academy mum owes me 100 for my a","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Beyond the Battlefield looks after the well-being of the ex-service community in both parts of the island of Ireland who suffer with a iety of symptoms and problems related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder .The four walkers hope to finish in Newtownards on Monday afternoon where they will lay wreaths at the Cenotaph in memory of fallen comrades. The -mile walk is being led by Eric Larkin, who served in the Light Infantry, alongside Dave Wilman , Mick Atkinson and Sean Pieres . This is the second year that the veterans have taken on the challenge after walking from Edinburgh to Carrickfergus on the same weekend last year.They are being accompanied by Erics partner Carol who drives a minibus to ensure the walkers are fed, watered and blister free during their trek.The veterans are due to arrive at Stormont on Monday morning where they will be joined by other past and present military members on the last stretch of their walk to Newtownards. Eric said: \"As a veterans charity, Beyond the Battlefield doesnt charge for any service it carries out for its members and relies completely on grants, donations and fundraising activities. \"Beyond the Battlefield helps with things like grants, housing, PTSD, which we have all suffered from, and much more. \"I feel that this is a great cause and Northern Ireland veterans are basically being forgotten about due to the British Armed Forces Covenant not being honoured here,\" he added. The military covenant represents Britains duty of care to its armed forces, infor the sacrices made in the line of duty. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government enshrined the covenant in law for the first time in November , requiring the Defence Secretary to make an annual statement on what is being done to support the armed forces.

That sounds magic to me. The department maintains links with festivals which offer performance production opportunities including Stendhal and Celtronic. Students also participate annually in BBC introducingas well as ious shows and gigs throughout the year in venues around town culminating in the MAPA showcase which includes live performances of both music and dance as well as recorded pieces. “The space is versatile and state of the art”  Grainne  tells me “the theatre can adapt to accommodate band, theatre and dance performances, there are sound-proofed practice rooms, two recording studios and three computer suites of Mac computers with up-to-date software” which conjures up the image of the perfect environment to satisfy the most creative of minds out there.

Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity.

Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear. When the little elephant rockers were broken, the council just came and took them away but they werenrsquot replaced.She said that the play arearsquos summer seats were only replaced on one occasion after local vandals burnt them and had have not been replaced for years.Mrs Jess said that the community has done its best to keep the play park safe by sweeping away any broken glass and rubbish and have raised money for equipment in the past.The play facility caters for a large numbers of families at Millbank Grove Windmill Gardens, Windmill Drive, Windmill View, Carlisle Park and further afield, added Mrs Jess.Cllr Andrews said that he welcomed the residentsrsquo invitation to come along and to find out about the play facility.He said: ldquoThe play facility at Hillfoot Crescent serves a big catchment area with new developments being built in recent years.ldquoI was very impressed by the excellent turnout of parents, neighbours and children to convey their frustrations, worries and concerns about the condition of the existing playground here and the sense of being forgotten about.ldquoThey are calling for an upgrade to state of the art play parks that others in the Rowallane District Electoral Areahave been supplied with in recent times.ldquoI was able to tell them that Hillfoot Crescent is included in the line-up for an upgrade to new state of the art equipment.ldquoI will be lobbying and supporting this call at council level for this much-needed new play park to go ahead speedily along with those for Darragh Cross and Kilmore.The councillor said the council will encourage local residents and children to have their say and input into the new playground.He was presented with a heart-felt plea from the children for their park to be improved which was written as a poem and presented to him.It read: ldquoOur park is dying, itrsquos so sad, No one cares that it looks so bad.A lick of paint a bench or two, A modern slide area all overdue, So come on Council what do you say  Help us out and let us play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to clean up Mary Street area of Crossgar  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a clean-up of the Mary Street area in Crossgar.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews have highlighted the need for the work to be carried out following a recent visit to the village.Mr McGrath mdash who was in Crossgar along with Cllr Andrews to listen to residentsrsquo concerns mdash is keen to see a resolution to the issues in Mary Street.ldquoPaths at this part of the village have become very poorly neglected and a dumping ground for some, the MLA explained.ldquoThis is totally unacceptable at a location adjacent to residentsrsquo garages and homes and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Mr McGrath suggested that the Mary Street problems are indicative of a wider issue people and groups across the country are going to have to get to grips with mdash determining who is responsible for certain pockets of land.He continued: ldquoBy the time it takes to actually determine ownership of areas, the issue could have been sorted multiple times over.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Within hours, the three Belfast brothers were back in Newcastle harbour where anxious relatives awaited news of their ordeal.Philip Sharp and his brothers Johnand Markhad left Minerstown Park Caravan Site wearing only trousers, pullovers and with only two lejackets between them. They started to fish about  yards offshore, but it was when they decided tohome that they hit trouble.They struggled to make any headway against the strong outgoing tide. ldquoWe just drted further and further away until the shore was just a haze, Philip said.They did not realise, as they drted six miles out to sea, that the alarm had been raised and the Newcastle leboat was on its way to their rescue, along with the helicopter..ldquoThe helicopter circled over us until the leboat came, Philip continued. ldquoThey took us on board and gave us hot soup and a tot of rum.ldquoI donrsquot think we have ever been so glad to see anyone in our lives. Altogether we were six hours at sea.The incident earned the boys a sharp rebuke from a Coastguard spokesman, who said they had a lucky escape, and from Earl Roden, secretary of Newcastle leboat station, who has prepared a report for the RNLI.SAINTFIELD mdash Eighty workers at the McCleery and LrsquoAmie factory in Saintfield are to be laid off in October.

He fired one shot straight at the lsquokeeper, one went wide and a cross which narrowly evaded everyone in the box.Killyleagh did prove menacing and in the th minute nice link up play between Charlie Holland and Darren McConnell allowed him to release Jamie Sharvin, but he hot straight at lsquokeeper, Mark Hynes.Thomas Healy was next up for the Whites in the th minute. John Murray won possession on the half way line and drove through midfield, linking with Neale, who released Healy on a one-on-one with Hynes, but the stopper stayed upright to deny him.Rosario were happy to let the YC play in front of them and hit on the counter and their best chance in the first half fell to Conor Murray after some clever link up play with Michael Johnson.

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles. Planners also insist the application does not represent a change of use to the site.The papers continue: ldquoThe application proposes to relocate staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.ldquoThe proposal will not impact any more signicantly in terms of residential amenity as to what is already there at present.Planning Committee members will also be told today that as part of the sale of council land at the Strangford Road to the Education Authority that there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm, with planners explaining this clause was ed into the contract of sale with the Education Authority on the grounds of child safety to ensure students could not be injured by council vehicles.In addition, planners say it is anticipated that most council HGVs and bin lorries will be off site by .am, but that a few may not be, requiring the need for an access through the site to the Strangford Road.

It would be great to borrow that and put it on display in Belfast.”One of the many fascinating exhibits will be the keys from the infamous Nazi prison of Coldtiz Castle, which were taken by a member of one of the unit’s formative regiments when he was freed in WWII.The museum will also commemorate the history the Ulster Defence Regiment , which was founded in  and merged with the Royal Irish Rangers to form the Royal Irish Regiment in .

We don’t care frankly, we just love having people join from any part of the island of Ireland.”Antecedent regiments served at Waterloo, the Battle of the Somme and Normandy. in  the regiment was

Maybe that#s something to do with his passion for photography and an instinct for knowing that the most tellingly accurate shot is never the most obvious one. Anyway, this is the best book that O#Doherty has written.I’m not even sure I would describe the book as history. It is a memoir, the personal reflections of someone old enough – he was  in  – to remember the start of the conflict and yet curious enough to want to know what was going on around him when so many others were putting their heads down, or just accepting the narratives presented from within their own tribe. He retains that curiosity. He also retains a dislike for one-sided, blinkered interpretations the sort of interpretations which ignore the flaws on your own side of the fence, while contentedly blaming ‘themuns’ for everything. In a piece to accompany the publication of the book, he wrote: ‘My book seeks to be a corrective to our history which gives too much signicance to people who did harm and ignored those who made such a dference that now even the political offsprings of the paramilitaries have had to adopt the agendas of gay rights and abortion law reform.’ The Troubles isn’t just a stand-alone event. It isn’t just one story, either. It is the story of everyone of us who lived through it . It is thousands, hundreds-of-thousands of stories, each one from a slightly dferent perspective and each one as important and valid as all the others.O’Doherty is right to say that the stories we hear most are those of iniduals and organisations who want to present themselves as victors of some sort or, at the very least, as justied in what they did. These are the voices and narratives which have tended to drown out the work of those who never lted a gun or planted a bomb, yet whose crucially important work can now be seen in what might be described as a post-conflict revolution which actually began years before the Good Friday Agreement..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button As he notes: ‘The issues on which people are campaigning are more concerned with human rights than with civil rights, with the right of the inidual to identy by orientation or gender or nationality. These issues are less about the relationship between the citizen and the state, as in , and more about the citizen’s sense of self and entitlement to relate to others. The causes are more secular and liberal, though there are counter-causes too, which would put us into a more conservative and religious polity...We still have a ided society that seems to want to ide wider issues between the sectarian factions. So unionists now oppose abortion, same-sex marriage and support Israel while nationalists, broadly speaking, support abortion, same-sex marriage and Palestine.’Personally, I think he’s wrong on the latter point. Increasing numbers of unionists, particularly younger ones, seem comfortable with same-sex marriage and abortion reform and I think the DUP will sht on those issues fairly soon. Stupidly, though, elements of unionism got it into their heads that those issues were, somehow, Sinn Fein demands which is why there was is a reluctance to embrace them as part of a perfectly sensible strategy of equality of citizenship across the entire UK. But I do accept his broader point about the continuing tendency to ide certain issues between the sectarian factions. I was particularly struck by an observation about Jamie Bryson and Lyra McKee: ‘She was the same age as Jamie but represented something , a secular liberal trend in society, away from the old ision. There are still young people like Jamie, as passionate as their forebears about the old quarrel, and some like Lyra for whom the past is a curiosity, not a commitment.’ There were people like Jamie and Lyra in the summer of , too. There will probably be people like Jamie and Lyra in . O’Doherty doesn’t opt for a conclusion or firm prediction: he’s canny enough to know that the usual rules of commentary and observation have never applied to Northern Ireland. But running through his book is the oddly optimistic sense that things are never quite what they seem here meaning that anything, at anytime, is possible. Most people do get on with their lives and always have done, with hundreds of micro organisations and mostly unknown iniduals making the sort of dferences-for-the-better that only become obvious years later. Maybe that is the best we can hope for. If so, it strikes me as a much better option than the industrial-scale rewriting of history and opening of old sores that fill the pages of far too many us-and-them histories landing on my desk.Declassied files: We may not check gun forensics, NIO told IRA and loyalistsDeclassied files: Needham tried to dress up border checkpoints for tourists Coremetrics  Coremetrics

But a confidential  note said that improvements had been delayed after the IRA targeted the sites with ‘human bombs’ – where civilians were forced to drive bombs which they were then detonated remotely..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button In a November  meeting with Mr Needham, Lord Brookborough told him that he was “extremely concerned about the delays caused at the ious checkpoints” and the impact on tourism. A note of the meeting by Mr Needham’s private secretary Jenny Pyper said: “He pointed out that from the point of view of the local people as well, these checkpoints were causing considerable delays and...many of the local people had reverted to opening some of the lesser used border roads. This in itself caused problems for the security forces”. Mr Needham said that for some time he had been concerned that “no thought appeared to have been given to how such checkpoints could be made more ‘user-friendly’.”In a June  meeting between Mr Needham, the Army and NIO officials, the minister referred to “the sometimes ‘fearsome’ mode of dress and patrolling of soldiers in Belfast city centre and particularly the practice of standing upright whilst observing from landrovers”.Referring to the visual impact of border checkpoints, he said it was “important not to leave the impression with people visiting Northern Ireland that they were coming to an armed camp”.In a  meeting, Mr Needham said that he wanted a campaign to encourage southern visitors. At that point, he said that , people from Northern Ireland travelled south but only , came in the other direction.America’s top diplomat in Northern Ireland sent the head of the civil service a letter rippling with discontent after he was held up at the border in .US Consul General Douglas Archard’s letter to Sir David Fell has been released among files declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast under the -year rule.The strong letter of complaint was written in April  after Mr Archard was held up for  minutes at the Cloghoge checkpoint near Newry.The US diplomat told the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service that the “inordinate delay” seemed to be “for no good reason”.Alex Kane: Malachi O’Doherty’s new book is remarkable insight into Northern IrelandDeclassied files: Sinn

In what officials described as a “crisp lecture”, the Sinn Féin man told them that “the fundamental point was for the British to withdraw from Ireland, but there would have to be a continuing economic commitment – he suggested the term ‘reparations’ as appropriate – to prevent dislocation and to repair the disadvantages and discrimination caused by British rule.”In another note of the meeting by Jonathan Stephens, a mid-ranking NIO official who took part in the talks but who is now the NIO’s most senior civil servant, he said that the Sinn Féin man had said that Britain, after withdrawing from Northern Ireland, “should subsequently continue its economic subsidy as reparations for the effects of British involvement”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button In the same meeting Martin McGuinness pressed the officials again on the refusal of ministers to meet them. He said they had to avoid the process being seen to be “a charade”.A minute of the meeting said: “Mr McGuinness apologised for putting this point to the government team forcibly. ‘This is not aimed at you personally,’ he said, but to those who send you. Frankly it was quite ludicrous that after each of the meetings he himself went out and talked to the press outside Parliament Buildings and was followed some time later by Michael Ancram commenting on a meeting he had not been at.”Mr McGuinness emerges from the minutes as the central Sinn Féin figure who could be truculent and aggressive one moment, then humorous and polite the next.Declassied

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

has joined forces with Councils in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of .

Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing.
