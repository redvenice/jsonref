She had a considerable reputation as a photographer but, in the years to come, it seems to me, we will cherish her still more warmly and regard her work even more highly. The black-and-white pictures from the 1930s and 40s – kids playing in the streets, old people keeping a watchful eye on the neighbourhood – have a lyrical grace and a rough-and-tumble tenderness. The kids are having a lot of fun – even if that fun involves someone getting hurt – and it’s fun looking at the pictures. They’re easy on the eye in the way that Anna Karenina is easy to read compared with Ulysses. Henri Cartier-Bresson was a decisive influence but Levitt seemed happy to survey the flow of life casually going about its unruly business rather than pouncing on instants of suddenly perfect visual geometry. Her photographic moments, as a result, contain entire childhoods, whole lifetimes of everyday disappointment and routine happiness: the kind of stuff we associate with narrative fiction rather than photographs.In the 1950s she began shooting in colour – not as a formal experiment but as a natural extension of the urge James Agee had observed in the earlier black-and-white work: “to perceive the aesthetic reality within the existing world”. When almost all of this colour work was stolen by a burglar she started afresh in 1971.This picture is part of a retrospective of Levitt’s work now on show at Arles photography festival. I like fondly to think that Levitt had photographed the lady in the marbled blue dress on the left before, Seven Up!-style, caught in a similar gesture of playful triumph – now that she’s old it might just be backache – when they were both young, in the 1930s. But the other woman, on the right, haven’t I seen her before too, at exactly the age she is now, looking on with that same attitude of rough-hewn, nosy resignation, in black-and-white pictures from before the war? There is, in other words, something timely and eternal about Levitt. So while her city has changed, has become, in many ways, a playground for the young and affluent, this picture also depicts a distinctively 21st-century scenario: Airbnb guests, with all their luggage, wondering when their host is going to show up. Help is, as they say, at hand it’s just that no one knows what form it might take.• Helen Levitt: Observing New York’s Streets is at Espace Van Gogh, Arles photography festival, until 22 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17e1bbfae1e5c637b33a576c3b6844bc3fc09ad7/0_286_4285_2570/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc8458700bc997a36bb7ded0330d935","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The running of the bulls in Pamplona, Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon, the earthquake in California and the Tour de France – the last seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8560c19317000c88794e06c4f88bd6492e05428c/0_0_1715_2000/master/1715.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8296bd5c8e45c6d8906ff7f10270a126","title":"boeing 737 max ordered by ryanair undergoes name change","story":"Decision fuels speculation that troubled plane will be rebranded once it is given all clear to flyA Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair has had the name Max dropped from the livery, further fuelling speculation that the manufacturer and airlines will seek to rebrand the troubled plane once it is given the all clear to fly again.Photos have emerged of a 737 Max in Ryanair colours outside Boeing’s manufacturing hub, with the designation 737-8200 – instead of 737 Max – on the nose. The 737-8200 is a type name for the aircraft that is used by aviation agencies.The Max aircraft remains grounded worldwide after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed a total of 346 people. Boeing has yet to convince regulators that software modifications are sufficient to ensure the plane’s safety.Ryanair has 135 of the 737 Max models on order, the first five of which are due for delivery in the autumn, once regulators have declared the plane safe. The airline’s fleet order is comprised entirely of a larger version of the Max 8, with 197 seats, which it has until now referred to in official Ryanair announcements as the 737 Max 200.Neither Ryanair nor Boeing has commented on nor confirmed the substitution of the 737-8200 for the better known Max, as seen on the photographs taken at Renton in Washington, US, and posted on social media by Woodys Aeroimages. In previous photos from the same source, new Ryanair 737 Max 200 planes from Boeing are shown with 737 Max on their noses.It is understood that what is painted on the plane is a matter for the airline rather than the manufacturer. According to sources reported in the Wall Street Journal, the Max plane is unlikely to return to the skies before 2020.Ryanair would not be the first airline to use a different formulation in referring to the plane. International Airlines Group, which owns carriers including British Airways and Aer Lingus, was equally coy when purchasing discounted Max planes from Boeing last month. Announcing the letter of intent signed at the Paris airshow, IAG referred to “200 B737 aircraft” that would join its fleet from 2023, which it described as “a mix of 737-8 and 737-10 aircraft”.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp e into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane\u0027s black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFlight ET302 crashes approximately six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it is recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.Plenty of observers – among them Donald Trump – have advised Boeing to rebrand the plane before its eventual return to service. The US president tweeted in April: “If I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, \u0026amp REBRAND the plane with a new name.”Boeing told reporters at the Paris show that it would consider changing the name to help the model return to the skies, although the company said it was not working on a name change in its most recent statement on the matter: “We remain open-minded to all input from customers and other stakeholders but have no plans at this time to change the name of the 737 Max.”The Max is Boeing’s top-selling aircraft, with about 5,000 ordered, although deliveries have ceased since the grounding in April and IAG’s is the only significant – and provisional – order.Investigations into the two disasters involving the 737 Max have highlighted the role played by anti-stall software that countermanded pilots’ commands as both planes crashed soon after takeoff. Airlines fear some passengers will refuse to fly on the Max.United Airlines, one of the main operators to date, has drawn up schedules without the 737 Max until November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5add84c3800094d309c203e43c39893c3021da6/0_48_5468_3281/master/5468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f12b4c8ed3f15bea75f8e16b984b116","title":"jaguar land rover offered 500m loan to develop electric cars","story":"Meeting of carmakers also told of plan for new houses to have EV charging pointThe government has handed Jaguar Land Rover a £500m loan guarantee to help accelerate its progress in the global electric vehicle race.Theresa May said the loan would help Britain’s biggest carmaker sell the next generation of electric cars around the world. She told a meeting of industry leaders at Downing Street on Monday that the funding pot would include £500m from UK Export Finance alongside another £125m from commercial lenders.The roundtable talks included executives from Aston Martin, BMW, Nissan and Vauxhall as well as energy groups BP, Shell and National Grid.The companies have agreed to set up a green mobility transition board that will formally bring together government, industry and environmental groups to coordinate plans for a switch from traditional to electric vehicles.May told the gathering that the government was committed to supporting the UK’s automotive sector and expected it to remain at the forefront of the design and manufacturing of electric vehicles.She set out a number of commitments to increase electric vehicle use, including plans for England to become the first country to introduce mandatory electric car charging points in new homes. There are fewer than 200,000 all electric vehicles on UK roads.Under the government’s plans, outlined by the Department for Transport, all new-build homes should be fitted with an electric car charge point to prepare for growing numbers of ultra-low-emission vehicles on UK roads.The government is also seeking views on how to use “smart” charging technology, which uses algorithms to automatically charge parked cars when electricity prices are at their lowest.The government said it wanted to end the sale of traditional combustion engine vehicles from 2040 but many – including the Committee on Climate Change – have warned the ban should come into force a decade sooner.This month Jaguar revealed plans to invest billions of pounds in building an electric version of the Jaguar XJ saloon at its Castle Bromwich factory. The proposals include a major upgrade of the plant, based in the outskirts of Birmingham, safeguarding the jobs of 2,500 people in what is a troubled time for the industry.

It’s not just in London and the south-east that rent levels are pricing certain professions out – the east and south-west are also unaffordable for many key workers.”In London, workers in their 20s were spending more than half their incomes on rent, making it impossible for them to save up the deposit to buy a home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a0602cc0cf06b1a03a90dadc656f178e3f78c24/0_157_4703_2822/master/4703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31740f2b780b0aeaada0d9903e876bd5","title":"invasion electric scooter backlash","story":"They’re cheaper than cabs, less effort than a bike and more convenient than buses. But as the number of e-scooter accidents rises, a backlash is growingMost of the people riding electric scooters around Copenhagen glide like swans, bodies motionless and serene with heads tilted into the sunshine.I am the ugly duckling, wobbling and jerking while I struggle to figure out exactly how this two-wheeled contraption works. Where do I put my feet? How hard do I thumb the accelerator? And how on earth am I meant to indicate left and press the brake with my left hand at the same time?It doesn’t take long to start gliding, even if I don’t feel very swanlike, or to notice that people in Denmark have found all sorts of less conventional ways to use e-scooters since they were introduced in January. Couple after couple perch together, heels of their feet barely balancing on the footplate. A traveller presses his suitcase between his knees while he crosses the junction near Tivoli Gardens. Two teenagers dart along the footpath outside the city’s central station, nipping between pedestrians.“I’ve seen a guy sitting on a suitcase using it as a scooter chair,” said Jesper Hemmingsen, a researcher at the Danish council for road safety, the RST. “I’ve seen parents delivering their children to school, a child standing at the front and their parents steering. It’s an easy way to get there, but it’s not a safe way. I’ve seen parents hire scooters for their kids to give them something to do. People treat them like toys. But they have no protection.”Over the past 18 months, it feels as though e-scooters have taken over many of the world’s cities. Scooter share firms have staked claims in more than 100 cities worldwide. Lime and Bird (from the US) and Voi, Circ, Flash and Tier (from Europe), are start-ups dripping with venture capital backing, attempting to create and carve up a market that is changing cityscapes everywhere.But piles of scooters discarded by the roadside, a worrying number of injuries and even some road deaths have provoked a growing backlash in some places.Those dangers were underscored recently when Emily Hartridge, a 35-year-old YouTuber and TV presenter, was killed while riding an e-scooter in Battersea, south-west London, after a collision with a lorry at a roundabout. Last month Paris – the e-scooter hub of Europe, with an estimated 20,000 trottinettes on the streets – saw its first fatality after a young man was hit by a truck.So are e-scooters a vital new part of modern, eco-friendly urban transport, or are they a risky and unnecessary fad, pushed by tech investors desperate to disrupt the status quo? And what can people in the UK, where the use of e-scooters remains illegal on both roads and pavements – despite the rise in models for sale in shops – learn from the experience of other European cities?Copenhagen, where e-scooters arrived nearly six months ago, is well-placed to answer this question. The police and road safety council are assessing the impact of the seven scooter firms and 7,000 scooters that have arrived since the Danish government introduced a trial period on 17 January.Pedestrians complain about scooters strewn across pavements and that they are a hazard for blind people and wheelchair users, as well as other anti-social behaviour: one young man rode an e-scooter through the aisles of a Netto supermarket in Odense seven times in one day.The city is flat, which helps, but more importantly there are miles and miles of wide roads with dedicated cycle lanes, usually raised and separated from car traffic with a kerb. No one has to compete for space. A scooter shouldn’t need to be anywhere near a lorry.But the road safety council is still worried about a growing number of injuries. “At the moment we have an assumption that it’s the same level of injuries for e-scooters as for cyclists,” Hemmingsen said, mentioning a recent study by two casualty departments in Copenhagen that found an average of about two injuries a day. About 800 cyclists a year are seriously injured.Copenhagen police are also acting. After running an information campaign, senior officers mounted an operation against drink-riders earlier this month, posting officers around the city centre.In one night last weekend, 24 e-scooter riders were stopped on suspicion of riding while over the legal alcohol limit, and four more for some form of narcotic intoxication, superintendent Allan Teddy Wadsworth-Hansen said. They face fines of up to 2,000 krone (£240).One of the motorcycle officers standing in Frederiksborggade, a main route into the heart of Copenhagen’s night life, stopped one rider and breathalysed him. Then a second arrived who had also been drinking. “While he’s still trying to process the first one, a third e-scooter turns up with two people on it,” Wadsworth-Hansen said. “When they see the police, they try to slow down. The woman on the back falls off – she wasn’t hurt seriously – and the driver turns out to be driving under the influence of alcohol. And then a fourth one approaches, and he has also been drinking.”Although there is sometimes a spike in the number of car drink-drivers over the summer, “you would never get four drivers in a row over the limit,” Wadsworth-Hansen said. “It doesn’t really bode well for e-scooters late in the evening, because drinking and driving is dangerous.”“Road users are used to seeing bicycles, but they’re not used to e-scooters. When you see someone standing up, arms by their sides, it’s easy at a glance to think they are a pedestrian and not realise they’re coming towards you at 20kmh,” he said.The experience of Parisians suggests that it’s not only e-scooter riders at risk. Isabelle van Brabant was hit by an e-scooter in the park at Les Halles in May, breaking her wrist in two places and causing a bone tear. For the pianist at the Paris Opera, it’s a professional disaster as well as a personal one. “She cannot play piano for one year, and piano is her life,” said her husband Jean-René Albertin. “When Isabelle was at the hospital, they said that each day 10 people come in for treatment. We think about 200 people a day are hurt.”They have set up a campaign group, Apacauvi, to win compensation for victims, with legal actions planned against the Paris municipal authorities and the rider who injured Van Brabant. “We have received 10,000 messages and we have about 850 people who want to participate in the association – people who have been hurt,” Albertin said.He wants the French government to force riders to take out insurance before they start riding, so that victims can be compensated from a central fund, even if an inidual rider cannot be identified.Paris’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, was in favour of e-scooters as a greener alternative to cars, but she has announced a crackdown on the “anarchic” dockless scooters. From this month, bad parking, riding on pavements and breaking the 20kmh speed limit will all result in fines. Police said they had issued 1,000 tickets and impounded 600 scooters.Albertin is unconvinced. “People just ignore the rules,” he said. But he is not in favour of an outright ban, as in the UK. “I don’t think making them illegal is right.”Britain remains a lacuna for the e-scooter share firms because, for at least the last 30 years, it has been against the law to ride them either on the road or the pavement. Electric scooters, like Segways, hoverboards, Go-Peds and self-propelled unicycles, are neither roadworthy enough under the Road Traffic Act 1988 to be registered as vehicles – complete with licence plate – nor can they be used on the pavement: an offence against the Highways Act 1835. People are occasionally prosecuted.Yet the e-scooter trade is flourishing. Halfords has 15 models available in the “kids zone” on its website. Argos has 23, also marketed as toys with designs from Trolls, Star Wars and Jurassic World. Ministers are in a bind, under pressure to liberalise or be left behind, while also wanting to enforce the law to prevent further tragedies like the one in Battersea.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told the Observer there was a “pressing need for the government to provide clarity and guidance” on e-scooters.In March, then transport minister Jesse Norman told the Observer he was considering licensing e-scooters, and his successor Michael Ellis is overseeing a review of legislation at the Department for Transport. But the government is also concerned about retailers flouting the law, and Ellis will hold a roundtable with Halfords, Lime, Bird and some manufacturers to urge them to tell consumers that they might be able to buy an e-scooter, but they can’t ride it in a public place.“We are examining whether they can be used safely on the road – and if so, how that should be regulated to ensure the public’s safety,” Ellis said. “However, companies must understand that reviewing laws does not necessarily mean laws will change. People who use e-scooters need to be aware it is currently illegal to ride them on the pavement and the road.”At night, the streets of Copenhagen are busy with e-scooters, and it’s easy to see why so many people have been stopped recently for drink-riding. You’re free to travel on a whim: it is cheaper and more immediate than cabs, far more convenient than buses or trains, and doesn’t require the effort of riding a bicycle.“It has completely ided people,” Hemmingsen said, as we walk round the meatpacking district. “Either people think they are the best thing ever or they are a scourge. I saw someone had put one in a rubbish bin. They dredged the harbour in March and they found 12, and scooters have only been here since January.”Here, there are neat rows of five Lime scooters on the street corners, and we soon catch up with the person leaving them there: Andrew, a Romanian driving a Lime van who has been working in Copenhagen for two months, repairing and recharging the scooters.He shows me how the handles, the GPS tracker and other parts of the scooter are damaged – “by drunk people” – but not very often. In other cities, scooter-share companies will pay freelancers, nicknamed “juicers”, a bounty for each scooter they charge, but Andrew says that there are 20 people like him in Copenhagen who are all well-paid Lime employees.There is some dispute about how long an e-scooter will last – some need to be replaced after just 28 days’ use in Paris, Albertin says, while Hemmingsen says they can go for up to three months. Andrew says many last much longer. The closest comparison in the UK is with dockless bike companies, three of whom have pulled out of the market within a year, complaining that vandalism in Britain is higher than anywhere else they have done business.The e-scooter firms say they take safety very seriously, and each app will remind riders of some basic safety tips when they scan and hire a scooter. Kristina Nilsson of Voi said the Swedish firm was in the process of creating dedicated parking spots in the 31 cities where they operate, giving riders the incentive of extra credits if they leave them in the right place.“We’re also in the process of rolling out speed zones, so in certain areas you go slower than 20kmh,” she said. Nilsson claims the crackdown by Paris is having an effect: “I understand Paris will have a tender for having only three players there. And we hope to be one of those three.”Some cycling charities see e-scooters as potential allies in the battle to get better cycle paths. Rachel White, head of policy at Sustrans in the UK, said they were “generally supportive” of scooters, if speeds were limited and they were kept off pavements. Beyond safety, they are only worried that having access to effortless travel might make us put in less effort. “A slight concern is that they don’t have the same health benefits as walking or cycling,” she said. “But generally, another group of organisations lobbying for more protective cycleways can only be a good thing.”The UK’s road network may yet dictate the future of e-scooters. In London the volume of traffic dwarfs the number of cars in Copenhagen while the cycling network is far less developed. London has 239km of cycle paths – less than the 375km in Copenhagen, and serving 13 times as many people. And outside the capital, the fragmented and often unreliable public transport system means commuters are wedded to their cars.Paul Hodgkin, CEO of UK mobility start-up Ginger, believes that in spite of this, Britain can introduce e-scooters safely. His firm is in talks about putting e-scooters in business parks and campus universities – on private land. “Innovation is happening elsewhere. Wait-and-see is not a neutral position. If we take too long, the industry will move on and we won’t be able to help set the model and get it right,” Hodgkin said.• This article was amended on 15 July 2019 to clarify a comparison of cycle paths serving London and Copenhagen, measured in kilometres.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d298d1301a59fe025fcea94f255a2f109f1d061/0_311_6300_3780/master/6300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4618742833ebc22425950fc57b71b9cf","title":"the innisfil experiment the town that replaced public transit with uber","story":"Ridership is high and there’s plenty of work for drivers, but success has come at a cost to this Ontario townPhotographs by Cole BurstonWhen Daniel Arrega, 19, heads to work at a mall in Innisfil, he has few options for his commute. Walking along the highway would take nearly three hours. A taxi is faster but expensive.So he takes the town’s public transit: Uber.“It’s great for young people, especially if you don’t have a licence,” he said after arriving at the branch of Tommy Hilfiger where he works. In 2017, the town in Ontario, Canada, embarked on an ambitious – and, to its critics, fraught – experiment. It handed responsibility for public transit to the ride-sharing app Uber.Instead of buses or trains plying regular routes, it is Uber’s roving cars that function as the transit fleet. When a rider opens the app, Innisfil Transit pops up as the cheapest option to travel between a network of popular areas called “hubs”, such as libraries, the recreation centre or municipal buildings.The costs per ride vary, but on average passengers pay an average of CAD$5 (£3), with the city subsiding the rest. Trips outside subsidised areas receive a flat $6 discount.Two years later, the Innisfil authorities argue that the project has been a success. Ridership is high – in 2018 there were 85,943 trips – and many residents have embraced the service.“We just absolutely love Uber. I take it, my son takes it, my dad takes it. I take it,” said Shannon Kelly-Robb, who works at one of the libraries.But beyond the excitement of essentially having subsidised taxi service, experts paint a more troubling picture of questionable economic and environmental sustainability. The city has now spent more on Uber than the traditional transit option it was considering, and has dramatically increased the number of cars on its roads, with worrying implications for air quality and the climate crisis.What’s more, Innisfil Transit has now attracted attention as the latest step in a growing assault on public transit systems by ride-sharing companies. Urban planners fear Uber isn’t just taking riders away from public transit but that it is hoping to replace public transit altogether.In the cities of London, Ontario, and Denver, Uber has integrated public transit options into its app to become a “one-stop shop for transportation”. In regulatory filings, published in advance of its May IPO, Uber said it wants to “replace personal vehicle ownership and usage and public transportation one use case at a time”.Innisfil’s deal with Uber is nothing “other than a more expedited and abundant taxi system. That’s all it is,” said Jarrett Walker, a transit consultant based in Portland, Oregon, and author of Human Transit. “The notion that Uber has anything useful to offer public transit is just preposterous.”Innisfil saw it differently. A community of 40,000 north of Toronto, it is a typical small North American town, with widely spaced houses on large lots that makes efficient public transit a logistical challenge.The town desperately needed transit, said Paul Pentikainen, Innisfil’s senior planner. But the option on the table – three bus routes – would cost the council nearly $1m. So they tried to think creatively.The contract also meant more work for Uber drivers, whose number in Innisfil increased to 2,203 in 2018. “I just needed a sustainable income after I retired,” said Dennis West, who started driving for Uber in December 2017. “This is a nice gig. You can do it when you want to do it – and you can do it as much as you want to do it. It works well.”But success has come at an ironic cost to the town. Because Innisfil subsidises each ride, the more successful it is, the more the town pays to Uber. That figure is now projected to reach $1.2m for 2019 – more than the bus programme would have cost, and well above the $900,000 the city allocated. With ridership increasing each year, costs will only rise.In fact, the town has taken the extraordinary step of deterring people from using Uber too much, capping the number of rides a resident can take per month. For mall worker Arrega, who has been “working like crazy”, that often means exceeding the limit midway through the month, although the town allows riders to apply for an exemption. It has also increased the cost of a ride by $1.Still, he understands why Innisfil made the decision, saying it might be the right thing to do for a sprawling town with low population density where bus stops would be far from destinations.Nevertheless, Uber’s messaging is working: planners from other cities have contacted Innisfil for advice on how to create a similar system, said Pentikainen.But Spieler warns that what might work for more rural areas would be a disaster in denser cities.Pentikainen also brushed off concerns with Uber’s controversial labour practices, which have received intense scrutiny in many cities, saying drivers “absolutely love the job” and the town has received no complaints over compensation.As for the environmental impact, there is even less doubt about the negative impact. Compared to fixed routes, said Walker, a system like Innisfil Transit “usually means carrying few people at higher costs, therefore achieving lower climate benefits”.Both Walker and Spieler still argue that there is a role for private companies to deliver transit services, but say apps masquerading as novel innovations can obscure more important components of a transit system – namely, serving a public need beyond of any short-term costs savings by developing infrastructure to allow for environmentally sustainable and financially accessible services for the future.What’s more, with the precarious finances of larger ride-sharing companies now well known, municipalities have yet another reason to worry.“We know that Lyft and Uber are both losing massive amounts of money. We know they are both underpaying their drivers,” said Spieler. “If you’re doing this to save money, what insurance do you have that five years from now, it will still save you money?In the meantime, Innisfil officials have openly mused about fixing some of the problems of Uber – by turning to Uber. The latest suggestion to the cost overruns? UberBus: a bus that runs a fixed route, just like a normal city bus.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"12 of the best beaches in wales in pictures","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

Chemical flame retardants are still being widely used in our furnishings, from children’s mattresses to sofas. Meanwhile the government is sitting on its hands instead of changing regulations to ensure that the most toxic chemicals are taken out of use.”The MPs called for the government to respond to a 2016 review of fire safety regulations before the new prime minister takes office on 24 July.The EAC also raised concerns about the “huge number” of chemicals used in plastic and food packaging, “some of which have been identified as harmful to human health and the environment”.The MPs called for a UK-wide ban on the use in “food contact materials” of substances defined as being of high concern by European chemicals regulations.The wide-ranging report called for biomonitoring to establish levels of chemical exposure in the UK population, and recommended a specific programme for residents and firefighters caught up in the Grenfell Tower fire.“We are troubled by the lack of urgency in response to the findings of environmental contamination around the Grenfell Tower site,” the MPs said.Residents have reported the emergence of “Grenfell cough” and health problems including vomiting, coughing up blood, skin complaints and breathing difficulties, the EAC said.Creagh said: “We need to know the extent of people’s exposure to chemical contamination, which is why we are calling for a biomonitoring programme across the UK, with specific monitoring for residents around Grenfell Tower. Officials took more than a year to begin soil testing around the site of the fire after the first evidence of environmental contamination was found.”The report also said chemicals were routinely used in products where their presence was not indicated on the label.“Consumers have the right to know what chemicals are used in the products they purchase,” it said, arguing for reforms to labelling.Professor Anna Stec, professor in fire chemistry and toxicity at the University of Central Lancashire, said the report should “signal a turning point in the UK’s approach to fire safety and toxicity”.“In particular, it recognises the urgent need to quantify the toxicants that Grenfell residents and firefighters have been exposed to.“To drive real change, fire safety testing of upholstered furniture and construction products should include an assessment of fire toxicity. This will avoid the use of chemical flame retardants that often cost less but make fires more toxic, so that lives are not needlessly put at risk in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e80acb65354300007ec5b417d25ac56221652d9/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c39779e295fb30cd1a256afb52a7d7d0","title":"true cost of cheap food is health and climate crises says commission","story":"Radical change needed to make UK food and farming system sustainable within 10 yearsThe true cost of cheap, unhealthy food is a spiralling public health crisis and environmental destruction, according to a high-level commission. It said the UK’s food and farming system must be radically transformed and become sustainable within 10 years.The commission’s report, which was welcomed by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, concluded that farmers must be enabled to shift from intensive farming to more organic and wildlife friendly production, raising livestock on grass and growing more nuts and pulses. It also said a National Nature Service should be created to give opportunities for young people to work in the countryside and, for example, tackle the climate crisis by planting trees or restoring peatlands.“Time is now running out. The actions that we take in the next 10 years are critical: to recover and regenerate nature and to restore health and wellbeing to both people and planet,” said the commission, which was convened by the RSA, a group focused on pressing social challenges.The commission said most farmers thought they could make big changes in five to 10 years if they got the right backing.“Farmers are extraordinarily adaptable,” said Sue Pritchard, director of the RSA commission and an organic farmer in Wales. “We have to live with change every single day of our lives.“We are really keen that farmers feel they are in the driving seat and that they can be a force of change. At the moment, a lot of farmers feel beleaguered and that they have become the bad guys. But without sustainable, secure and safe farming in the UK, we will not survive.”The commission criticised decades of government policy aimed at making food cheaper, fuelling rising obesity and other health problems. “The true cost of that is simply passed off elsewhere in society – in a degraded environment, spiralling ill health and impoverished high streets,” said the report.Pritchard said the UK had the third cheapest basket of food in the developed world, but also had the highest food poverty in Europe in terms of people being able to afford a healthy diet. Type 2 diabetes, a diet-related illness, costs the UK £27bn a year, she said.To solve these crises, the commission said “agroecology” practices must be supported – such as organic farming and agroforestry, where trees are combined with crops and livestock such as pigs or egg-laying hens.The so-called planetary health diet calls for more nuts and pulses in diets and Pritchard said these and more vegetables could be grown in the UK. Hazelnuts and walnuts are native to the UK, she pointed out, and some farmers are now starting to grow crops like lentils and quinoa, as well as beans and peas.The commission said the government must develop a plan to put the countryside and the communities living there at the centre of the green economy.Gove said: “This report raises issues that are hugely important. We know that it is in the interests of farmers and landowners to move to a more sustainable model.” He added that the government’s agriculture bill would reward farmers with public money for public goods and a new “farm to fork” food review would look to ensure everyone had access to healthy British food.The report was backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “This monumental report is a powerful and profound account of the ecological transformation of our food and farming system that we urgently need – and where we can start.”The commission said a new non-profit bank should be set up to provide finance to farmers investing in new practices.With Brexit uncertainty worrying farmers, the commission urged minister to stop delays on policy and trade decisions and commit to a future-proof ambition by January 2020. It also said schools, hospitals and prisons should buy more sustainably produced British food.Prof Joanna Price, the vice-chancellor of the Royal Agricultural University, said: “The report paints an honest picture of the challenges and sets out some bold ideas to address them. We strongly agree that farming can be a force for positive change and that rural communities can thrive as a powerhouse for a green economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801e44bbbdc1707ef6972a145c98e1a88cae216e/0_299_3721_2232/master/3721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6c30c883159fcfb4042c41dfdfc1c8b","title":"james bond 007 black female actor lashana lynch daniel craig","story":"Online joy over Lashana Lynch inheriting James Bond’s codename may be premature. White men won’t give up their hero status so easilyFans have been hoping for a black actor to play James Bond at least since 2012, when Idris Elba was first rumoured as a possible successor to Daniel Craig. The franchise seems to have finally come through this weekend it was reported that Lashana Lynch is going to be the new 007.There was much celebration on social media, which is understandable. But it may be a little premature. Casting black female actors as legacy characters is a great step towards rectifying the historical racism and sexism that has led to a disproportionate number of those characters being white men. But it’s only a step. Black women also need to be written with respect they have to be presented as natural, worthy heroes who deserve to wear the cowl or cape or tux in question. Otherwise, the new hero just becomes another way to demonstrate that the real, worthy hero is the white guy.There are numerous examples of this dynamic. One is the character of James Rhodes, who in various Marvel comics takes over from Tony Stark as the hero Iron Man. Rhodes is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), too, and has long been presented as a kind of successor in waiting for Robert Downey Jr’s Stark.But, despite being the heir to the Iron Man helmet, Rhodes has never managed to get much attention or respect in the MCU. He was first played in the original Iron Man film by Terrence Howard, but creative and money differences meant the actor was cut from Iron Man 2. The role was taken over by Don Cheadle, who got to suit up as War Machine, an Iron Man clone, in a number of MCU films.After Stark dies in Endgame, though, it’s not Rhodes who is pushed forward as his heroic heir, but the white Spider-ManPeter Parker (Tom Holland). Parker is willed access to Stark’s global weapons system in Spider-Man: Far From Home. He and the entire cast of that movie talk at length about who should pick up Stark’s legacy. The most obvious answer is Rhodes, the guy who’s been piloting the armour for years. But he’s not even mentioned no one, apparently, remembers that he exists. Casting a black man as an important legacy character doesn’t matter much if you push him off to the side as soon as it’s his turn to put on the boots.Netflix’s Marvel show Iron Fist dumped its POC legacy character even more dramatically. The martial arts master Iron FistDanny Rand was portrayed for two seasons by Finn Jones. In the last episodes of season two, the Iron Fist power, complete with chest tattoo, was passed to Colleen Wing, played by Jessica Henwick, an Asian woman. Jones never seemed comfortable in the Iron Fist role his Danny Rand was a whiny nonentity, and he performed the fight choreography with a remarkable lack of conviction. Henwick was a much more likable and physically adept performer. It would have been exciting to see her in the title role. But as soon as it passed to her, Netflix cancelled the show.Another instructive example is the character of Bonnie in the television show The Vampire Diaries. In the books that the series is based on, Bonnie is white. The showrunners, though, chose to cast actress Kat Graham. That was meant to be a progressive move. But, as Ebony Elizabeth Thomas argues in her book The Dark Fantastic, the results were mixed. The show’s creators cut out most of Bonnie’s romantic plot arcs and made her a much less sympathetic character than she is in the books. They may have been concerned that white viewers would have trouble identifying with a black character. Whatever their reasons, Thomas points out that the casting change alone was not enough to overcome the powerful impulse to treat black girls’ stories as secondary to those of their white counterparts.The difficulty with changing legacy characters is that the original is generally seen as the iconic version, and successors are temporary and secondary. As a result, the non-white or non-male versions of the character can be treated as afterthoughts or sidekicks, or as mistakes to be quietly pushed from centre stage.There are some counterexamples. The animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse featured African-Latino Miles Morales as Spider-Man, and Morales did get to be the hero of the story, with Peter Parker serving as secondary support. Similarly, Jodie Whittaker’s Dr Who is unquestionably the star of her own episodes. Ocean’s Eight gender-swapped Ocean’s Eleven, and, while a couple of characters from the original franchise have cameos, they never steal the spotlight from the women (as if anyone could steal the spotlight from Rihanna).So will the new Bond treat Lashana Lynch as the real, heroic, central 007? Early reports suggest maybe not. Supposedly, Lynch has inherited the 007 codename, and her mission is to ask Craig’s Bond to come out of retirement for a serious mission. That sounds as if the white, male Bond is still considered the best of the best, with Lynch relegated to a supporting role. It’s not hard to imagine her written as little more than another, slightly glorified Bond girl, who gets killed off halfway through.Or the franchise could do better than that. If the plan is to set up Lynch to take over the mantle from Craig and helm a few Bond movies herself, that would be great. But it’s premature to give the film-makers too much credit. Experience suggests that, no matter what they say to the contrary, white guys are reluctant to pass their legacies on to anyone else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ff85c1697d49a38811677a4a8b351f6d1bb925f/1397_23_1437_862/master/1437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c1dceec99eec30fa0dffe5d5bfebdaf","title":"lashana lynch new 007 james bond daniel craig","story":"Daniel Craig retains title role but 25th instalment in the franchise reveals codename has been reassigned to British actor Lashana LynchWhile Daniel Craig is set to reprise his role as James Bond in the next film, the franchise is set for a shake-up, with reports claiming that black British actor Lashana Lynch has been cast as 007 – taking over Bond’s secret agent number after his character leaves MI6.The Mail has quoted from an anonymous “movie insider”, who says that the 25th film opens with Bond (Craig), retired in Jamaica, being called back to action to fight a new villain.“There is a pivotal scene at the start of the film where M says, “Come in 007”, and in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman,” the source said. “It’s a popcorn-dropping moment.

I had never before thought of it in the same light as a tomato, but tossed in this simple salsa, its sweetness and acidity work remarkably well with the caramelised, fatty pork.Although you can slow cook ribs, they are also beautifully tender when roasted hot and fast.For the marinade1 dried chipotle chilli, or 1 tbsp smoked paprika2 tsp cumin seeds2 garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp dijon mustard2 tbsp tomato puree2 tbsp molasses sugar75ml cider vinegarSalt and black pepperFor the pineapple salsa½ small, ripe pineapple, peeled and core removed½ red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped½ small bunch mint, finely chopped ½ small red onion, peeled and finely choppedJuice of 1 limeHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan) 390Fgas 6, if you are going to cook the ribs without marinating. For the marinade, put the chipotle chilli in a small pan, cover with boiling water and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until soft. (Alternatively, to speed things up, put the chilli and water in a heatproof bowl and blast in a microwave for a minute or two). Once soft, discard the stem and remove most of the seeds. Transfer to a tall jug with the cumin, garlic, mustard, tomato puree and molasses sugar. Blitz with a stick blender, slowly pouring in the vinegar to create a smooth paste, and season well with salt and pepper.Put the ribs in a large, foil or silicon-lined baking tray and rub in the marinade. Preferably, leave to marinate for a few hours, or overnight, but if you want to serve them sooner you can cook them immediately. Roast for an hour, turning them over halfway, until the ribs are golden, caramelised and the meat is soft. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and rest somewhere warm for 10 minutes.To make the salsa, cut the pineapple into long, thin strips, then finely chop and transfer to a bowl. Add the other ingredients, and season to taste, adding more lime if needed, and a pinch of sugar if the pineapple is not sweet enough.Serve the ribs with the salsa, some baked potatoes and a crisp slaw of wafer-thin red and white cabbage, radishes, fennel and chopped coriander.Sweat two onions in butter for 15 minutes until soft, then add the marinade ingredients, plus half a bottle of ketchup for a delicious homemade barbecue sauce (ramp up the chilli, if you like).

Everton will pay an initial £8.5m for the midfielder, rising to £10m with add-ons. The former Leeds and Aston Villa player has signed a three-year deal at Goodison.Delph joined his new teammates at their pre-season training camp in Verbier, Switzerland, on Monday and insists he retains an appetite for silverware despite leaving the Etihad Stadium.He said: “The club that I’ve been at has had success, especially in the last two seasons, but over the last four years we managed to win trophies. I wanted to be playing more regularly and the opportunity to come and play for Everton Football Club was too good of an opportunity to turn down.“I’m hungry. I don’t like losing. I see myself as a winner. I’m at an age now where I am probably one of the most experienced players, so hopefully I can bring that and try to help my teammates here to do better. Ultimately, the goal is to win something. I’ve not come here just to be here – I’ve come here with ambitions to win things.”At 29, Delph does not fit the profile of Everton signings outlined by their director of football, Marcel Brands, although he has stated that allowances will be made for older, good value targets. Silva, however, is keen to add more dominant personalities into the dressing room and believes an England international with title-winning experience can be an important addition.The Everton manager said: “When I look to bring a new player into our squad, the first thing I look for above all the other things is quality and Fabian is a player with high-quality. But what they can bring to our dressing room is also important and if you can put those two things together then that can only be good for the club. Fabian is a player that can give us different solutions in our midfield because he can play in more than one position and that is important for us.”Delph is Everton’s third signing of the summer following fellow midfielder Andre Gomes and former Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97f881b7dff44a36c59fdaa79d5d7dd5b85bd81e/0_429_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d217b1de087e1d63ade28614506035b","title":"paul pogba increasingly likely to stay at manchester united","story":"Manchester United confidently expect to persuade David de Gea to sign a new contract but have been unsuccessful so far because of the goalkeeper’s determination to drive a hard deal and establish himself among the highest earners in world football.With De Gea now in the final year of his contract, United have been trying for the last 18 months to persuade the Spain international to agree new terms and abandon thoughts of moving to another club. United’s stance has never altered but the matter has been complicated by De Gea’s advisers insisting their client receives a financial package that recognises he has been the club’s player-of-the-year in four out of the last six seasons.De Gea’s financial requirements are said to be significantly higher than the widely reported numbers of £350,000 a week and, though United have been keen to find a resolution, the numbers being so high explain why it has been such a difficult and drawn-out process.If everything goes according to plan and De Gea agrees to remain in Manchester, he will become the best-paid goalkeeper in the history of the sport. That in itself is not a problem for United but the club’s position has been weakened by the publicity surrounding Alexis Sánchez’s salary, giving De Gea’s representatives the opportunity to argue that their man is more deserving of being in the club’s highest wage bracket.As well as challenging Manchester City for the signing of the England centre-back Harry Maguire from Leicester, there have been discussions at Old Trafford about the potential availability of Sean Longstaff, the Newcastle midfielder.However, it is not clear yet whether that will result in a bid being tabled and, if not, it may be more that they keep close tabs on the 21-year-old over the coming season.One player who will not be moving to Old Trafford is Mario Lemina of Southampton, the suspicion being that the Gabonese midfielder has been erroneously linked to Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s team in an attempt to attract genuine bids from other clubs.Paul Pogba’s hopes of leaving United this summer are becoming remote with the club receiving no bids for the France midfielder and the transfer window closing in less than a month.The deadline of this summer’s transfer window is 8 August and is an issue regarding any potential deal. Solskjær has already lost a midfielder in Ander Herrera, who joined Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent, so if Pogba was to depart it would be difficult for the manager to have to replace a second midfielder in the three and a half weeks left of the window.Real Madrid would like to sign Pogba but their valuation is markedly lower than United’s. Real price him between £100-120m with United wanting closer to £170m.Both Pogba and his agent Mino Raiola have recently admitted the player’s wish would be to leave so if he was to stay Solskjær would face a challenge to ensure dressing room harmony is not affected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7945f7520c8f361b5fd9ca45d7ea03f0a741d833/0_186_5025_3015/master/5025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3277ae13c51e1a2238f7d845bc6a2f6","title":"rose seeds from syria refugee family cultivating new life lebanon","story":"Sweet-smelling success for Syrians who have settled in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley is dampened by growing anti-Syrian sentimentby Jenny Gustafsson in the Bekaa valley photographs by Alia HajuWhen the plastic bucket is filled with roses, Nahla al-Zarda takes it into the kitchen, where she separates the petals from the buds. She soaks them in boiling water, which blushes pink.“I love this colour. It will be even stronger when the drink is ready,” she says.Her husband, Salem al-Azouq, a man in his mid-40s, is out picking in the small field behind his house, which is filled with roses of the same shade.“There was nothing here when we came five years ago. It looked like that,” he says, pointing to the wheat plantations on either side of the plot.It is six years now since they came to Lebanon, and five years since they moved to the makeshift house at the edge of the plantation. Before that, they were in a refugee camp, like many of the 1 to 2 million Syrians in the country.Al-Azouq works quickly and with ease. He only picks large buds, leaving the smaller ones for later. Now, during the season, he harvests two or three times a week, preferably in the early morning.“That is the best time. The rose is still asleep, holding on to its fragrance,” he says.Behind his back, in the far distance, lies the mountain range separating Lebanon from Syria. Al-Azouq’s home village is beyond those mountains, in a farming area near Damascus.He started coming to Lebanon in 2006 for seasonal work, just like hundreds of thousands of other Syrians. It was always in cultivation: roses and trees were his speciality. Then, the war came. The couple, with their small twin daughters and baby son, fled.“We had just spent all our savings on building a house. Nothing is left of it now. You don’t even hear birds singing in our village today,” says al-Azouq.His youngest son, two-year-old Ahmad, follows his father through the field. When they pass by a tap and buckets being filled up, he stops to play with the water. Al-Azouq points to the different things he grows: red and white roses for people’s gardens, trees about to bear fruit, rosemary, basil and lavender. But the star is a bright pink rose with a fragrant smell, the one he was picking earlier.“It’s the sultani, the best kind of rose. No other has the same strong flavour,” he says.For the rose growers of Lebanon and Syria (lands that gave name to the Damascus rose, cherished by Shakespeare, the Babylonians and ancient Egyptians), this is what ultimately matters. Most of their roses go into making one of the most significant culinary products in the region: rose water.This scented liquid, still produced with the same distillation technique that 11th-century medical scholar Ibn Sina invented, is used in a range of Middle Eastern recipes. Lebanese and Syrians add it to their cheese dessert kanafeh, as well as their date cookies and syrupy baklava. Turks and Iranians flavour ice cream and Turkish delight with it Indians their lassi.Sweets aside, rose water has always had an important place in folk medicine as well, and is used for ailments including digestive issues, high blood pressure and insomnia.“For us, it is part of our tradition of mouneh, preserving food for the winter. This is how we capture the flavours of the season,” says Lebanese food writer Barbara Massaad.The couple do not produce rose water themselves – they do not have the equipment, and al-Azouq’s expertise lies in cultivation and growing. They sell to others in Lebanon doing distillation, both in the Bekaa Valley and on the coast.Despite the history that Lebanon shares with Syria, and the many family ties that cut across the border, anti-Syrian attitudes have been growing in the country. Refugee settlements have been raided and families evicted, and municipalities have imposed curfews on Syrians.“Families are not allowed to leave the camps without a permit, not even to buy water or see the doctor,” says Doha Adi from the organisation Sawa for Development and Aid.After several years of extending great hospitality to Syrian refugees, Lebanon has been struggling with an economic crisis and foreign minister Gebran Bassil recently made anti-refugee statements on Twitter and in speeches.“This way, people are steered towards blaming refugees for their worries, even when they have nothing to do with it,” says Adi.Cultivating roses, al-Azouq and al-Zarda work in one of only three sectors legally open for Syrians: agriculture, construction and waste management. They pay rent for their land, as all refugees do, including the majority of those living in camps.“The flowers we grow are from Syria. We brought seeds with us when we left,” says al-Azouq.He stretches out his hand to pick a rose and almost grabs hold of a bee – but that is OK, he says, he usually gets stung once a day.“I am happy for the bees. They are a sign that the fields are healthy.”Al-Azouq brings two-year-old Ahmad into the kitchen. He is about to go and pick up the other children from school, then pass by the organic farm he runs together with other Syrians, Lebanese and a French brother and sister. Using natural techniques, they aim to protect the bioersity of the region, not least species that have suffered from the war in Syria. They cultivate a range of fruits and vegetables there – but no roses. These are reserved for the family’s backyard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23004210bbfa25a6bb8214e300f849896bcfbae5/0_423_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7b37ce5fdea03f910c3cc77cba6c718","title":"eating disorder obsessive exercise swimming plumpness power","story":"I was used to strict fitness regimes, but lazy, pleasure-driven swims helped me to feel more comfortable in my own skinIt was last September, while on a hen weekend in north Wales, that I realised how important swimming had become to me.There was a temporary break in the organised fun and a clutch of attendees I vaguely knew from university asked if I would join them for a dip at the nearby beach. The conditions were hardly dreamy: it was raining I hadn’t bought a bathing suit the only towel I could use was the child-sized one provided by the Airbnb. But I took them up on it all the same. “I’ll be with you in five minutes,” I said, grinning.In the past, I would have required more coaxing spontaneous, sociable swims were hardly my default mode of exercise. I’d suffered from anorexia in sixth form, and although I’d recovered while at university, in my mid 20s I’d started to slip back into that old, punitive mindset. Supposedly “healthy” eating plans were accompanied by a strict exercise regime: running. Five times a week. Solo. (Just like when I was a calorie-counting A-levels student, I craved control. Having someone join me would require compromise and flexibility – two concepts that seemed about as palatable to my weight-conscious self as supersize tubs of lard.)To clarify, this wasn’t a constant period of anguish. Rather, it was three years or so in which I’d flit between nervy months of restraint and periods of respite when I somehow felt grounded enough to … well, chill out a bit. In these stretches, I could skive my runs entirely – or ditch them for a more leisurely form of exercise. I started going for lazy, pleasure-driven swims, and in doing so clutched at a lifeline that would eventually haul me from the whirlpool of self-criticism and obsessiveness for good. (Well, almost.)As a child I had enjoyed visiting my local pool, but seeing as you can hardly open a newspaper nowadays without someone gushing about wild swimming, the adult me gravitated outdoors. On trips to visit family in Sweden, I floated languorously around calm, cavernous lakes. And like all good arty millennials in London, on boiling Saturdays I made for the ponds on Hampstead Heath.It wasn’t until the hen party, though, that I realised how profoundly swimming had changed me.Tragically, a women-only weekend like that – one involving glamorous outfits and carefully apportioned “getting ready” time – would normally bring out the worst of my neuroses. But instead of glaring at my thighs in the mirror, I was bobbing up and down in the sea in greying underwear, too busy squealing at the cold to think about anything else.The physical benefits of wild swimming are well documented. But for me it was about more than the rush of adrenaline that comes with charging into a freezing sea, or the blissed-out peace you feel while towel-drying your hair in the cool evening air. Swimming outdoors, it turned out, had fundamentally recalibrated my mindset around exercise. After all, unlike running, it wasn’t an activity that I could control and schedule. Unless you’re phenomenally hardy, it’s weather-dependent – and, equally, unless you happen to have a lido on your doorstep, it hinges on location. You do it with friends, and having company blasts any perfectionist routines (“If I don’t do blah lengths in blah amount of time, I will have failed!”) out of the water. I started to appreciate the relief that comes with letting forces beyond yourself – the weather, the seasons, other people – dictate your agenda. While it’s no bad thing to take your fate into your own hands, I had a habit of squashing it once it was there. Swimming taught me the good that can come from letting go.It also helped me to embrace my body. After all, in the water, plumpness is power. When I was at my lightest, in school, I was cold all the time – and swimming, particularly outdoors, was out of the question. But now I can do lengths and lengths without a worry. I’ve stopped dieting, and while numerous factors brought that about, the way swimming made me feel more comfortable in my own skin undoubtedly contributed.Nowadays, I get into the water as much as I can. But it isn’t a strict routine I approach it as a treat, like going for an ice-cream. While I still run, swimming has helped me see the benefits of exercising less intensively. I do a slow jog a couple of times a week – and most of the time it is motivated by a desire to let off steam rather than a compulsion to shed calories.I’d be lying if I said I had shaken off my anxieties completely. I suspect I will always have an obsessive side. Happily, though, swimming is not only helping to keep this under control – it is also the result of doing so. If I’m relaxed enough to jump into the waves on an overcast Saturday, chances are, life is pretty sweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b01f58e04f9596cd30673e0eb8cfcc9a816a253/176_0_5104_3064/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db2128b1cbe57c9389ad0aacb4bc67f6","title":"how we met his tinder profile said he wanted to cycle round the world i asked when are we leaving","story":"Mike and Helen Langridge live in Edinburgh. Mike, 32, is a solicitor and Helen, 30, works for an outdoors clothing companyWhen Helen saw on Mike’s Tinder profile that he was a keen cyclist and wanted to cycle around the world, she sent him a message. “I said: ‘When are we leaving?’,” she recalls, “and he said: ‘How about Tuesday?’”When they met up in a pub a week later, in January 2016, they talked about the trip. “It was, initially, ‘Wouldn’t it be funny? How would you do it?’,” says Helen. “It was on the second date that it started to be a bit more: ‘Why shouldn’t we do it?’ We weren’t happy with our jobs, and we had no responsibilities to hold us back.”After four weeks they were a couple, and after five months they moved in together, mainly to save money. They sold everything worth selling, and stopped spending. Mike was working long hours as a trainee solicitor, but took an evening job in a restaurant. Helen worked in a medical lab and transcribed medical notes in the evenings. In November 2016, Mike proposed, and in April 2017, they embarked on their round-the-world cycle ride. They left on a Tuesday.“Lots of people would say to us, especially when we’d been on the road for a while, ‘That must be like 10 years of marriage condensed into 18 months,’” says Mike. “In a way it was, because we spent every day together.”They didn’t cycle side by side the whole way. “We would very rarely lose sight of each other, but it didn’t mean we were always in conversation every second of the day,” says Helen. “Occasionally I wanted some of my own time, but even then I was like: ‘Don’t go too far.’”They got to know each other, and themselves. “It was a big lesson in compromise, communication and listening,” says Mike. “Not just what someone was saying, but all the non-verbal things: is Helen tired? Is she stressed? She’s saying we can go on, but does she mean it?”And they saw each other during extreme moments. Cycling across Australia – in 40C heat, into a headwind that meant they couldn’t travel more than six miles an hour – was the most brutal time, physically and mentally. “For weeks on end, nothing changed,” says Helen. “We both reacted very differently to release that stress.”Helen cried every day Mike tended to bottle up his emotions, but, after a minor disagreement, had a meltdown. “It’s probably quite a rare thing to learn about a partner,” says Helen. “I guess not many people experience that kind of extreme to know how the other person would react.”Moving on to the US, they cycled from San Diego to Yosemite national park, where they got married. “I think by then we’d done a year and about 12,000 miles,” says Mike. “We were like: ‘We’ll be fine we’ll still love each other enough to get married.’” Their parents and a couple of friends flew out, then Mike and Helen carried on. It was about a month later that Mike nearly died of hypothermia in the Rockies. “That was our honeymoon,” he says with a small laugh.They had left Salt Lake City and were cycling along the hard shoulder of the interstate highway when a storm came in. Within minutes the temperature had dropped to about 4C and there was nowhere to shelter. Helen was in front. “Over the noise of the traffic I heard him shout, so I turned around and he had his eyes closed but he was screaming and crying, and he wasn’t really with it. I don’t know how he hadn’t already cycled into traffic because he was weaving along the hard shoulder with his eyes closed. I dropped my bike, and caught him. His body was curling over the bike and I couldn’t unfurl him.” She turns to him. “You weren’t reacting to me.”She waved a car down and a man helped drag Mike off the bike and get him into the car to try and warm him up until the ambulance arrived.After Mike recovered, they cycled on through Canada, and two months later flew to France and made their way back home, arriving in the UK in August last year. Was it hard to get back to a more normal life? “It’s almost like it never happened,” says Helen. “All those amazing experiences and places and people, it’s like it never happened.” Mike had the harder task, she says, going back to work so quickly.There are new adventures, though of a more stationary kind (they are buying their first house). Everything in their relationship until now had been focused on the trip, says Helen – either planning it, or on it. “I think there was a risk that our relationship was so based around that trip that it could have fallen apart once we came back,” she says. “But it’s very naturally changed into a relationship at home.”Want to share your story?

What’s behind the malaise?Louise set herself two New Year’s resolutions for 2019: to start yoga, and to keep a journal. She did better than most people, sticking to both for five months. About six weeks ago, however, she recognised something was off. “During May, I noticed all I kept writing was how lethargic, below average or ill I was feeling.”Writing in her journal in the first week of June, the 30-year-old from Nottinghamshire wondered if hitting the six-month mark and “the downwards slope to winter” was taking its toll. “I was ready to brush it off as irrational,” she said, “until I saw this.”“This” was a  callout on “mid-year burnout”, asking readers to assess their moods and energy levels at this point in 2019 – were they tracking upwards with the mercury? Or were the longer, warmer days not having the positive impact they usually did?It was undeniably, as one reader said, “a self-selecting sample answering a leading question” – but many more saw the words: “Could you be suffering from mid-year burnout?” and responded with an unequivocal yes. Their responses, mostly submitted on condition of anonymity, told of sleep disrupted by lighter evenings, of unusually bad hay fever, of illnesses still lingering after months.Readers wrote of feeling as if they could fall asleep standing up, of waking with a racing heart or clouded mind, of having lost their energy, appetite or libido. They felt stretched too thin, in and out of work. They would go on holiday and spend all day in bed – or come back from holiday and find the positive effects gone after a couple of days. They were regularly surprised to find themselves irritable or tearful. Many said it was as if the joy had been sucked from life.Some were people whose existence was threatened – by debt, poor physical and mental health, underemployment, austerity, hate crimes or insecure work and housing. But even those who should have been thriving, or at least broadly fine, reported an apparent groundswell of malaise.For every reader who scoffed at the premise of mid-year burnout (“a trendy tag for tiredness. What the hell has the calendar got to do with this?”), there were many like Charlotte, a 47-year-old from East Sussex. “I wake up in the morning and think, did I get drunk last night?” she wrote. “And then I remember, no, this is just what normal feels like now. I’m just tired and moody all the time.”I understood, because I felt the same way. Summer was typically the season when everything just flowed, when longer days and warmer nights seemed to make it easier to balance life and work, while making the life part effortlessly more fun.Not this year, though. This year Lana Del Rey’s seven-year-old Summertime Sadness re-entered the US iTunes chart (“Is everyone OK?” fretted a viral tweet). Though I love my job, have no children or mortgage, am in good health and have taken regular holidays, by June it felt as if I was already out of fuel when I thought I’d only just stopped to fill up. The thought of another six months of running on empty seemed both impossible and inevitable.Gina, 33, from Kent, knew just how I felt. “The weekends don’t seem to bring respite at the moment,” she wrote. She and her husband were both “unusually tired and in need of a holiday this year”, despite a good work-life balance and holiday allowance. “I don’t think you would know from looking at us that we feel burned out – we are very active, busy people, with wholesome leisure activities and an active social life. But it all feels like too much.”There were obvious, numerous and very real reasons why people might be struggling. This was different (and, of course, incomparable, in terms of stakes or urgency): fatigue, felt both at a gut and bodily level, and in the atmosphere. Rob, 53, from The Hague, described himself standing in the shower each morning, yawning. He ached to take some time off, “to do nothing but just be”. “It’s like I lifted my head and it’s June already – how did that happen? It was Christmas a few weeks ago, wasn’t it?”There is some psychological significance to the midway point of the year, as a logical opportunity to take stock. People may be reminded of the optimism that they felt in the new year, or the goals that they set and are now no closer to achieving. “I think all the prospects of possible change die down, and it just becomes a slog towards the end so you can start afresh,” said Louise.Parents (and teachers) find themselves beset with demands for end-of-term events such as sports days and performances. “It is like a race to get to the finish line at home and work,” said a 42-year-old mother of two working in higher education in Worcester. “It is worse than December by some distance as there is only a long summer of juggling childcare and work commitments as a reward.”As in the runup to Christmas, social calendars also tend to fill up in summer – and the assumption of a lighter workload and a break is not always borne out. “It seems that it’s not only the onslaught of work, with various people off on holidays and clients wanting everything, even on a Sunday, but the birthdays, parties, gigs, all at once,” said Robert, 35, from Manchester. “It sounds like I’m being ungrateful. I’m not – I’m just utterly drained.”Other readers attributed their low mood and energy levels to the news cycle. Jan, 38, from Edinburgh, said the expectations of picnics, barbecues and socialising were “emotionally incongruous” with the climate emergency, Trump, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and “the Tory leadership nonsense”: “This year more than ever, I want to hide from the world.”Many readers were holding out for autumn, winter, September, November, Christmas – a point in the not-too-distant future when this low ebb would pass, like bad weather. I thought I understood why. It was the same reason that I’d classified my own desperation as being of the mid-year. It was that the alternative was too grim to consider: that this threadbare feeling wasn’t seasonal, tied to longer, warmer days – but our new basal temperature.But Dr Natasha Bijlani, a consultant psychiatrist at the Priory hospital in Roehampton, south-west London, says that is exactly right. “I am sceptical about there being such a thing as mid-year burnout. We do know that there are high levels of burnout in our society in general I think it’s reaching epidemic levels. If you asked people the question in April or September, you could say it was the three-quarter-year burnout.”That doesn’t dismiss the issue rather, it casts it as catastrophic. Any discussion of burnout is valuable when so many people are suffering in silence, says Bijlani. “It allows people to be aware of all the time, not just in the middle of the year.”The World Health Organization clarified in May that it does not consider burnout a medical issue rather, it understands it to be an “occupational phenomenon” resulting from chronic and unmanaged workplace stress. It “should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life”.Definitions serve a purpose – especially when classification as a medical condition paves the way for treatment by medication. But for many, the suggestion that feelings about work can be restricted to “the occupational context” will provoke hollow laughter.Readers wrote, with no small desperation, of the impossibility of keeping their job separate from other areas of their life. A 38-year-old public servant said her husband was supportive, their jobs were rewarding and meaningful, their four children “thriving” – but she was hanging on by a thread. “My husband is exhausted with work too, and every day we say, ‘We can do this – just keep swimming.’ Some days it feels like everything is in its place and this is working other days – like today – it feels like the wheels are coming off.”The fix is not as straightforward as taking time off when that can create more work in the leadup, and another pile on your return (while those who remain take up the slack). Londoner Claire, 35, used to work 60-hour weeks, only able to catch up on sleep and laundry at the weekend. “It always got worse in summer – the bosses would take the full six weeks off work and come back all refreshed, while my ‘holiday’ was the August bank holiday weekend, when I’d go to visit family and I’d crash out from exhaustion.”Bijlani sees only the most severe cases of burnout at the Priory, but she lays the blame with a culture that frames overwork as the norm, and the technology that facilitates it. She urges people to observe strict limits on work, and to put themselves first: if that sounds indulgent, she says, it’s only more evidence of the ridiculous state we’re in. Work-life balance should be for everyone, not just those at the tops of their fields. “I’ve had people come in and say, ‘It’s all right for the CEO to do that, but I can’t,’” says Bijlani. “It needs to filter down.”Siobhan Murray, a resilience coach, psychotherapist and author of The Burnout Solution, says the pressure is built into society – from millennials who have had their worth eroded by competitive but unpaid internships and unstable work (“By the time they’re into their late 20s, they’re already burned out”) to thirtysomethings racing to achieve the “bizarre goal” of retiring by 40.Others took on more obligations, such as caring for their elderly parents, without thinking to let go of others, only realising they were overcommitted when they reached breaking point. Of Murray’s 12 current clients, more than half had been signed off work with burnout on their doctors’ orders – some for as long as two months. “There are degrees of burnout,” she says, “and the average  reader isn’t necessarily at that high end where they’re being signed off or going to the Priory – but they could fast be approaching it.”The discovery that a long-awaited getaway may not be as restorative as you had hoped can be a dismal wake-up call. Shorter, more regular holidays throughout the year can help – she suggests taking a week off every three months.We can dream of the introduction of a universal basic income or four-day working week – but for as long as burnout is the baseline of society, Murray says iniduals must be realistic about the demands on their time. She recommends a regular “life audit”, reassessing commitments or goals to prioritise those that matter. “You can’t hit a gym class in the morning and be a parent and travel with your job and see your friends because there are not enough hours in the day. We spring clean our houses we have to get into the habit of doing that with our selves and our lives.”A more balanced schedule – grounded in inidual priorities and realistic expectations, and protected against every attempt to undermine it – may enable us to feel more in control of our lives, says Murray. “It’s about being able to get into bed every night and say: ‘OK, this didn’t work, but this did, so you know what, I did a good job today.’” More openness about the pressures that many of us are under can help us realise that we are not alone, and seek help when we reach breaking point. “There’s a sense of personal failing to burnout, but it’s not,” says Murray. “Sometimes we just need to be able to say: ‘I’m not coping.’”The people who have successfully safeguarded themselves against burnout have learned to go easy on themselves, and they have defined personal boundaries that they defend against everything the world is going to throw at them. “I can guarantee that those are not people who are never going to get burned out and who just have it all sorted,” says Murray. “They’re the ones who have actually experienced it, and know what they have to pull back on in order to be able to live.” And not just until the autumn.All names except Murray and Bijlani have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b573ae413101877df56421851378ea1d4fe37072/0_343_5148_3089/master/5148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a06c06b65aeeadfff6221fb217ad4ff8","title":"luxury bottled water is absurd so why is it so popular","story":"People pay top dollar for ‘premium’ brands indistinguishable in blind taste tests from tap water – is it about status, wellness or something more fundamental?Last year, judges at the 28th International Berkeley Springs Water Tasting competition deemed the best bottled water in the world to be an Australian brand “infused with the sound frequencies of love, the moon, and light spectrums of the rainbow”.Called Frequency H2O and sold for A$3.30 a liter (US$2.30), the water is, according to its creator Sturt Hinton, an “ultimate elixir of life”. Also recognized by the judges was Svalbarði, a company that sells $90 bottles of water freshly squeezed from – wait for it – melting Norwegian glaciers.The extravagant taglines and price tag make luxury bottled water a sort of liquid climate change for the rich. Despite an abundance of logical reasons to avoid it, the bottled water industry has never been stronger. And “premium” bottled water, the extra-fancy sort touted for “health benefits” like alkalinity, is the fastest-growing sector of the US bottled water industry, itself valued at $18.5bn.Whether such elite products are pumped from 3,000 feet beneath Hawaii or extracted from Fijian springs and sprinkled with gold dust, most justify their inherent excess with a similar refrain: the more obscure the origin, or elaborate the preparation, the healthier, higher quality, and more delicious the water.This, of course, is happening in a context where water scarcity is an accelerating global crisis, predicted to affect two-thirds of the world’s population by 2025. And plastic pollution, to which discarded water bottles contribute immensely, has become an issue so dire experts anticipate that by 2050 the ocean will be filled with more plastic than fish.Also to consider: nothing about bottled water makes it inherently superior to tap. The majority of American tap water is safe, as is essentially all UK tap water, and more closely regulated for contaminants than bottled. In blind taste tests, subjects cannot distinguish between bottled and tap water. And tap water, of course, is nearly free.So why do we buy it? For one, access to rarified waters has been a status symbol for centuries (think the 19th-century leisure-class craze for vacationing in “spa towns” or the devotion of historic European royals to the supposedly salubrious effects of thermal springs).Then there’s the wellness movement, responsible for a collective spurning of alcohol and soda, and promoting a more fervent interest in “luxury” water than ever. Indeed, luxe “water bars” and even vibrational frequency-charged bottled water brands have been making a go of it since at least 2006. Yet the American mainstream has probably never been as receptive of pricey, esoteric health products as during the current late-capitalistic peak wellness moment.And then there might be another reason, according researchers at Ontario’s University of Waterloo. The reason why society is so devoted to bottled water, they say, may be our fear of death.In a recent social-psychological study on water consumption choices, researchers Stephanie Cote and Sarah Wolfe claim, “iniduals’ unacknowledged death anxiety may be an unrecognized barrier to environmentally sustainable behavior change”.“Death reminders reliably increase humans’ selfish exploitation of natural resources,” writes Wolfe in her related work explaining that when humans consider our impending demise, our instinctive denial and need for distraction leads us to make irrational decisions. Such as, perhaps unconsciously, thinking: “How could the planet be dying when I hold in my hand a bottle of such unfathomably pristine water? How could I be dying when I’m making such healthy decisions?”Cote and Wolfe argue that the way that bottled water is marketed – its associations with wellbeing – happen to make it a particularly appealing antidote for existential despair.Take, for instance, Evian’s slogan – “Evian, drink young” – and its advertising’s use of babies to convey youth, or Fiji Water’s claim to be “bottled at the source, untouched by man”, and lush, tropical island imagery. The bottled water industry works hard to make its products look and feel like the opposite of death.But we can change our habits. On a personal level, it’s wise to carry a reusable water bottle – a status symbol in its own right. In their research, Cotes and Wolfe conclude that government pro-tap water campaigns would be more effective by embracing positive messaging about how wellness-enhancing tap water is, rather than harsh truths reminding consumers that plastic equals death. Governments can also enact bans on single-use plastic products, as Canada and the EU have pledged to do.Beyond the sheer extravagance of “premium” water, the central dilemma is that these products ultimately run counter to their own supposed precept: health – of the planet and all its inhabitants. The future may be scary, but it’s high time we wean ourselves from the bottle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d11c627c6f7476f4200952f5871e442b663e838/0_118_1181_708/master/1181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2224ae4d69b178c8a919baea4bd22fc3","title":"beth ditto how we made gossip standing in the way of control bible belt","story":"‘The lyrics came out in a two-minute splurge. I drew on personal experiences, like growing up in the Bible Belt and being labelled a bitch’In the early 2000s, everyone I knew was in a band but none of us dreamed of breaking through. I used to record my vocals in the bathroom and I was really bad at writing lyrics. So we had lots of half-written punk songs.I’d always been scared of writing lyrics but Standing in the Way of Control came out in a two-minute splurge. I drew on personal experiences, such as growing up in the Bible Belt and being labelled a bitch because I wasn’t going to scripture class, and being called weak because things like sexism, racism and homophobia really affected me. My size was more of an issue then too. I wasn’t bullied at school or anything – I was outgoing and popular – but I’d ask myself: “Why do people think like this?”I guess everyone can relate to the title, the idea of resisting control. It wasn’t just my gay friends who were having dark times. The economy was shit and people were struggling. We were called a gay band, a queer band, a riot grrrl band, but we were just working-class kids and people connected with our song.So many people have told me, “That song got me through ninth grade”, which makes me very happy. Sadly, the song’s as relevant now as ever, and the friend who I wrote it for is having the same crisis once again.We wrote this song in our drummer, Kathy Mendonça’s basement. We were just jamming and I had this disco guitar riff in my mind. Beth’s lyrics filled in the spaces. A band in a basement is a good, simple, organic way for a song to be born.Kathy had a very simple, primal, garage-rock way of drumming, like Moe Tucker from the Velvet Underground. When she left to pursue a degree, Hannah Billie stepped in, using the hi-hat cymbal – and the song just came alive. We recorded it at Bear Creek with Guy Picciotti from Fugazi – a big hero of ours. It was our first time in a real studio but they let us be ourselves. It was still pretty DIY.By then, we’d been playing at being rock stars for years. I first met Beth when we were 13, in Arkansas, and I put her band’s music out on my little cassette tape label. The Bible Belt has some lovely people but can be oppressive when you’re a young punk rocker with a crazy haircut or blue hair. People used to chase us around town.Standing in the Way of Control turned us from outcasts into a mainstream band. The Soulwax remix ended up on the soundtrack for TV series Skins, which was huge in the UK at the time. Beth won NME’s cool Person of the Year award and was loved because of who she is. Everything just started rolling for us. We went on the Jonathan Ross Show. We were driving to another show when we heard our song on the radio for the first time. Everyone went: “Waaaaaah!”I think we handled our British success pretty well. No one became an egomaniacal rock star asshole and we didn’t turn into Oasis and beat each other up. We played some wild shows that felt like Stooges concerts. Then it was nice to come back to America where nobody cared about us and everything was back to normal.• The UK leg of Gossip’s tour celebrating the 10th anniversary of their album Music for Men starts on 19 July in Glasgow.

As on The Great Gatsby and Moulin Rouge! before it, Martin will also serve as production and costume designer. Production is to begin early next year, with filming taking place in Queensland, Australia.Butler, who has a role in Jim Jarmusch’s The Dead Don’t Die, has also been cast in Quentin Tarantino’s upcoming Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, set in 1960s Los Angeles and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c02472062070f107f6bcebf07ee7cc2a764a962/0_0_14473_8684/master/14473.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3c06fa898ca329a44ae1dad7ad7c1ed","title":"euthanasia and assisted dying rates are soaring but where are they legal","story":"It is available in a growing number of countries and jurisdictions – but not the UK, where it remains outlawed“The main difference between euthanasia and assisted suicide is who performs the final, fatal act,” said Richard Huxtable, professor of medical ethics and law at the University of Bristol.Euthanasia refers to active steps taken to end someone’s life to stop their suffering and the “final deed” is undertaken by someone other than the inidual, for example a doctor. If the person concerned has requested this, it falls under the term “voluntary euthanasia”.Assisted suicide is about helping someone to take their own life at their request – in other words the final deed is undertaken by the person themselves. Assisted dying can be used to mean both euthanasia, generally voluntary, and assisted suicide however, some campaign groups use it to refer only to assisted suicide of terminally ill people.“One of the dilemmas we have in these ongoing debates is how people use the various phrases,” says Huxtable. Most, but not all, jurisdictions that allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide require the involvement of medical professionals.Palliative sedation, in which people can request to be kept under deep sedation until they die, is allowed in many countries, including the Netherlands and France – is not euthanasia.The Netherlands and Switzerland are the most well known, and Belgium considered perhaps the most liberal, but several other jurisdictions allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide. That said, permitted circumstances differ considerably.In the Netherlands both euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if the patient is enduring unbearable suffering and there is no prospect of improvement. Anyone from the age of 12 can request this, but parental consent is required if a child is under 16. There are a number of checks and balances, including that doctors must consult with at least one other, independent doctor on whether patient meets the necessary criteria.Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada and Colombia also allow both euthanasia and assisted suicide, although there are differences – for example only terminal patients can request it in Colombia, while Belgium has no age restriction for children (although they must have a terminal illness).Again, the exact circumstances in which assisted suicide is allowed vary, with some jurisdictions – Oregon and Vermont – only allowing it in the case of terminal illness. For some places it is permitted not because laws have been passed, but because laws do not prohibit it. For example in Switzerland it is an offence to assist a suicide if it is done with selfish motives. “The result of that is there is this growth of not-for-profit organisations,” says Prof Penney Lewis, an expert on the law around end-of-life care at King’s College London.Other countries, including New Zealand, are considering legalising some form of euthanasia.Euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal. Euthanasia can lead to a murder charge and assisted suicide could result in a sentence of up to 14 years in prison.It is not normally illegal for a patient to be given treatment to relieve distress that could indirectly shorten life – but this is not euthanasia. It is already legal in the UK for patients to refuse treatment, even if that could shorten their life, and for medical care to be withdrawn by doctors in certain cases, for example where a patient is in a vegetative state and will not recover (sometimes controversially called passive euthanasia).Total figures from around the world are hard to collate. Figures from Switzerland show that the numbers of those living in the country who underwent assisted suicide rose from 187 in 2003 to 965 in 2015.Agnes van der Heide, professor of decision-making and care at the end of life at the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, says the reason euthanasia is more common than assisted suicide in the Netherlands is multifaceted. Doctors may feel that by performing the deed themselves they can have more control over dosages and the time the procedure takes.“Patients are often in a very advanced stage of their disease where it is practically difficult if not impossible to drink the lethal drink they have to take when they chose for assistance in suicide,” she adds. “It is a very bitter-tasting drink and it is quite an effort to drink it until the end,” she added. There might also be an element of viewing the act as a medical procedure and hence preferring a physician to do the job.Lewis says the vast majority of people do not end their lives by euthanasia even if they can. “There is far more withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, even in jurisdictions that permit euthanasia,” she says.Noa Pothoven, who was 17, died last month – she had anorexia and severe depression. At first media reports suggested she had been “legally euthanised”, but later reports said it was unclear how she died, with her friends releasing a comment saying that she died after she stopped eating and drinking.Van der Heide said that while she could not comment on Pothoven’s case, it is possible for minors over the age of 12 to seek euthanasia or assisted suicide in the Netherlands, under certain conditions.In some places, yes. According to van der Heide, while suicide tourism is not formally forbidden in the Netherlands, physicians must work with the patient to establish that they meet certain criteria. “I think if a physician would provide euthanasia to a patient he doesn’t know then it is very likely that the regional committee would have a problem with that,” she says.However, people do travel to Switzerland for assisted suicide. According to statistics from Dignitas, 221 people travelled to the country for this purpose in 2018, 87 of whom were from Germany, 31 from France and 24 from the UK.Euthanasia and assisted suicide have proved contentious among doctors. Some argue that support for such ideas goes against the commitment to “do no harm”. Others say some people might choose not to end their life if they are made aware that they could be made comfortable with good end of life care.“Some health professionals are familiar with the care of dying patients and with what palliative care can do – so they may have a feeling that assisted dying isn’t always necessary ,” says Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford. “All the criteria and also the practice of euthanasia is mainly shaped by how physicians feel it should be,” says van der Heide. “I think for the typical patient with end-stage cancer and severe unbearable suffering, there is hardly any physician in the Netherlands who thinks that the issue of harming patients is at stake there.”That depends how you look at it. Support for the Dutch laws clearly remains high, but some say there are signs of a “slippery slope”, with the practice being applied too widely.However as Huxtable points out, other jurisdictions including Oregon show that broadening of use is not inevitable. “The fact there has been some slide in the Netherlands should give everyone reason to pause,” he says. “We should think right form the outset what do we think in principle is defensible and are we going to – and we should – police the boundaries.”There have also been allegations of malpractice. In 2018 both the Netherlands and Belgium reported their first cases in which doctors were investigated for possibly breaching the laws, with three more investigations under way in the Netherlands involving the euthanasia of psychiatric patients.“Nowadays there are more controversial cases, so the likelihood that there now will be cases that do not fulfil the criteria to the extent that the public prosecutor thinks it is necessary to install a criminal procedure is more likely than it used to be,” says van der Heide.There have been concerns by disabilities groups that as euthanasia and assisted suicide become more common, it could put a pressure on those living with non-terminal conditions to end their lives. But van der Heide says doctors in the Netherlands take great care when dealing with requests to make sure patients meet strict requirements, and turn down those who do not.She adds that the development of laws to allow euthanasia or assisted dying must be handled carefully. “I indeed acknowledge that having a system in which euthanasia is an option should be really carefully monitored and researched because it in principle involves the risk of life of vulnerable people being regarded as less worthy or more prone to doctors’ assistance in dying,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab91bd2558f894d2d4188fcd8cd1410bc4384f03/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a29a2ca771a650f53b83ed592de24","title":"stop and search is ineffective so why is it on the rise podcast","story":"The first stop and search Jamal ever experienced was when he was 11 years old.

Indeed, later in his career Turing wrote a seminal paper explaining how patterns such as spots and stripes can appear during chemical reactions.While the importance of Turing’s work and the foundations he laid have become increasingly apparent with time, so too have his personal struggles. These have been highlighted in a biography and a number of plays in the 1980s, as well as the 2014 film The Imitation Game, in which Turing was played by Benedict Cumberbatch.Born in London in 1912, Turing joined Sherborne school at 13. His reports suggest his abilities were mixed, but hint at his imagination and originality. “He must remember that Cambridge will want sound knowledge rather than vague ideas,” his physics teacher wrote.Turing joined King’s College, Cambridge, in 1931 and became a fellow there in 1935. What followed were a number of seminal ideas, including his vision of a universal computing machine, which can be fed an algorithm for a particular computation and then apply it. It was an idea that was to be pivotal in the development of the computers we use today.After a stint at Princeton University in America, Turing returned to the UK, where he worked in code-breaking. With the outbreak of war, he joined Bletchley Park.As a gay man in the early 1950s, at a time when homosexual acts were illegal, Turing faced a demeaning choice when a burglary at his home brought Turing’s relationship with a man to police attention.He was found guilty of gross indecency and had to decide between going to prison or undergoing chemical castration. He chose the latter, a horrifying treatment that involved hormonal injections.Turing died in June 1954, aged 41, at his home in Wilmslow, near Manchester, in an apparent suicide. On Christmas Eve in 2013, the Queen signed a posthumous pardon for him.Turing’s legacy lives on in the machines we take for granted every day, with his name also linked to burgeoning advances. The best known of these is the benchmark Turing test for whether a machine that can think like a human, which hinges on whether human judges can distinguish a computer’s text answers from those given by a person."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c75660ef976f3730ada8d62033aaf2e443703d2/0_543_3345_2006/master/3345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d7aaba15b00ff8ee1431749ff34ba4","title":"did you solve it cheese cube nibbles","story":"The solutions to today’s problems - with cheesy pics!Earlier today I set you the following four puzzles:1. You have a cube of cheese that measures 3 x 3 x 3 inches, and you want to slice it into 27 smaller 1 x 1 x 1 inch cubes, as shown below. If you have a straight knife, what’s the minimum number of slices you need to do it? You are allowed to rearrange the pieces after each slice.Does it make any difference if you have a really, really elastic cheese?With a rigid cheese, the minimum number of slices is 6, which are the slices along the dotted lines in the picture. That’s two through each set of parallel faces. Consider it this way: if you are going to cut the cube into 27 smaller ‘subcubes’, these subcubes will be the 9 on the bottom horizontal slice, the 9 on the middle horizontal slice and the 9 on the top horizontal slice. The subcube in the centre of the middle slice will require six slices, because it has six faces, and each of these faces will need to be cut from a different slice. (All the other subcubes have once face that is part of an external face of the original cube, so these subcubes require less slices. But the middle one requires six).In the case of a really, really elastic cheese, if it were possible to fold the cube over, so that one slice could cut two faces (These faces would be parallel once the cheese was unfolded), then theoretically you only need three slices: one slice for each set of parallel faces. You would need to fold the cheese over in three different (perpendicular) ways for each of these slices. Messy!2. A cube of cheese is ided into 27 identical smaller ‘subcubes’, as above. A mouse starts at one of the corner subcubes and eats his way through the cheese (without ever passing through the same subcube more than once.) Whatever subcube the mouse is in, it can only move into a subcube that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to it.Show a path through the cheese that passes through every subcube and ends in the centre subcube, or prove that such a path is impossible.It’s impossible. Imagine that the 27 subcubes are coloured as in a 3-d chequerboard, so every white cube is vertically and horizontally adjacent only to black cubes, and vice versa. Let the corner sub cubes all be black. The cube thus contains 14 black sub cubes, and 13 white sub cubes. The centre subcube will be white.If the mouse can only travel horizontally or vertically, the subcubes it travels through must alternate black and white. So if the first cube visited is black, every odd-numbered cube it visits will be black, and every even-numbered cube will be white. It is therefore impossible for the 27th cube to be white, so the (white) centre cube cannot be the final cube visited.3. A cheese cube is sitting on a horizontal table. If you slice it in half by making a vertical cut, midway between, and parallel to, two of the sides, the cross section of the cut will be a square.How do you slice a cube into two equal parts, such that the cross-section of the slice is a hexagon?The fact you can get a hexagon out of a cube is a lovely surprise. You cut it like this:Reader Rachel Baker made one out of butter (she had ran out of cheese):4. How do you slice a cube of cheese into six pieces of identical volume with only three cuts?The most pleasing symmetrical method is to cut down the diagonals, as Rachel Baker demonstrates here with a cube of parmigiano reggiano. Slice 1 is vertical from the diagonal on the top face to the diagonal on the bottom face.Slices 2 and three are between the diagonals on other pairs of faces. Each of the three diagonals needs to meet at one of the vertices of the cube.The six pieces are all tetrahedrons – four-sided objects where each side is a triangle, in this case isoceles triangles. The pieces have identical volume but are not identical, coming in two orientations. Rachel’s impressively neat slicing earns her today’s prize of one of my books. Rachel’s is not the only solution.

Spread out in the right places on Mars, the sheets would warm the ground and melt enough subsurface ice to keep plants alive.Robin Wordsworth, who worked on the sheets at Harvard University, said: “If we want to make sustainable habitats on another planet using present-day technology, this approach could be very useful. It’s completely scalable, so the area covered could be anywhere from a few square metres to large regions of the planet.”Should humans ever decide to spread beyond Earth, as the late Stephen Hawking declared we must, then growing food on alien worlds will be a skill that has to be mastered. But on Mars the conditions are hardly conducive. The planet is frigid and dry and bombarded by radiation, the soil contains potentially toxic chemicals and the wispy atmosphere is low on nitrogen.In the past, scientists and science fiction writers have proposed “terraforming” barren worlds, an approach that calls for the whole atmosphere to be rebuilt. In 1971 the American astronomer Carl Sagan suggested that vaporising the northern polar ice cap on Mars might release enough water into the atmosphere to do the trick. More modest ideas have involved erecting greenhouses instead.The aerogel sheets do not solve all of the problems but they could help future spacefarers create fertile oases on desolate planets where plants and other photosynthesising organisms can take root. Because life would only grow beneath the sheets, the risk of contaminating the rest of Mars with foreign lifeforms would be minimal, Wordsworth said.“Placing silica aerogel shields over sufficiently ice-rich regions of the Martian surface could therefore allow photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent intervention,” the researchers wrote in Nature Astronomy. The sheets could be laid directly on the ground to grow algae and aquatic plants, or suspended to provide room for land plants to grow beneath them.Wordsworth said: “The best place to try this is similar to where you’d want to land humans: at mid-latitudes where sunlight levels are still relatively high, but where it’s close enough to the polar caps that near-surface ice deposits are still scattered around.“You can imagine this being used in a number of ways. The most achievable in the short term would be a small-scale test with a robotic lander. In the longer term it could be used in support of human exploration missions, and eventually to produce long-lived habitats that you would aim to make as self-sustaining as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10541d22facbcaadfefece21f39b888f9d9d88e2/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d63ecf7871a3ea01e5897b1ea2c07c6","title":"how has the menopause affected you share you experiences","story":"We’d like to find out what sort of support you have had at work or home and what if anything has helped symptoms? The menopause – when a woman’s fertile period comes to an end – can be a traumatic time for many women. The drop in hormone levels can introduce both physical and mental symptoms that can have a significant impact on quality of life. Some women find symptoms so overwhelming that they even think about quitting their jobs.The writer, Rose George has shared her own experiences of the menopause in a  article where she also raised the question why so little is known about it: “I woke up fatigued, stinking and angry that something so common, something that affects millions of women, is still such a medical mystery. Why do we get hot flushes? We don’t know. Why is sleep broken? We don’t know. Why are we the only creatures to get menopause apart from two types of whales? We don’t know.”Not everyone experiences problems with the menopause and many say that it can be a liberating time for women.The menopause affects women in myriad ways and we’d like to find out about your experiences.

The last operation, during which they were finally separated, was carried out on 11 February.The girls, who were born by caesarean section, were craniopagus twins, with their skulls and blood vessels fused together. GOSH has previously successfully separated craniopagus twins in 2006 and 2011.In order to ensure the operations went smoothly, experts used virtual reality to create an exact replica of the girls’ anatomies. This enabled surgeons to visualise the complex structure of their skulls as well as the positioning of their brains and blood vessels.A team also used 3D printing to create plastic models of the structures that could be used for practice. Cutting guides were created so that surgeons could work more precisely.During the surgery, doctors first worked to separate the girls’ blood vessels and then inserted a piece of plastic into their heads to keep the brains and blood vessels apart. Scans had shown that the girls have two distinct brains but these are misshapen, which the plastic and an accompanying pulley system helped to correct.During further surgery, the girls started to bleed after clots formed in Safa’s neck veins and she began to shunt blood to her twin. Doctors were concerned they might lose Marwa during the operation after her heart rate fell. As a result of her complications, they gave her a key vein that the twins shared. But this had an impact on Safa, who had a stroke less than 12 hours later due to the loss of the vein.The final major operation involved medics building new skulls using the girls’ own bone. They also used tissue expanders to ensure each girl’s skin would stretch over the top of her head.The surgery, which was paid for by a private donor, has been followed by several smaller procedures to enable the girls to live independent lives. The operations added up to more than 50 hours of surgery time and involved 100 members of GOSH staff.The girls’ mother, Zainab Bibi, 34, said: “We are indebted to the hospital and to the staff and we would like to thank them for everything they have done. We are extremely excited about the future.”The girls, whose father died of a heart attack while their mother was pregnant with them, were discharged from GOSH on 1 July and moved to a London address with their mother, their grandfather Mohammad Sadat and an uncle, Mohammad Idrees. They are undergoing daily physiotherapy as part of their rehabilitation.Neurosurgeon Noor Ul Owase Jeelani and craniofacial surgeon Prof David Dunaway led the team that operated on the girls. They said in a statement: “We are delighted we have been able to help Safa and Marwa and their family. It has been a long and complex journey for them … Their faith and determination have been so important in getting them through the challenges they have faced. We are incredibly proud of them.“We are also incredibly proud of the GOSH team responsible for their treatment and care over the past 10 months. GOSH really is one of the few hospitals in the world with the infrastructure and expertise to carry out a separation like this successfully.”Conjoined twins are very rare – affecting only about one in every 2.5m births."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0366fc0dbe0b0f5532b3b1d6bf1ccd55c0258b31/0_192_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=490c2c1e8f9ab30edb3e14d1a132d805","title":"ben stokes redemption story world cup tour de force","story":"Ben Stokes: remember the name. This World Cup was always billed as a moment to refresh and start over, a chance to straighten the mistakes of the recent past. It is a process that works on the micro as well as the macro level.For a long time Sunday’s final at Lord’s was an occasion looking for a shape to fit, a genre to follow. As England restricted New Zealand’s batsmen it must have felt for the home crowd like a summer comedy, a jaunt destined for the inevitable happy ending. As England fumbled and stalled in mid-afternoon it seemed like something else: a saga, an epic, perhaps even, as wickets began to fall, a horror story.By the end it had changed again. Enter Stokes, pursued by the past. Watching that inked and grizzled figure at the crease, crouched low, bat raised like a polo mallet, it was clear even through the fog of endless turning points that we were watching something else. This was instead a redemption story.Sport loves a grand storyline, loves to cast itself as a swooping operetta, when often it is little more than bad art in coloured clothing. But for Stokes a performance that involved straining every fibre of muscle and talent and will, capped with a medal and a man of the match award, represents a genuine catharsis.This is a cricketer who has suffered in the public eye, excessively so. It will be a year next month since Stokes was cleared of affray after being involved in a late- night brawl outside the dreaded Mbargo while on England duty. It was a witless, graceless moment of folly. But Stokes has paid a price.These, his peak years, have been shadowed by that incident. For a while, a careworn Stokes emerged, so desperate to repay his team that he seemed to suppress the spark of violent elan that makes him so captivating.He is at his best when he is at his most physical, when it seems his entire body is caught up in the moment. That vital six over midwicket off Trent Boult in the final over at Lord’s was a brilliant snapshot of a man feeling the moment in his limbs, his tendons, his blood. As Boult released the ball Stokes was already down hugging the ground, front foot shuffled on to off stump, bat coming through in the full arc and almost touching between his shoulder blades in his follow through.Some players address the ball with their bat face or with their wrists. Some throw the kitchen sink at it. Ben Stokes throws Ben Stokes at it.It is an instinct that would repay him later in that flukish deflection as he ed to make his ground. And the same quality was there in Kolkata too, the night Stokes just kept trying to bowl a yorker to Carlos Brathwaite and Brathwaite just kept on hitting him over the rope. No pulling back, no quarter. This has been a Stokes theme.Probably expectation always hung a little heavily. Aged 14, Stokes was already a schoolboy star, hobnobbing with Joe Root at the Bunbury festival and rising through the levels with thrilling assurance. Aged 21, he already had five first-class hundreds, the first Englishman to do that so young since Denis Compton. That startlingly brutal 258 in Cape Town the more brilliant century at Perth against one of the great Australian pace attacks: these were glimpses of a genuine A-list talent.Fine moments but there were others, ones that left him bruised. It felt as if Sunday was coming. Stokes had already had a fine World Cup. He ended up with the ninth-highest run total. He bowled briskly. He fielded with righteous fury and took that bravura catch in the deep on the opening day at the Oval, a catch that also seemed to involve reaching back into the past, behind him, plucking the ball out of some other timeline.Lord’s can be a heavy kind of place and batting was tough. In the early morning Henry Nicholls, a fine Test player, had looked as if he had won a raffle to open in a World Cup final. Later, Jofra Archer bowled a series of vicious bouncers at Colin de Grandhomme, who took the ball bravely on helmet, shoulder and chest. A sure sign summer is here: the sound of leather on De Grandhomme.It lasted through the day. Some bowlers make the ball talk. Boult had it burbling in fluent Etruscan as England’s innings began. It was time to bat with some heart and soul, to bat in the deeper gears, something Stokes has been working on all year as though in silent preparation.Jos Buttler was more fluent as England’s two most explosive batsmen produced a vital, hard‑bitten partnership, but he also hit one up in the air just as they got close.And really it had to be Stokes. Another end note, another moment of jeopardy. There were two dot balls at the start of Boult’s final over. Suddenly England needed 15 off four. Not again. Stokes wandered away and thrashed at the air with his bat, frustrated but not raging. Then came that full-body launch over midwicket. Then came the moment that settled the tournament.Again Stokes was all in, throwing himself at the crease as he hared back to make his ground for a second run. Again something comical and even quite cruel happened. Except this time it happened to somebody else. The deflection off Stokes’s bat to take the ball to the pavilion boundary was a moment of outrageous luck. But not quite dumb luck. Stokes knew where the ball was coming from. He was quick enough and brave enough to throw himself full length, not stopping, not taking a breath, taking England with him towards that glorious end.What happens from here is wide open. Stokes will be 32 when the next World Cup comes round. Before then there is a chance to make a little more Ashes impact and to become a founding star of that strange new beast The Hundred. He has his moment now. Something has lifted: Bristol, Kolkata, the sense of a player with a long dark cloud following him. Stokes 3.0, the post-redemption years, might well be the best bit of this story.

But the final probably shades it, if only for the fact it was a complete mind-bending LSD trip of cricketing lunacy.EJ Clearly the last one. But West Indies v New Zealand ran it close – it also had more dynamic inidual performances, a see-sawing narrative, multiple Sheldon Cottrell salutes and a lot more sixes than the final.TA The final: the greatest match in the history of one-day cricket, if not all cricket, with heartbreak and joy ided only by the number of boundaries.

That ability to hold their nerve was utterly astonishing.VM Bangladesh.

Laughable stuff, really.BR The format is wrong. World Cups need at least three knockout rounds. Take a hit on the guaranteed Indian TV money. They’ll still be there to the end anyway.EJ That most people in the UK had little idea their country was hosting a Cricket World Cup until the final. Sky’s generous agreement to share coverage on free-to-air TV was too little too late.TA The tournament’s half-arsed attitude to sustainability.

So does my view of the best one. Currently, I favour 14 teams, two groups of seven, a passage to the semi-final for the group winners, “quarter-finals” for the other four qualifying teams.

Especially if the whisky is Royal Stag.AM Would be head-to-head results between sides before net run-rate in the hierarchy of tie-breakers for the group table(s).

And as for the cricketarist … I will look for you. I will find you … And I will kill you.EJ I’d like to see the cricketarist replaced by musical entertainment that’s both musical and entertains. And less American-style forced fun on the big screens between overs – no one needs snack cam, or Lord’s trying to Make It Large.TA Other than get it on free-to-air TV … ensure that the scoreboards do what they say they’ll do. Too often they were plastered with adverts at crucial times – irritating for regulars, hopeless for new fans.VM … not be accustomed to 50-over cricket since none of the best ones will have played this format in county cricket for four years. It’s been a grand tournament, but the ECB has relegated the 50-over game it becomes developmental and peripheral from now onwards. However, if they reduce matches to 100 balls per side in 2023 the rest of the world had better watch out.AB … keep getting bowled out in 16.4 overs because all their players will have spent the past four years playing in The Hundred?AM … probably still be in decent shape given the ages of those currently in the team and some very good players of spin. With domestic 50-over cricket set to become second-class, it’s further down the line where you worry.BR … have a completely different team. Only Archer in the current one is under 28. The top three will be 33 or 32 and the best bowler from the final will be 38. The question is whether there’s a layer of talent waiting to come through. The back-up batting here suggests it’s quite a big question.EJ … have some World Cup winners in their team. And that’s a first.TA … not be able to top that.

One thing no one has ever recommended, though, is the remedy the ECB concocted for their World Cup-winning team, which involved a meet-and-greet with hundreds of screaming primary‑school children on the outfield at the Oval, a round of press and TV interviews and then, to cap it all off, a swift hair-of-the-dog with Theresa May at No 10 Downing Street. Watching the players come stumbling downstairs from the dressing room at 11 in the morning, the drinkers among them conspicuous by their sunglasses, it looked less like a party than it did a punishment.When Sri Lanka won the World Cup in 1996 their captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, lost the cheque he had just been presented with at the victory ceremony because someone pickpocketed it from him during the pitch invasion. This time one wondered, for a minute, whether Eoin Morgan was going to lose the World Cup trophy when he disappeared beneath a wave of over‑excited schoolchildren, who started climbing all over him, and each other, to get at it. At one point one of the bigger kids seemed to have wrenched the cup away from him, before someone wisely decided that maybe they should hurry the thing back indoors again.The players stuck it out for another 10 minutes before someone snapped and the stewards decided to kettle all the kids in a far corner. After that the players took a quarter-lap of honour in front of the few hundred adults who had come down to the ground after the ECB put out an invitation by email late on Sunday night.There is no point in lying, it seemed a fairly strange, subdued and chaotic way to celebrate one of the great sporting achievements. In 2005, when England regained the Ashes, they marked it with an open-topped bus parade and a party in Trafalgar Square that pulled in almost a quarter of a million. This time, aside from the kids, they had perhaps a quarter of a thousand.“A very different celebration compared to the one in 2005,” said Ashley Giles, who was involved in both, that one as a player, this as England’s director of cricket. “But the guys coming down here, sharing it with these kids, things like this are how you inspire future generations.”It felt almost as if the ECB had spent so long planning how to win this World Cup, hiring Trevor Bayliss, rejigging their central contract system, rearranging the county schedules, that they had not stopped to think about what they would do if they did. It turned out that the children were all going to be here anyway for an event that had been arranged by Surrey. They had decided a couple of months ago to throw an after-the-Cup cricket carnival for kids from the local schools and clubs and England were piggybacking on that. The ECB approached them two weeks ago and asked if the team could come along to join in with them.Silly as it all was, it felt sweet and fitting, too, a small new beginning for a sport that has been in slow decline for the past 14 years, ever since the ECB first shut it away behind a paywall on Sky TV. Amazing as Sunday’s game was, one day on free-to-air TV is not going to fix that. There is a long way to go but maybe here, among all these kids in their blue baseball caps waving their plastic bats and going crazy for their new heroes, screaming, shouting, clamouring, yammering over Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid and the rest of them, there were the seeds of the revival.Joe Root seemed to think so. “It shows it’s a growing game and we’re doing everything we can to widen the reach of it,” he said. “As a team we talk a lot about how we want to leave the game in a better place when we finish. And I feel like the way we’ve gone about things in this World Cup has, hopefully, done that, like we’ve given these children an opportunity to see what we’ve achieved and want to go on and emulate it for themselves. I was 14 years old when I watched that 2005 Ashes series and it was hugely inspiring for me. Hopefully, we can do something similar for the next generation now.”There are questions whether the ECB’s new competition, The Hundred, which will dominate the 2020 season, is going to be the best way to build on whatever surge of interest the sport enjoys this summer. But its CEO, Tom Harrison, did not want to front up and answer them right now, even though he was milling around on the outfield.Giles did, though. “It is how it is,” he said, when he was asked how he felt that 50-over cricket was going to be marginalised next season. “Next year is really exciting and our focus will move towards 20-over cricket much more, because there are two T20 World Cups coming up, so for us having the preparation period of playing the T20 Blast and The Hundred is probably much more suited for what we’re taking on. And wouldn’t it be great if we could go and win that, too?”Who knows, if they do, maybe the ECB will throw a proper party for them, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6080317fd1231d1feaf8447c1a51a3f000c6551c/0_128_3767_2260/master/3767.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b68efe0ca0f58f7c88ef0d7ce5ed477e","title":"england jamaica netball world cup match report","story":"England have announced their intention to have fun at this World Cup, and now – for a few days at least – they truly can. This defeat of Jamaica here in Liverpool has effectively secured them a semi-final spot, in their first of this week’s matches. For Jamaica, however, it was almost certainly the end of the dream – after their surprise defeat to South Africa on Sunday it will be the first time since 1995 that they have not made it into the knockout rounds.That is a major blow for a team who came into this tournament ranked second in the world and with great expectations of their first trophy in 15 attempts. Still, their captain, Jhaniele Fowler, took a deep breath and a philosophical stance. “We’re devastated, we’re disappointed because we wanted to go further,” she said. “But what can we do? We’re not going to kill ourselves.”Jamaica went toe-to-toe with England throughout the first half, pulling back every time their opponents began to pull away. They even held the lead, briefly, in the second quarter, in a game where bodies regularly bounced off each other and fell to the ground – especially around England’s shooting circle, where Jamaica’s prodigious young defender Shamera Sterling tried to make life hard for the veteran combination of Jo Harten and Helen Housby.An even more crucial fight was happening at the other end, where Geva Mentor took on Fowler. If England’s goalkeeper – the best defender in the world – could not keep her rival away from the posts, then no one could.At 6ft 6in, Fowler is always an imposing figure on court in most games although it is also fair to say she is not a player who exerts unnecessary energy. While Mentor fluttered around her, or flew out of the circle to effect flying intercepts on an unsuspecting wing defence, the Jamaican waited patiently.Under the posts, however, she is a stone-cold killer. Her arm reached so close to the net that she popped balls in as if she was casually putting cans away on her kitchen shelf – and yet she could still seem unhappy with the result. She said afterwards that if she looked frustrated, it was at herself, but that was surely a kindness to her teammates. She did not miss a single shot – 43 in total. Jamaica were always on the fightback, having started scrappily, but England were making their own mistakes and by the end of the first quarter there was just a goal between the sides. It was only after half-time that Jamaica’s defence began to crumble against England’s relentless midfield pressure, Serena Guthrie hassling Nicole Dixon at centre.Harten paid tribute to Sterling, the 24-year-old who has become famed in the game for her intercepts, but England handled that threat well and there were few of her tricks on display. Instead, it was Harten who pulled off magical feats, popping up in spaces that had not existed seconds previously as if she should be accompanied by a puff of smoke.Guthrie, the England captain, said: “If we’d lost to Jamaica the pressure would have been on. We now can afford to do things like rest people, mix up combos and work on some new things.”She barely needed to add that they also plan to enjoy the tournament more.Northern Ireland began their second round with their second close defeat in two days, after Malawi closed them out with an impressive display in the final 15 minutes of a tough-fought game.Dan Ryan, the coach, said his side would keep their disappointment in perspective and that Northern Ireland had “showed a sense of character” after an emotional two-goal defeat to Zimbabwe on Sunday. “It was about how you show up and stand up. We rode a contest against a great side. We needed to tweak a few things, but it was about a response and we responded beautifully.”There was disappointment, too, for Scotland, who lost to South Africa – who remain unbeaten in this tournament – by 28 goals. The Thistles have struggled to find consistency in their play and on Wednesday face Jamaica, who will be playing for pride, and their stated goal of a top-eight finish is ebbing away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef1ceeb5e67fe4d65278cd507b8113d8f0426ba2/0_260_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=099684175125ecaaa6bc3ef17bf5385e","title":"novak djokovic age number roger federer","story":"Any reasonable analysis of the 2019 Wimbledon men’s singles final – as opposed to the fan letters that drive fringes of the tennis media – would surely conclude that Novak Djokovic will finish his career with more majors than Roger Federer but a bucket less of love.It must have been difficult for the world No 1 to endure the disrespect of large swaths of the Centre Court crowd on Sunday, emboldened by Pimm’s and their one-eyed adoration for the Swiss, cheering Djokovic’s every mistake, of which there were too many, and occasionally acknowledging his indomitable spirit.He and all of Federer’s rivals have become so used to it that blocking it out is an art. Djokovic revealed after they had locked egos in a labour of lungs stretched out over nearly five hours that the cries of “Roger! Roger!” that accompanied his every move he internalised as “Novak! Novak!”It was quite an admission from a proud professional athlete who has been the best player in the world – apart from enforced spells because of injury – for most of the past five or six years. As it stands, his fifth Wimbledon title, and third final win there over Federer, brings him up to 16 slam titles, only four short of the eminent Swiss, whose greatness was assured a long time ago but who, rising 38, might not be competing at the very highest level for more than another year or so.At the Champions’ Dinner at London’s Guildhall on Sunday night Djokovic gave eloquent expression to his immediate and long-term aims. It was obvious he wants to overtake Federer and keep Rafael Nadal in his sights (the 33-year-old Spaniard has 18 majors) and will be deflected from that task only if he decides to walk away from the game to spend more time with his family.When he was reminded that he now has as many Wimbledon titles as Björn Borg, he smiled – perhaps wondering silently if his ambitions were greater than that.“It’s a privilege and an honour to be mentioned alongside Björn Borg, one of the greats in this game, for myself, Roger, Rafa and the players of his generation,” the champion told the gathering. “Wimbledon is a special tournament in my eyes, in my dreams, and for many other players. I’m honoured to be in the same room as Rod Laver and Manuel Santana, everyone who has made history for this sport, made it possible for us to compete in such a wonderful sport, to be recognised as a successful athlete.“I am 32 now, though I don’t really look at age. It’s just a number – like Roger said. I think I have a few more years left in my legs. And, if everything goes the right way, if I manage to balance things out in my private life – because I’m a tennis player, obviously, but firstly I’m a father and a husband – and as long as I have the support of the closest people in my life, I am able to thrive.“If I get to compete, it will always be at the highest level and the intention is always to win Wimbledon.”So, remarked the evening’s master of ceremonies, Todd Woodbridge (who won nine Wimbledon doubles finals among his 16 slam titles), “I think you have heard it here first. He is after the record.”Djokovic smiled before saying: “In a matter of words, yes.”Yet for long stretches of an astonishing final he looked anything but a potential champion. His range was off, his movement surprisingly awkward and his power in the shot diminished. Nor did he serve that well, as he admitted later.It is likely this was the accumulated baggage of another tough fortnight, even if he was rarely in trouble in the preceding six matches. But any best-of-five match on grass takes it out of even the very best players.Indeed Federer, in his semi-final against Nadal two days earlier, clearly sacrificed the second set to recharge his weary legs – and it worked, as he found the inspiration and stamina to win in four sets in just over three hours.Sunday’s trial was altogether different. It looks statistically bizarre that nearly all the numbers fell in Federer’s favour, yet he lost the match, the first slam championship to be decided by the new 12-all, fifth-set tie-break.Federer lost all three tie-breaks and could not convert two match points on serve at 8-7 in the fifth, despite out-hitting Djokovic off the ground and in the serve.He put 25 aces past the Serb, probably the best defender in the game over the past decade. Djokovic struck 10. Federer hit 94 clean winners to 54 – a staggering 40-shot advantage. In overall points he outscored his opponent 218 to 204. These are insane anomalies – because they do not take into account Djokovic’s uncanny ability to extricate himself from one tight spot after another – and there were a whole lot of them.As Djokovic saw it: “I had to have a good defence because, for most of the match, I was on the back foot. I wasn’t serving the best. Roger was dictating play from the back of the court. So I fought a lot.“I spent a lot of time during the match quite far behind the baseline. But I am accustomed to that, I’m used to it. I like sliding on that surface. I think it has something to do with my childhood, skiing a lot. I guess the amount of skiing and sliding on the snow has adapted my ankles to that type of motion. Ever since that time, my professional career as a young player, I have trained on sliding on courts. I do enjoy it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa15908f6e84e6321efb28efeb1237106c752ea2/253_357_3996_2398/master/3996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ebb792f1ebc556f9747121958128ff2","title":"tao of glass review royal exchange manchester philip glass phelim mcdermott","story":"Royal Exchange theatre, ManchesterPhelim McDermott’s sublime collage of theatrical fragments is the fantastical, tearjerking fruition of a lifelong dreamIn his youth, the actor and director Phelim McDermott would play the album Glassworks over and over again. “Philip Glass – on repeat!” says the now 55-year-old in his visionary new show Tao of Glass, sounding a little contrite that he might have driven his family mad.Still, the obsession turned out to be lifelong. Tao of Glass, co-directed with Kirsty Housley and with a score by Glass himself, is – on one level – the story of McDermott’s long-held dream of creating a piece to his music. Aided by three puppeteers and a small band of musicians, he acts out his story not as a narrative, but as a collage of fragments. His initial idea, he tells us, had been to stage Maurice Sendak’s children’s book In the Night Kitchen, about a boy falling into a surreal underworld. But Sendak died before work could begin, and the project came to nothing. Yet what do we have here? A falling puppet boy, a model piano that ingeniously transforms into a toy theatre of kitchen cupboards and utensils, a fantasy flight inside a milk bottle, all to a specially composed score.It’s just one scene of many that deftly layer story, sensation, make-believe and enigma. Some are funny, some matter-of-fact, some philosophical, and some simply magical: puppets fleetingly formed by tissue paper, a snow of sheet music, McDermott lying comatose beside an unplayed piano as the stage rotates like a turning world.In one key section, McDermott explains Arny Mindell’s theory of three levels of existence – consensus reality, dreamland, essence – and the piece as a whole, meandering in subject from coffee tables to Lao Tzu to comas, seems to traverse these very layers, while three concentric rings that circle the stage rise and fall above it. In another, he muses on the Japanese art of kintsugi: the mending of broken pottery with seams of gold, to make what is broken more beautiful.Again, you sense this as both a particular story and a guiding idea. Tao of Glass is itself the beautiful joining of fragmented scenes.The gold that joins them is music. It’s not only that Glass’s music is the seam running through the scenes, but also that the staging itself is a kind of Glassian music: a fluctuating field of motifs, echoes, transfigurations and returns, layers of mood, texture and tone, gentle intimations of the ineffable and the sublime.

Yeah, I’ll let you through.’”The film, Filth \u0026amp Wisdom, wasn’t too well received, alas. But being handpicked by Madonna for her directorial debut – McClure must have felt she was about to make it? “When you’re young,” says the actor, her blue eyes widening, “it’s hard because your expectations are so high. Just having so much rejection, I’d built quite a thick skin. Even so I was like, ‘This is it, I know it.’ And it wasn’t, again.”It’s safe to say McClure has made it now. We are sitting in a fancy London hotel and, last night, she was at a screening of her latest drama, though she insists: “I don’t want to feel that relaxed about things. I live in the real world and I don’t take things for granted.” As the newly promoted DI Kate Fleming in the BBC’s Line of Duty juggernaut, McClure reached a prime-time audience, and her recent documentary, Our Dementia Choir, was one of the most affecting TV shows of the year. Now she’s about to star in a standalone film, one of three dramas in an anthology for Channel 4, created with writer and director Dominic Savage.Her film, I Am Nicola, is about a disintegrating relationship set against a background of coercive control. When Savage asked what kind of story she’d like to do, McClure said a drama about a relationship. “I’m fascinated by them,” she says. “It’s such a massive part of who you are, and it’s destructive – and it’s amazing. I had ideas about what I wanted that to feel and look like. I love watching people doing really boring, normal stuff. Dominic’s brave enough to do that, to capture it.”Nicola is a hairdresser while her boyfriend (Perry Fitzpatrick) has an office job, and their relationship begins to feel suffocating. Some of I Am Nicola is based on McClure’s own experiences: “Jealousy and trust issues. It can be quite isolating and you don’t really know you’re in it when you’re in it.” These previous relationships weren’t abusive, though, as Nicola’s is. “It was just being young – two people not really knowing how to have an adult relationship.”Savage worked out the scenes, but the dialogue was improvised. “You’ll see a scene that could last two minutes but we’ve spent 20 minutes beforehand and after developing it, so it feels like you’ve got a lot of raw emotion. It’s interesting. I like working that way.” McClure has known Fitzpatrick since she was 11, when they both attended Nottingham’s drama group, the Television Workshop, where improvisation was a key part.McClure grew up in the city, where her dad was a joiner and her mum a hairdresser. She wanted to be a dancer, but when she got a place at drama school acting took over her life. “I felt such freedom, made a great bunch of friends, created drama and plays. My head just spun.”When she was 14, she got a place at London’s Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, but her parents couldn’t afford to send her. (Years later, she found letters they had written to the council and arts organisations pleading for donations.) “I didn’t really know what I was missing so it was fine. Looking back, you kind of go, ‘It wasn’t meant to be.’” And anyway, the workshop was brilliant. “It was a bit of a shithole, really,” she says, laughing. “That’s what I loved about it. There was this little dungeon of props and costumes – and they were minging. There were battered old settees we’d pull into scenes. There was stuff everywhere.”It wasn’t precious: everything could be ripped up or painted. She loved being able to swear in character, a novelty for a kid. “You couldn’t be told off. There was no judgment. It was free, so you had everybody from all walks of life, all ethnicities, all classes. It was the most incredible place because you were judged purely on your talent.”McClure did live in London for a while. “I always said I can’t stay here because …” She pauses, then becomes deadly serious. “I begrudge paying that much for a pint. It really does piss me off. My life is not predominantly my work. Jonny and my family and friends are my priority. I have a great opportunity to dip my toe into London, get loads of stuff done, and then I go home.”McClure’s first proper job was in Shane Meadows’s comedy-drama A Room for Romeo Brass, when she was 15. “I genuinely thought it was big-time,” she says, smiling again. “It was shown in Nottingham and all my mates went to see it. I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m in a film! My life’s going to change overnight!’ Later I was told it was shown at six cinemas across the country. But in my head, it was everywhere – it was in America, they were going to discover me, Julia Roberts was going to want to cast me in her next film. I was young, really naive.”Meadows cast her again in his film This Is England, and she reprised her role as skinhead Lol for the TV spin-offs, one of which won her a Bafta. She had been working since she was 16 in shops and offices, throughout these early roles. “I do remember saying to them, ‘If it all goes wrong, can I come back?’” McClure, now 36, has been vocal about the lack of acting opportunities for those from lower-income families. “I think people think I’m against people who are privileged, and I’m not. I’m privileged now, to be able to pay my bills and do the work I do.” But “from what I hear, they are cutting drama and arts in schools and train fares aren’t getting cheaper”. It’s hard to afford last-minute trips to London when an audition comes up, she explains, “and people are struggling to join drama schools because of their financial situation”.McClure has set up a production company “to focus on working-class drama and comedy. I’m interested in stories I can relate to. It’s not always dark, it doesn’t always have to be a complete tragedy. And trying to get directors who are from a similar world – because it’s all right saying we’ve got this brilliant script, but all of a sudden you’ve got somebody directing it who’s not from that world. That can be tricky.”Although she has never experienced the sort of #MeToo harassment other women have spoken out about, she has experienced sexism. Or as she puts it: “I have experienced some right twats, as in men who treat men differently to how they treat me.” Things such as a male actor being asked if he is happy to start a scene “and I’m stood in the room at the same time. I’m like, ‘Yeah and I’m also happy to go.’ It’s little things like that, which you might think are nothing, but you’re offending me by not asking me. I am quite strong and to some people I might seem a little cocky, but if I’ve got an opinion I like it to be heard. That’s not me trying to be difficult. I’ve seen too many men walk into the room and go, ‘What’s happening?’ And then you do it as a woman and you feel like you’re being difficult.”She’d like to have a go at directing, and has one project “bubbling away”. In the meantime, is she having to plan her life around Line of Duty? “There’s nothing to plan around so I’m kind of ignoring it.” The sixth series has been commissioned but she doesn’t know any more than that. “No one’s got anything to tell us. Nothing’s been written.”When it started, they had no idea what a hit it would become. “Not in a million years. There’s nobody at the top telling you, ‘We’re going to make sure this is a success.’ It’s the audience who decides that, and that’s what I love about it.” She puts its success down to Jed Mercurio’s writing, but also to casting decisions – a mix of big names such as Thandie Newton, with surprising roles for, say, Neil Morrissey, more often seen in comedy. Even McClure and Compston were relatively unknown indie actors when the series began. “Totally,” she says. “I was a Shane Meadows kid, he was a Ken Loach kid. We’re these indie actors you wouldn’t think you’d trust with a BBC cop show.”McClure seems to approach her career with a simple combination of gratitude and hard work. “I have been lucky. I’ve lost jobs I’ve desperately wanted. I’ve gained jobs that became what I never expected them to become.” Trying to make it big in the US has never been a priority – she has never even been to Los Angeles, she says, then laughs at my disbelieving expression.“That’s the reaction I get,” she says. “What am I going to do? Go and knock on doors? I’ve done that since I was 11. It’s not that I don’t want to try it and do other things but I don’t know if, at 36, I’ve got the patience to sell myself again.” She smiles brightly. “I love British TV, I love British film. I like where I live and the work I get.”• I Am Nicola is on Channel 4 on 23 July at 10pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0bd1ee209cf6cbc3a4669c849b0b02b767a20/0_11_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f5c82086065fccbde3fd5d4433d97","title":"why are we like this the psychology of procrastination","story":"From deleting social media apps to setting limits on your screen time – here’s how to deal with the existential malaise of putting off the important thingsYou know that thing you’ve been putting off doing? Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible.

About 700 people have recovered from infections.The latest official statistics list a total of 2,489 cases, of which 2,395 are confirmed. Twelve new cases were confirmed over the weekend and there were 10 deaths.The confirmed case announced late on Sunday in eastern Congo involves a pastor who became ill on Tuesday and sought treatment at a registered health centre. It is thought he was receiving care from a nurse at his accommodation in Butembo but decided to leave the city, and arrived at a health centre in Goma, North Kivu province, on Sunday showing symptoms of Ebola.The 46-year-old did not show signs of illness at three medical checkpoints on the 18-hour journey, though he gave different names, indicating a desire to hide his identity, officials said. He has now been sent back to Butembo for further care.While in Butembo, the pastor held regular services in seven churches, during which he laid his hands on worshippers, including people who were ill, the health ministry said.Officials called on local communities to take precautions such as washing their hands and avoiding physical contact with anyone suspected of contamination with the virus.The number of people moving around or through the zone worst hit by Ebola has been a big challenge for health services. Another problem has been attacks against health workers and treatment facilities. On Monday the health ministry said two Ebola awareness workers had been killed in the affected zone.Eastern DRC is home to a myriad of armed groups, and Mai Mai militia fighters are active near the hardest-hit towns. Health teams have been unable to access areas affected by violence to vaccinate people at risk of infection and to bring infected patients into isolation.At other times the violence against health teams has come from residents who do not want their loved ones taken to treatment centres or buried in accordance with guidelines aimed at reducing Ebola transmission.Health experts have long feared that the disease could make its way to Goma, which is located on the Rwandan border and is traversed by large numbers of travellers from across a vast area.The health ministries in DRC’s neighbours have been preparing for months for the possibility of cases, and frontline health workers have been vaccinated.While the experimental vaccine is believed to have saved countless lives, not all Congolese people have accepted it. Some falsely believe that the vaccine is what is making people sick, in part because people can still develop the disease after getting the shot if they already had been infected.Peter Piot, who co-discoverer of the Ebola virus and has been a leading authority on the outbreaks since, called for “improved coordination, high-level political support, and urgent unified action” in the handling of the DRC epidemic.Speaking before a high-level United Nations and World Health Organization meeting in Geneva, he said: “There is no evidence that the end of this devastating epidemic is in sight. Rather, there is a real risk that this epidemic could further expand.”Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it much regretted the decision of the Congolese health minister to rule out the the WHO-recommended use of a second vaccine in North Kivu.“It is hard to understand why such a decision was taken, going so far as to ban any research on investigational Ebola vaccines in the country during this outbreak,” he said. “DRC has been a leader in innovation during Ebola outbreaks, and should remain at the forefront of research and innovation in this area.”LSHTM has been supporting the efforts in DRC to control the virus.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c8c45107feffe1a458436ec8aa36436c13e4f49/0_433_4464_2679/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f811fdc9640b739ccbe6adc836b4fbce","title":"jacob zuma south africa corruption inquiry","story":"Former president faces allegations he presided over vast corruption networkSouth Africa’s former president Jacob Zuma has told a judicial inquiry into corruption allegations that he is the victim of a plot by foreign intelligence agencies to seek his downfall.Speaking on the first day of five days of testimony, Zuma denied he had presided over an immense system of corruption and patronage that drained billions from the country’s exchequer.Zuma was ousted last year after almost a decade in power, following a bitter internal battle within the ruling African National Congress party. He faces hours of questioning by Raymond Zondo, a senior judge, mandated to investigate allegations of “state capture” in South Africa during his presidency.In hearings on Monday morning, Zuma claimed two foreign intelligence agencies had recruited spies within the ANC as part of a scheme to control South Africa and that the inquiry was designed to smear him.The inquiry was set up after an ombudsman’s report uncovered apparent evidence of improper contact between three wealthy businessmen brothers – Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta – and senior officials in Zuma’s administration.The report, which stopped short of asserting criminal behaviour, called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies had acted improperly.Among the cases it reviewed was an allegation by the then deputy finance minister that the Guptas had offered to secure him his boss’s job, as well as claims that Zuma had directed state firms to award tenders to companies owned by the family.Zuma has said the three Gupta brothers are his friends but he denies any influence-peddling in their relationship.The Gupta family denied the accusations and left South Africa around the time that Zuma was ousted.The inquiry has also heard a series of further serious allegations from witnesses in recent months, describing massive bribes paid to officials by businesses seeking favours.Throughout the day, the 77-year-old Zuma and his lawyers continued to portray the him as a victim. “I have been provoked and provoked to the last degree … My own family suffers … people forget that I have a family who do not want to hear lies about me,” he said.Zuma said he could trace the conspiracy against him to the early 1990s, when he received an intelligence report that two foreign intelligence agencies “from big countries” and a branch of the apartheid government had come up with a strategy to get rid of him.“They took a decision that Zuma must be removed from the decision-making structures of the ANC. That’s why the character assassination, that is the beginning of the process that has put me where I am today,” Zuma saidAfter the hearing, he addressed hundreds of supporters who had gathered outside the offices of the inquiry in Johannesburg.Some wore military fatigues emblazoned with the emblem of the former armed wing of the ANC shouted: “Hands off Zuma!”Natasha Mazzone, a senior parliamentarian with the opposition Democratic Alliance party, said Zuma was trying to whitewash serious allegations: “The fact that we’ve heard a conspiracy theory dating back to 1990 is proof that the real truth is going to take a long time to extract.”There have been fears that Zuma will use the hearings as a platform to attack his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, who led the ANC to a convincing election victory in May but has so far been unable to fully assert his authority over the party.Observers say Ramaphosa needs to move quickly to root out entrenched networks of patronage and graft, often involving iniduals who owe senior positions within the party or public administration to Zuma.Zuma faces a separate corruption investigation involving 16 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa’s armed forces in 1994. He denies the charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb680950c52934fb5244392f428df40121de5773/0_74_5192_3116/master/5192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b99a21080ec951dcc3849a443f15c15d","title":"world hunger un report","story":"Eliminating hunger by 2030 is an immense challenge, say heads of UN agenciesMore than 820 million people worldwide are still going hungry, according to a UN report that says reaching the target of zero hunger by 2030 is “an immense challenge”.The number of people with not enough to eat has risen for the third year in a row as the population increases, after a decade when real progress was made. The underlying trend is stabilisation, when global agencies had hoped it would fall.Millions of children are not getting the nutrition they need. The UN says the pace of progress in halving child stunting and reducing the number of low birthweight babies is too slow, which jeopardises the chances of achieving another of the sustainable development goals.The report is from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the UN Children’s Fund (Unicef), the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization.While hunger remains widespread, obesity – also related to malnutrition – continues to rise in all regions. There are 338 million school-age children and adolescents who are overweight and 672 million obese adults. Asia and Africa, which have nine out of 10 of all stunted children and more than nine out of 10 of all wasted children worldwide, are also home to nearly three-quarters of all overweight children worldwide, largely driven by unhealthy diets.One in seven babies around the world were born with low birthweight in 2015, the report says, many of them to adolescent mothers. That puts them at risk of poor development.The world’s population has steadily grown, with most people living in urban areas. Technology has “evolved at a dizzying pace, while the economy has become increasingly interconnected and globalised”, say the heads of the UN agencies in a foreword to the report.“Many countries, however, have not witnessed sustained growth as part of this new economy. The world economy as a whole is not growing as much as expected.”Climate breakdown is affecting agriculture and the number of farmers has declined. “All of this has led to major shifts in the way in which food is produced, distributed and consumed worldwide – and to new food security, nutrition and health challenges.”Hunger is increasing in countries where economic growth is lagging and there is income inequality.“Our actions to tackle these troubling trends will have to be bolder,” the UN leaders say. “We must foster pro-poor and inclusive structural transformation focusing on people and placing communities at the centre to reduce economic vulnerabilities and set ourselves on track to ending hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df646010cfc14917caef6f396802592ca88bd00/0_356_5439_3263/master/5439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=794e283186eeb5276413a99d6ba0e887","title":"i want my countrys image to be good has romanias ruling party moved on","story":"After huge public protests, Viorica Dăncilă must prove she is not just a proxy for the former PSD leader who was jailed for corruptionIn less than 48 hours in May, Romania’s ruling party was given a triple dose of reality when it was badly beaten in European parliamentary elections, rebuked in a referendum on its attempt to reverse tough anti-corruption laws and had its powerful party leader, Liviu Dragnea, jailed for three-and-a-half years for abuse of office.It was a stinging reproach for the Social Democratic party (PSD), after two and a half years of what many considered government-led attacks on the rule of law that caused the largest protests in the country since the fall of communism and led to the president, Klaus Iohannis, calling the public vote on what critics said were ruling party efforts to make it more difficult to combat rampant state corruption.Sitting in a plush meeting room in the main government building in Bucharest, Viorica Dăncilă, the Romanian prime minister, is blunt about the beating her party took. “I consider these elections not as a victory of the opposition parties but as a defeat for the PSD,” she said. However, she believes her party can turn things around.In the aftermath of the May votes, Dăncilă vowed to abandon the controversial judicial proposals, a pledge she reiterated this week. “We have understood the message from 26 May. We have not spoken about the justice system, we have not let anybody get involved on that topic … I would like to go back to the agenda that is focused on the citizen, less on the justice system,” she said.The 55-year-old former MEP has fronted the government for the last 18 months, which included the six months from January 2019 when Romania held the rotating EU presidency, and moving on won’t be easy.As with Brexit in Britain, the fight against corruption and changes to the judiciary in Romania have dominated political discourse in recent years. The country ranks among the EU’s most corrupt states, according to Transparency International, with Brussels having kept its judicial system, along with that of neighbouring Bulgaria, under special monitoring since the countries joined the bloc in 2007.Another source of tension between Bucharest and Brussels is the negotiations over the head of the new European public prosecutor’s office. Laura Codruţa Kövesi, the former head of Romania’s anti-corruption agency, is strongly opposed by her own government but favoured by the European parliament.Kövesi, who made a name for herself as an anti-corruption crusader going after top politicians, was fired last year in a move that many believe was politically motivated. After being shortlisted for the new pan-European role this year, criminal proceedings were launched against Kövesi back home and she was temporarily banned from leaving the country or talking to the press.Dăncilă would not be drawn on whether her government would continue to oppose Kövesi’s appointment, but said that she personally believed Kövesi must “solve her issues with the justice system” before taking this kind of role. “What do we do if those accusations are real? I don’t know if they are real or not, it’s a hypothesis, but I believe that the Romanian image will be affected and I want my country’s image to be very good,” she added.Dăncilă must deal with her own image problems, having been plagued throughout her time in office by accusations that she was appointed simply to serve as a proxy for Dragnea, who was unable to become prime minister due to a previous conviction for electoral fraud. She was installed as his successor as the leader of the PSD last month.“We cannot debate her performance as a prime minister,” said Dan Barna, the leader of the opposition Save Romania Union party. “Nobody in Romania really believes she is the credible prime minister and the one who’s deciding the direction of the party.”Dăncilă pushed back against this perception. “These accusations came mostly from the opposition,” she said, adding: “The prime minister runs the government … Mr Dragnea wasn’t coming here to the government, or providing indications to the government.”Andrei Ţăranu, the deputy dean of the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration in Bucharest, believes that Dăncilă and her government will struggle to turn around public perception in the short term. “The people still don’t like her they still have some doubts about her proficiency,” he said.Dăncilă, for her part, points to strong economic growth and says her government is focusing on areas such as education, health and infrastructure.Improving relations with Brussels will be another priority, though Dăncilă believes there are double standards at work within the EU that need to be addressed.For most Romanians, however, these are of little concern when compared to the last few years of political and judicial uncertainty. After the damaging results in May, this is a message that Dăncilă suggests she has understood. “We don’t want to repeat the mistakes of the past,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba792dbe2ccfe0bf2752d187de5e82f396a67fe/0_210_5630_3381/master/5630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d99d797d527c26b9f5720180666380e","title":"thousands of tokyo commuters told to work from home to avoid olympic crush","story":"Employees will stay home for two weeks as part of mass trial to take pressure off crowded public transport systemHundreds of thousands of employees in Tokyo will work from home for two weeks as part of a trial of measures designed to reduce congestion during next year’s Olympics.

Twenty million train rides are taken daily in the metropolis. Train operators are planning to extend operating hours for the duration of the Olympics. Most lines usually shut down soon after midnight.Another major concern for the Olympics is blistering heat and stifling humidity, exacerbated after a heatwave killed dozens in Japan last summer.

The proposed project would see 330 million litres of water extracted daily from the Shannon south of Lough Derg.The CRU is evaluating if the utility “appropriately examined all relevant options”, including the potential contribution from groundwater sources, and gave “due and appropriate consideration to key issues raised” under a consultation process.In addition, it is examining the assessment of available water supply, estimates of future domestic and non-domestic demand and allowance “in relation to headroom and peaking factors” to ensure a reliable supply for the region.Specifically, it has been asked to examine Irish Water’s leakage reduction targets and the extent to which – combined with other conservation measures - they could reasonably address protected water needs for the area within the timeframes required.Consultant Emma Kennedy has challenged justification “for a huge cross-country pipeline to pump yet more water into Dublin’s pipes without addressing the root of the problem”.Planning permission for the project cannot proceed until the Government introduces new legislation to allow for major water extraction.With a likelihood of costs escalating, it is unclear if a “guaranteed maximum price” will be applied to the project."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3957350.1563209451!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shannon pipeline not needed if dublin water leaks fixed study claims","story":"Irish Water plans to build a 170-kilometre pipeline from the River Shannon in Tipperary to Dublin to combat water shortages in the capital, but campaigning lawyer and investment analyst Emma Kennedy says their case is full of holes.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe latest cost estimate for a pipeline to carry water from the Shannon to Dublin is between €1.2 billion and €1.3 billion.

Over half of its treated water is lost between the reservoir and the tap,” she told The .“If Irish Water did nothing more than meet its own leakage targets in the coming years, the volume of ‘new’ water available at the tap would more than offset the growth in demand from Dublin’s growing population.”While the capital’s water issues are acute, they are, in her view, down to infrastructure rather than a lack of water.Kielder schemeThe project, she believed, had striking similarities with the infamous Kielder supply scheme in northeast England in 1981, which was considered “a bold and imaginative one: the largest single water conservation scheme yet undertaken” in the country.But the industry it was planned to supply was already reducing its water requirements before construction started. It may have been one of the biggest water projects ever undertaken in Europe, but the reservoir now rests mostly idle. The water is rarely needed.Ultimately, it was condemned as an expensive white elephant. It became, Ms Kennedy said, a victim of “the politics of promotion of mega-projects” and showed “unfortunately, engineering accomplishments were often marred by economic miscalculation”.She argues that fixing Dublin’s leaks essentially creates a huge new “source” of water, which would make the Shannon project redundant,This is a view, however, that is disputed by some experts, who warn Dublin will have major capacity issues in coming years compounded by population growth and climate disruption.Irish Water, Ms Kennedy noted in her report to the committee, is nowhere near meeting its own 2021 leakage target. Indeed, “unaccounted-for water” has gone up, not down.In April 2018, Irish Water said it was currently replacing about 25km of Dublin’s 9,000km of pipes a year. “This equates to an annual replacement rate of 0.3 per cent well below Irish Water’s proclaimed 1 per cent target. London’s water supplier recently replaced 2,074km of pipes in just five years.”Irish Water cites the disruption of replacing pipes, but in London, Thames Water found replacing the pipes reduced disruption by eliminating the need to repeatedly dig up the same stretch of tarmac to deal with repeat bursts.The Irish utility’s policy when a pipe bursts is to patch it up. It told the joint committee that it only actually replaces pipes once there are “multiple frequent failures” and the pipes are bursting “three or four times” a month.‘Third-world pipes’However, Ms Kennedy said the policy of pumping yet more water into the supply system while neglecting the pipes is a time bomb. “This is no longer just about leakage – there can be more efficient ways of reducing leakage than replacing the pipes – this is about a water supply system that has been neglected so badly for so long that it is now barely fit for purpose. It is about a thriving first-world city having to rely on third-world water pipes,” she said.“Dublin has all the makings of a city in a powerful global position, in a world where water is an increasingly valued commodity. It has twice as much water as its householders and industry actually use. Its raw water reservoirs are large by international standards. But it has one major Achilles heel: its water pipes.”Ms Kennedy has advised a number of groups opposed to the pipeline. She has always acknowledged the proposed route passes through a farm owned by her husband’s family near Nenagh.She has furnished a detailed appendix to her latest analysis, which fact checks Irish Water’s statements made to the committee and compares them to the utility’s own reports and those of independent analysts.Unless Dublin addresses its pipes – no matter how much extra water it pumps into one end of the supply system – there will be outages with every cold snap and prolonged drought, and misery for Dublin’s residents, she predicted.“Irish Water claims that it is doing all it can to address the pipes but today we show, again, that Irish Water’s statements about leakage and about the Shannon pipeline are unreliable.”In a letter to committee members, Ms Kennedy said its purpose is “to ensure you are aware Irish Water made statements to the joint committee that its own reports show to be inaccurate or misleading”.While insisting her analysis did not amount to a suggestion of bad faith, she said there were issues about the project, on top of its immense cost, that remained unaddressed.Tomorrow: Contrasting views on the Shannon pipeline project.

pictured here with his wife Princess SophieThe descendants of the last German Kaiser are locked in a legal battle to reclaim thousands of valuable artworks and historical artefacts from the German state, it has emerged.The House of Hohenzollern, the heirs to the former Kings of Prussia and Kaisers of the German Empire, also reportedly want to to return to live in one of their former palaces.The claims have been denounced in the German press as “sheer greed” and an “impertinence to an enlightened society”, and leading German museums have warned that they could strip them of valuable treasures and could even force some to close.But representatives of the former royal family on Monday dismissed those warnings as “utter nonsense” and said the family had no intention of removing artworks from museums.The German culture ministry confirmed at the weekend that negotiations have been underway with representatives of the Hohenzollern family for “several years”. The dispute could end up in court if the two sides are unable to reach agreement.The heirs of the former royal family want to return to live in Cecilienhof Palace, the setting for the 1945 Postdam Conference where Churchill, Stalin and Truman ided postwar EuropeThe claims are understood to be led by Georg Friedrich Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia, the great-great-grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II — the Kaiser Bill who led Germany into the First World War. They include demands for the return of artworks by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Adolph von Menzel and Friedrich Tischbein, and the New Cabinet, one of the most intricate pieces of furniture produced by the 18th century master craftsman David Roentgen.The family has yet to comment on reports it is also demanding the right to live rent-free in the former royal residence of Cecilienhof Palace.The palace was the site of the 1945 Potsdam Conference where Churchill, Stalin and Truman ided up Europe after the Second World War.Today it is a museum, the reception rooms are preserved as they were for the conference, including the table where the leaders met and Churchill\u0027s private office in the next room.The family is seeking the return of works including the 18th century \u0026#34Neuwieder Kabinett\u0026#34“The House of Hohenzollern has repeatedly stated in talks that it takes account of its historical responsibility and mission,” a lawyer for the family told the .“Contrary to various reports, the House’s primary objective is to maintain the collections in existing museums and continue to make them available to the public...Speculation that museums would be forced to close can therefore be dismissed as utter nonsense.”The House of Hohenzollern fell after Germany’s defeat in the First World War. Wilhelm II abdicated and went into exile for the rest of his life, and the family was forced to give up its main palaces.But it retained ownership of many lesser residences and artworks which it later lost after the Second World War - it is these the family is now trying to reclaim.Most of the family’s possessions were in the Russian zone of occupation which later became East Germany, and were expropriated by the communist authorities.The family is pursuing a claim under German laws which mandate the restitution of property seized under communist rule.But opponents say the former royals are not eligible under the law because of a clause that excludes those who were closely involved with the Nazi regime.The table where Churchill, Attlee, Stalin and Truman ided Europe at the 1945 Postdam Conference is still preserved at the Cecilienhof PalaceThe former Kaiser’s son, Crown Prince Wilhelm, allied himself to Hitler for a time in the 1930s in a bid to restore the family’s fortunes.Ongoing talks are “aimed at finding a lasting solution for different art and collection objects, which are valued differently by the public institutions on the one hand and the Hohenzollern House on the other hand,” the German culture ministry said in a statement at the weekend.“At the moment, the positions of the negotiating parties are still very far apart.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Started in 1993, the epic work has grown to include tableaux ranging from prehistoric monsters to Roman residents, with depictions of the Black Death and a royal kidnapping.The tapestry was unveiled last week at Royston Museum and has so far been viewed by more than 1,000 visitors.“It’s incredible, it’s a wonderful example of how important local history is on a national scale. It tells stories every local town across England can relate to,” said Madeline Odent, the museum’s curator.“We had someone walk in at the weekend and they just stopped dead. There have been people who have been in Royston for years who are thrilled to see what they have heard about for so long.“They are just amazed at the quality of the work and the time and effort that has gone into it.”The Royston Tapestry begins with an imagined vision of the area under a primeval ocean 140 million years ago. The story then moves to the Bronze Age and the construction of burial mounds that still overlook the town from the surrounding hills.It continues with the construction of Ermine Street, the Roman road from London to the North, before reaching the Middle Ages with an image of Halley’s Comet at the Norman Conquest – a nod to its more famous forebear’s depiction of the Battle of Hastings. Later scenes show the Black Death, the visit of Cardinal Wolsey, the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and a tableau showing the kidnapping of King James I’s dog by townspeople – who took umbrage with the cost of hosting his court. The dog was returned unharmed with a petition reminding him how much Royston paid when his hunting lodge was in full swing.The tapestry finishes in 1742 with the discovery of the mysterious Royston Cave, a chamber hollowed out of the chalk, its walls covered in carvings long linked to the Knights Templar.Although the project was completed in 2018, the original plans earmarked the tapestry to end in 1991, thereby fuelling speculation it could be added to.“If my successor wants to pick it up and take it to the next few hundred years they are more than welcome to,” Mrs Odent added.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

In order to fix the problem the non-Welsh speakers were told they had to navigate a five-step menu in Welsh.But when the Daily  showed the menu options to a native Welsh speaker he described them as “gibberish”. For example, at one stage users are given the option “Clirio Gosodiadau Wedi anfon yr” which the Welsh speaker said directly translates as “clear the installations has been sent”.Bulb, which has 1.3 million customers, said the problem only affected one in 200 of its smart meters and was the result of a software issue with the in-home displays.Smart meters | Help the  investigateBulb customer James Tombs who lives in Sussex, more than 100 miles from the Welsh border, told Moneysavingexpert: I don\u0027t live in Wales and don\u0027t know Welsh. One day I saw my meter was in Welsh but ignored it as I was busy. I then came back to it later and realised that the screen was locked, the buttons didn\u0027t do anything and the unit wasn\u0027t updating. The clock was stuck at 15.47.I turned it off with the power button on the back and back on and it loaded up again, in Welsh, but it was operational.”He added: “I went on to the Bulb forums, found others with the same problem and followed the directions to change language. It has been fine since.But not all afflicted customers were so lucky. One told Moneysavingexpert he had made a formal complaint to Bulb after its proposed fix only temporarily rectified the problem.Bulb would not reveal how many smart meters it has but said that the wider roll-out of the devices is a big technical challenge.A spokesman said: In some rare cases, in-home displays switch to Welsh. While we think Welsh is a great language, we understand that in many cases people will want their display to be in English.“Luckily the solution is just a few button presses away, and language settings can be changed in less than 10 seconds.Everything you need to know about smart energy metersThe £11bn smart meter roll-out aims to reduce energy usage by providing every household with a display which shows energy usage in real-time in pounds and pence, while the meter itself sends readings to suppliers automatically.Many of the early devices “go dumb” and lose their smart functions if a customer switches supplier which has created frustration for millions.A fix for this problem which will see the first-generation devices connected to a national network is currently in progress but is understood to have been delayed for many households.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Despite his enormous achievements, he faced persecution during his life because he was gay. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts after it was revealed\u0026nbsphe was in a same-sex relationship.Faced with the prospect of imprisonment, he accepted the alternative of “chemical castration” – hormone treatment supposed to suppress his sexual desire. He died of cyanide poisoning in 1954 at the age of 41. The mathematician’s housekeeper found him in his bed with a half-eaten apple on a table. His death was recorded as suicide but experts have since questioned the evidence presented during the inquest at the time.In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown made an official apology\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspthe “appalling way” Turing was treated, and in 2013 he was granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen. In 2016 the government unveiled an “Alan Turing law” that posthumously pardoned thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under outdated gross indecency laws.Alan Turing: Why was the codebreaker convicted and pardoned?The law effectively acted as an apology to those convicted for consensual same-sex relationships before homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967. It came after decades of campaigning from the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and after the family of the Enigma codebreaker delivered a petition to Downing Street before the 2015 general election.The new note will feature a 1951 photo of Turing, a table and mathematical formulae from one of his most influential scientific papers.\u0026nbspIt will also feature a picture of the British Bombe code-breaking machine built at Bletchley Park, as well as a quote Turing gave\u0026nbspin an interview on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come\u0026nbspand only the shadow of what is going to be.”The full note design, including all the security features, will be unveiled closer to it entering circulation. The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, considered for the new note were Mary\u0026nbspAnning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell,\u0026nbspSrinivasa\u0026nbspRamanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger and Alan Turing.Sarah John, the BoE’s chief cashier, said: “The strength of the shortlist is testament to the UK’s incredible scientific contribution. The breadth of iniduals and achievements reflects the huge range of nominations we received for this note and I\u0026nbspthank the public for all their suggestions of scientists we could celebrate.”RBS £10 note with pioneering female figure to be released in OctoberNew £10 with tactile features hailed as ‘fantastic’ for blind peopleI helped judge the BBC’s Icons vote – so where were all the women?Icons review: Alan Turing crowned greatest figure of 20th centuryThis is why Alan Turing’s work could help improve tests for cancerThe new note will be printed on plastic rather than paper as is the current version.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing moved to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he designed the British Bombe cryptographic machine. Turing’s team played a pivotal role in cracking the German Enigma code, previously seen as unbreakable. They decoded naval and U-boat messages, which revealed information about German positions and helped to shift advantage to the allies during the battle for the Atlantic. Turing was awarded an OBE for his code-breaking work.After the war\u0026nbspTuring worked on designs for pioneering early computers including the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first electronic stored-programme computers, which was built in 1950 at the National Physical Laboratory in London. At Manchester University’s computing laboratory\u0026nbsphe developed programming for the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, the world’s first commercially available electronic computer.While at Manchester\u0026nbsphe explored artificial intelligence, proposing an experiment which became known as the Turing Test. A machine could be considered able to “think”\u0026nbspif a human interrogator was unable to distinguish a machine’s response from that of another human being. He also worked on morphogenetic theory, looking at the mysteries of patterns in nature, for example trying to explain the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. His paper, “The chemical basis of morphogenesis”, has since been recognised as pioneering work.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was listening to music on his phone using Spotify, and watching films on Netflix, but he was struggling to buy textbooks or find them in the library when he needed one. Surely, he thought, it must be possible to access books in the same way I access music, film or data? Easily and cheaply, anywhere, any time. But, he realised, there was no subscription service for books. Thus was born Perlego (Latin for “I read through” or “I scan”), the Spotify of textbooks. Van Malderen even went on to write his thesis on the subject, “Why the Old Textbook Model is Broken”.There is a scandal, verging on a scam, in the realm of textbooks. Since 1982, the price of textbooks has risen at three times the rate of inflation. Some figures depict a tenfold increase. As if students didn’t have enough trouble already with tuition fees. They would be justified in feeling it’s a rip-off, up there with secondary ticketing for gigs and flights to Madrid when there’s a Champions League Cup Final on. Perlego aims to make learning accessible, without perhaps killing off libraries completely. “Students can still go to the library to study,” says its CEO and co-founder Van Malderen.Gauthier Van Malderen, 26, was born in Belgium, lived in Henley-on-Thames as a kid, and was an undergraduate in economics and management at Bocconi University in Milan. His dad is in banking and his parents expected him to go into finance. “They nearly had a heart attack when I mentioned textbooks online.” They’ve swung around since. Van Malderen the younger is really responding to student need. When he was still an undergraduate he noticed that most students were using notepads so he set up a business producing very classy notepads, called\u0026nbspIconic Matter (“made by students for students”) with advertising from big companies at the bottom of the page, selling them in Belgium, Switzerland and Morocco. He made enough money out of that scheme to launch Perlego, together with backing from the founder of Zoopla, Alex Chesterman.There are a couple of open access websites where you can download books for free, such as OpenStax, funded by Bill Gates – but it’s non-profit, and Van Malderen is on the side of writers as much as readers.\u0026nbsp“If you’re going to produce high quality work, then it would be nice to get paid.” Van Malderen is sympathetic towards professors. “They don’t want students to have to pay through the nose. They don’t ‘adopt’\u0026nbsptextbooks anymore” (ie\u0026nbspmaking them required reading). In the context of universities trying to open up access, the question of affordability becomes more crucial than ever.We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutionsThe other possible avenue for impecunious students is, of course, theft, not so much nicking books from the library, more using piracy websites. Sitting at a laptop in his offices in Holborn, Gauthier showed me how he could illicitly download the pdf of a classic textbook, Corporate Finance: Theory and Practice, entirely for free. “No wonder publishers are having a hard time,” says van Malderen. “There is a vicious spiral effect. They lose 28 per cent\u0026nbspto piracy, 30 per cent\u0026nbspto second-hand sales.” In short, at present, publishers, authors, and students all end up feeling ripped off.Apparently 88 per cent\u0026nbspof students don’t see piracy as a crime. Van Malderen thinks legal can be cooler. “We can show them the convenience of having one space – a one-stop shop – where you can get all your books. And no one gets ripped off.” The average spend on textbooks in the UK is £439 (medicine will cost a lot more than English) in the US it’s $1,200. The cost of subscribing to Perlego is £12 a month.Perlego also hosts all those public domain books, like The Odyssey and Das Kapital. “The culture has changed,” Van Malderen says. “It’s like music – you don’t want to own the book anymore.” Perlego is a streaming service. You don’t download, you read the book page by page online, on your phone if you like. It’s a “mobile-first learning experience”, as Van Malderen describes it. You can create your own library, like a playlist. And unlike the books in the university library, you can legitimately scribble in the margins and underline sentences, personalising the text.You can become part of a network of readers, with input from other students, so you can compare notes, and get comments from professors too. It’s a virtual seminar that feels like it could make the real, traditional learning environment redundant. “We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutions,” says Van Malderen. “We’re just aiming to make learning more efficient.” It’s like reading, plus social media, where you can “follow” other readers if you like. There is potential for “lifelong learning” too. 25 per cent\u0026nbspof Perlego subscribers are not students, but professionals (or would-be professionals) seeking to upgrade.How do you plan Wimbledon? It’s all about attention to detail‘If we get one person to give up cow’s milk, we’ve made a difference’Why women don’t need a science degree to be successfulAccording to the aggregate data Perlego has collected, psychology is the biggest growth area in higher education, which is good for psychology professors\u0026nbspand publishers to know. But the main intellectual advantage of the online system is that, whatever subject you’re studying, you can always dabble in something else – you’re not restricted to the books specified in your course. “For example,” says Van Malderen, “I was doing economics, but say I wanted to branch out into political science or philosophy, it’s right here”. It’s a whole online library rather than just a bunch of textbooks.A declaration of interest: I teach at Cambridge. I know from personal experience that one thing that always drives students mad is how to put in references at the end of their essays. I’m not one for making recommendations, but I think the next time a student asks me how to do it (and I know it’s going to go wrong somehow), I might say, “Have you tried Perlego?”.

With Brexit bringing an end to reciprocal medical cover, this mattersClick to followThe IndependentThanks to the Conservative Party some 14m people may find travel to Europe much more difficult if not impossible after October 31.\u0026nbspThose people are those of use with pre existing medical conditions.Even with the reciprocal health coverage we currently enjoy thanks to the UK\u0027s memberhip of the EU, it’s still wise for us to take out travel insurance. A no deal Brexit would make it essential. And that can prove very expensive.\u0026nbspHow can we get a fair deal on our travel insurance?How to buy the right travel insuranceThe Financial Conduct Authority waking up to the issue is therefore timely.\u0026nbspIt is proposing a series of reforms to a market in which it currently is legal to discriminate against those with disabilities in a way that it is not against, say, male drivers. The statistics show that those of us with a Y chromosome pose more risk of an accident, which used to be reflected in our premiums. However, the EU put paid to that and you won’t hear many complaints about its decision from the usual suspects.\u0026nbspIf you have a pre-existing medical condition the same protection does not apply. You’re likely to pay more, and potentially so much more that it makes travel impossible, or get hit with exclusions, which can severely limited the effectiveness of travel insurance policies. \u0026nbspThe watchdog is proposing to address this by mandating that insurers point customers to a directory of alternatives who might be prepared to do better when they load their premiums or demand exclusions.\u0026nbspThere are specialists out there which can offer improved deals and policies for we who have pre existing conditions. They still charge more - I pay more than the rest of my family put together - but they can be an improvement on what mainstream insurers offer. \u0026nbspA good innovation? I have to admit to being in two minds about this.\u0026nbspIt may help people get cover who might otherwise be stuck. A couple of years ago Scope, the disability charity, highlighted the case of Samantha Renke, an a 31-year-old actress and disability campaigner, who was quoted £500 for a two-week trip to Mexico.\u0026nbspShe has osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bones, but had had her spine straightened with rods, which would have significantly reduced the risk of her having to claim as a result of her disability. The insurers she tried appeared unwilling to take this into account.\u0026nbspAt a time when underwriting is becoming increasingly automated, with artificial intelligence playing a progressively greater role, I expect this to happen more and more often.\u0026nbspThe FCA’s plan might have helped address the issues she faced. She would have\u0026nbspbeen referred to the\u0026nbspdirectory. I imagine the same thing would happen to me.\u0026nbspBut I worry that what the watchdog is doing is pushing\u0026nbsp14m Britons into an insurance ghetto, allowing what you might call mainstream insurers to wash their hands of us, rather than making them treat us fairly.\u0026nbspSo the plan is not without thorns. Here’s another: It is suggesting providing information to “help consumers understand the implications of travelling with exclusions, and how factors such as country of travel can impact medical costs and therefore travel insurance premiums”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Yet another one was announced alongside the delay: the group said it had formally taken control of Game Digital. So something like this was always on the cards.\u0026nbspThat was the view of the City and investors duly ran for cover. Sports Direct’s shares lost more than ten per cent within minutes of the stock market opening.\u0026nbspMike Ashley’s Sports Direct weighs up £61m Debenhams dealEvans Cycles to close more stores after sale to Sports DirectBut that’s not the most troubling thing about the company’s announcement.\u0026nbspInvestors not named or in the employ of Mike Ashley haven’t had an update on how their company is doing since December. In the interim, it has been as busy as a sports coach in the days leading up to the start of a new season, butting heads, gobbling up businesses, buying back shares.\u0026nbspSports Direct said the reasons for the delay were that integrating HoF into the sprawling retail empire had created “complexities” at a time when auditors overseeing the preparation of company\u0026nbspresults are facing additional scrutiny from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), particularly Grant Thornton, Sports Direct’s auditor.\u0026nbspIt had a rocket fired at it by the watchdog last week. The FRC said only half the firm’s audits were rated as good or requiring limited improvement during its most recent review. One in four had failed to pass muster over the last five years. This landed the firm on the accountancy naughty step.\u0026nbspThose excuses are ostensibly plausible. The problem came with final part of the explanation for the delay, the reference in the stock exchange announcement to “uncertainty as to the current trading performance” of HoF. \u0026nbspUsually the word “uncertain” is code for “bad”. You never see it used when a company’s business is going like the clappers but it isn’t quite sure whether where the best description for its permanence should fall in a range between “better than expected” and “yowza”.But how bad? There’s a big difference between trading being at, say, the bottom end of the company’s or the market’s expectations and the roof falling in.\u0026nbspAnd what’s going on at the rest of the business?\u0026nbspApparently a number of areas are being looked at which could “materially affect guidance”. But which areas? Nobody outside of Sports Direct knows, so the City was left with no option but to assume the worst.\u0026nbspIt was a busy morning for Sports Direct announcements. Another concerned the share buyback programme it announced in April. The company said it spent just shy of £150,000 buying 56,368 shares on 12 July.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Equivalent to £98.Turing played a pivotal role in the development of early computers with his work cracking\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspEnigma code, and he laid the foundations for artificial intelligence. Despite his enormous achievements, he faced persecution during his life because he was gay. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts after it was revealed\u0026nbsphe was in a same-sex relationship.Faced with the prospect of imprisonment, he accepted the alternative of “chemical castration” – hormone treatment supposed to suppress his sexual desire. He died of cyanide poisoning in 1954 at the age of 41. The mathematician’s housekeeper found him in his bed with a half-eaten apple on a table. His death was recorded as suicide but experts have since questioned the evidence presented during the inquest at the time.In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown made an official apology\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspthe “appalling way” Turing was treated, and in 2013 he was granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen. In 2016 the government unveiled an “Alan Turing law” that posthumously pardoned thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under outdated gross indecency laws.Alan Turing: Why was the codebreaker convicted and pardoned?The law effectively acted as an apology to those convicted for consensual same-sex relationships before homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967. It came after decades of campaigning from the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and after the family of the Enigma codebreaker delivered a petition to Downing Street before the 2015 general election.The new note will feature a 1951 photo of Turing, a table and mathematical formulae from one of his most influential scientific papers.\u0026nbspIt will also feature a picture of the British Bombe code-breaking machine built at Bletchley Park, as well as a quote Turing gave\u0026nbspin an interview on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come\u0026nbspand only the shadow of what is going to be.”The full note design, including all the security features, will be unveiled closer to it entering circulation. The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, considered for the new note were Mary\u0026nbspAnning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell,\u0026nbspSrinivasa\u0026nbspRamanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger and Alan Turing.Sarah John, the BoE’s chief cashier, said: “The strength of the shortlist is testament to the UK’s incredible scientific contribution. The breadth of iniduals and achievements reflects the huge range of nominations we received for this note and I\u0026nbspthank the public for all their suggestions of scientists we could celebrate.”RBS £10 note with pioneering female figure to be released in OctoberNew £10 with tactile features hailed as ‘fantastic’ for blind peopleI helped judge the BBC’s Icons vote – so where were all the women?Icons review: Alan Turing crowned greatest figure of 20th centuryThis is why Alan Turing’s work could help improve tests for cancerThe new note will be printed on plastic rather than paper as is the current version.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing moved to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he designed the British Bombe cryptographic machine. Turing’s team played a pivotal role in cracking the German Enigma code, previously seen as unbreakable. They decoded naval and U-boat messages, which revealed information about German positions and helped to shift advantage to the allies during the battle for the Atlantic. Turing was awarded an OBE for his code-breaking work.After the war\u0026nbspTuring worked on designs for pioneering early computers including the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first electronic stored-programme computers, which was built in 1950 at the National Physical Laboratory in London. At Manchester University’s computing laboratory\u0026nbsphe developed programming for the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, the world’s first commercially available electronic computer.While at Manchester\u0026nbsphe explored artificial intelligence, proposing an experiment which became known as the Turing Test. A machine could be considered able to “think”\u0026nbspif a human interrogator was unable to distinguish a machine’s response from that of another human being. He also worked on morphogenetic theory, looking at the mysteries of patterns in nature, for example trying to explain the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. His paper, “The chemical basis of morphogenesis”, has since been recognised as pioneering work.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesAccording to the Which? High Street survey 201929 8. House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesIt said: “The reasons for the delay are the complexities of the integration into the company of the House of Fraser business, and the current uncertainty as to the future trading performance of this business, together with the increased regulatory scrutiny of auditors and audits.“These factors have led to a need for the company to compile more information than in previous years for the audit of period ended 28 April 2019, and has therefore impacted on preparations for and responses to increased challenges in connection with this audit.“Sports Direct would also note that increased regulatory scrutiny is leading to longer lead times generally for the completion of audits.“Sports Direct believes its accounts and their audit to be at an advanced stage. However, there are a number of key areas to conclude on which could materially affect the guidance given in Sports Direct’s announcement of 13 December 2018.”Mike Ashley makes bid for Patisserie ValerieInvestors and analysts were shocked at the decision, branding House of Fraser a “disaster area”, and said Sports Direct should avoid creating more uncertainty.Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “There may be something in what Sports Direct say about company audits generally taking longer because of increased regulation (Superdry’s results were delayed by the complexity of its onerous store impairment provision), but the company hasn’t updated the City since its interims in December and House of Fraser is clearly a disaster area, so this is a serious situation.”Mr Ashley has been on a serious spending spree across the high street in recent years, buying up Evans Cycles, sofa and Game Digital.But his biggest purchase – House of Fraser – from administrators last year, has proved tough to turn around at a time when the high street is struggling to bring customers into stores.Earlier this year, House of Fraser already revealed an underlying pre-tax loss for the first six months of the year of £31.5m on revenues of £70.1m.Bosses had previously said it could break even in the new financial year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ansel Elgort, Harry Styles and Miles Teller were all reportedly considered for the role.“I knew I couldn’t make this film if the casting wasn’t absolutely right, and we searched thoroughly for an actor with the ability to evoke the singular natural movement and vocal qualities of this peerless star, but also the inner vulnerability of the artist,” Luhrmann told Deadline\u0026nbspin a statement.“Throughout the casting process, it was an honour for me to encounter such a vast array of talent.”Created with Sketch.Best films of 2019 (so far) Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab626 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1926 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity.

That is, despite Michael deciding to stay in the villa for two weeks seemingly pointlessly while Joanna is on the outside. It was brutal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 60Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.160 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.260 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.960 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1060 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1160 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1260 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1460 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1560 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1860 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2060 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2160 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2260 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2460 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2560 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2660 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2760 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2860 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3160 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3260 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3360 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3460 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3660 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3860 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3960 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4060 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4160 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4260 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4460 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4560 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4760 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4860 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4960 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5060 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5160 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5260 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5360 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5660 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5860 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6060 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub160 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.260 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.960 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1060 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1160 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1260 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1460 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1560 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1860 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2060 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2160 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2260 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2460 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2560 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2660 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2760 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2860 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3160 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3260 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3360 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3460 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3660 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3860 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3960 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4060 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4160 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4260 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4460 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4560 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4760 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4860 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4960 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5060 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5160 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5260 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5360 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5660 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5860 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6060 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclubCurtis finally made a choice between Maura and FrancescaHaving deliberated between choosing to be with Maura or Francesca for the past few days, Curtis finally decided to go for Maura and the pair shared a kiss on the balcony. A surprising couple, but they do actually look quite cute together.Anton and Belle got back togetherLove Islanders question Michael\u0027s\u0027 feelings for Joanna Caroline Flack’s best outfits on Love IslandIs Bahamas island with swimming pigs mentioned on Love Island real?While the couple’s fiery argument in the Love Island nightclub appeared to be the end of their relationship for good, Anton and Belle promptly made up and decided to get back together… much to Molly-Mae’s bafflement.New bombshells are set to arrive in the villaAt the end of the episode, it was announced that three new bombshells will be entering the villa to ruffle some feathers. It’ll be two girls and a boy – and one of the girls has her eye on Ovie. She knows.Catch up with all the action as it happened, below...Catch up with last night\u0027s episode hereLove Island girls in shock as Anton caught giving number to someone outside villaLove Island\u0027s Megan Barton-Hanson says she lost weight from stressLove Island airs at 9pm on ITV2The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA giant manta ray has been filmed appearing to beg a professional er for help saving her life.The three-metre-wide sea creature is shown swimming up to snorkelling guide Jake Wilton and flipping over in the water – apparently to show him fish hooks embedded in her right eye.The footage, caught near Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia’s north west coast, seems to show the manta ray then staying perfectly still as Mr Wilton gently removes the potentially deadly spikes.The animal – well known to locals and affectionately nicknamed Freckles – then swims away with a flourish as the er emerges triumphantly with the hooks.Monty Halls, a British marine biologist aboard the boat at the time, said: “That manta absolutely understood what was going on. Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesAccording to the Which? High Street survey 201929 8. House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesIt said: “The reasons for the delay are the complexities of the integration into the company of the House of Fraser business, and the current uncertainty as to the future trading performance of this business, together with the increased regulatory scrutiny of auditors and audits.“These factors have led to a need for the company to compile more information than in previous years for the audit of period ended 28 April 2019, and has therefore impacted on preparations for and responses to increased challenges in connection with this audit.“Sports Direct would also note that increased regulatory scrutiny is leading to longer lead times generally for the completion of audits.“Sports Direct believes its accounts and their audit to be at an advanced stage. However, there are a number of key areas to conclude on which could materially affect the guidance given in Sports Direct’s announcement of 13 December 2018.”Mike Ashley makes bid for Patisserie ValerieInvestors and analysts were shocked at the decision, branding House of Fraser a “disaster area”, and said Sports Direct should avoid creating more uncertainty.Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “There may be something in what Sports Direct say about company audits generally taking longer because of increased regulation (Superdry’s results were delayed by the complexity of its onerous store impairment provision), but the company hasn’t updated the City since its interims in December and House of Fraser is clearly a disaster area, so this is a serious situation.”Mr Ashley has been on a serious spending spree across the high street in recent years, buying up Evans Cycles, sofa and Game Digital.But his biggest purchase – House of Fraser – from administrators last year, has proved tough to turn around at a time when the high street is struggling to bring customers into stores.Earlier this year, House of Fraser already revealed an underlying pre-tax loss for the first six months of the year of £31.5m on revenues of £70.1m.Bosses had previously said it could break even in the new financial year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the past, reconnaissance planes such as the U-2 and\u0026nbspF-117 have been developed and flown from there.It is likely that it does much the same now, though anything giving any details on current operations is entirely secret.US military ‘ready’ to stop alien-hunters raiding Area 51That secretiveness has led to suggestions that Area 51 is actually focused on alien operations, either instead of or in addition to what has been more officially revealed.Those conspiracy theories encompass a wide variety of possible uses: some say the base is storage for crashed UFOs, others suggest it might serve as a home for aliens that have made it to Earth. Others still suggest it is being used for technology that is secret though not necessarily alien, such as time travel or teleportation technology.The base sits in a remote part of Nevada. The nearest large city is Nevada, but it’s not very near – nothing much is, since it is located deep in the desert.Around Area 51 are a series of alien-themed attractions. It’s one of those where the people supposedly participating in the event are told to meet, at the “Alien Center” that’s just one of the tourist attractions accessible from the nearby highway.As you’d expect from a top-secret government facility, nobody really knows what’s going on. And as you’d also expect, trying to find out is a difficult and dangerous endeavour.If you don’t “storm” Area 51, but instead try and walk in, you won’t get very far.The area is rigged up with a variety of motion sensors and CCTV cameras, which immediately trigger a response from very real armed guards. As numerous signs around the base make clear, those guards are allowed to use deadly force to repel people.Flying over the base is impossible, too, since it and the area around it is completely off-limits to civilian and even military aircraft.In short, it stressed that those same deadly measures will be used against anyone trying to enter.“The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.”Most likely not. The event was created satirically, as can be seen in all of the discussion surrounding it, including the event’s description, which makes reference to a manga series.“We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,” it reads.\u0026nbsp”If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets see them aliens.”But there is of course no way of knowing what will actually happen when 20 September comes around. Plenty of things, especially in recent years, have been created as jokes and then come true, and with a million people committing to head to the base it would only take a tiny proportion of those people to form a fairly significant protest.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab626 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1926 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes.

But the German politician was emphatic\u0026nbspshe would not change the deal struck by Theresa May, adding: “The withdrawal agreement negotiated with the United Kingdom is the best and only possible deal for an orderly withdrawal.”The letter was sent by Ms von der Leyen to the leaders of the socialist and liberal groups in the European parliament, whose support she needs to be confirmed as president. They had written to her to ask her to spell out her programme to win their votes. “I want to explain my thinking on Brexit,” Ms von der Leyen concludes the letter, which was obtained by The Independent.No-deal Brexit will leave UK at mercy of France, Hammond warnsNo-deal Brexit set to hit business for £22bn a yearBrexit has sent ‘not as important’ Britain into decline, says Irish PM“This was an issue that was raised by several members from your group. I very much regret that the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union. But I fully respect this decision. Brexit creates uncertainty for citizens’ rights, for economic and territorial actors, and for the stability and peace on the Island of Ireland.“The withdrawal agreement negotiated with the United Kingdom is the best and only possible deal for an orderly withdrawal. If elected I am ready to pave the way to the ambitious and strategic partnership we want to build with the United Kingdom. Should more time be required, and should there be good reasons provided, I will support a further extension if good reasons are provided.”The suggestion that talks under Article 50\u0026nbspcould be extended will give heart to Remain campaigners\u0026nbspwho believe more time would be needed to organise a second referendum.But some EU national leaders think the bloc should cut Britain adrift and not grant an extension, to end the disruptive affair. The period has already been extended twice and was supposed to expire on 29 March 2019. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister,\u0026nbspsaid last month\u0026nbspEU leaders had run out of patience with Britain and would only support an extension for a general election or second referendum.The confirmation from the the nominee that she would not reopen the withdrawal agreement – a longstanding EU position – clashes with the views of many Tories in Westminster who believe\u0026nbspthe EU can be forced to renegotiate. The Sun newspaper reported on Monday that Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay told the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, five times in a recent meeting that the deal is “dead”. It has been rejected by MPs three times.Whether any extension would take place would be decided by\u0026nbspEU leaders, and Ms von der Leyen is set to take office on 1 November\u0026nbspwhen Jean-Claude Juncker’s mandate expires.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentBoris Johnson has said he would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October “do or die”, but leaks from the civil service suggest it has warned that the UK is not prepared for a no-deal exit on that date. The frontrunner for next prime minister has said he would withhold payment of the Brexit financial settlement to try to force the EU back to the table.Ms Von der Leyen spends the rest of the letter explaining her programme for commission president. Highlights include more ambitious climate targets, “a more growth-friendly fiscal stance” in the euro area, beefed-up provisions for the rule of law, and reforms to the EU processes to make them more democratic. She faces a vote in the European parliament on Tuesday, which she needs to pass to confirm her position as European commission president.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us,\u0027 says Mounir BaatourClick to followThe IndependentMounir Baatour’s office is cool, the steady thrum of the air conditioner offering a welcome break from the blistering summer heat that has descended upon Tunis. Past noon, little moves outside. The streets are empty and even the city’s ubiquitous cat population has slinked off to the shadows.Despite the temperature, Baatour, the first openly gay man to run for president in a Muslim country, remains focused upon the task ahead.The road leading to the November poll is unlikely to offer a smooth ride. Homosexuality itself isn’t illegal in Tunisia. However, practising it is. This distinction has allowed Baatour, a lawyer, to register the pressure group\u0026nbspShams. Along with others, the group campaigns for a repeal of the colonial French\u0026nbsplaw\u0026nbspproscribing sodomy.Likewise, legal\u0026nbsprestrictions criminalising\u0026nbsp”outrages against public decency” are often used to persecute the country’s LGBT+ population – these\u0026nbspremain firmly with the sights of Baatour and other rights campaigners. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn top of this, the police force appears eager to exploit existing edicts allowing, for instance,\u0026nbspenforced anal examinations to be used as evidence of sexuality. This is buttressed by a judiciary and political establishment long practised in the art of looking the other way.Created with Sketch.Best photos from Pride 2019 around the world Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In February, a young man from the coastal city of Sfax received an eight month\u0026nbspsentence for engaging in homosexual acts after reporting being raped by two other men. Other stories of official abuse are legion. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I am openly gay,”\u0026nbspBaatour\u0026nbspsays. “I came out 20 years ago. I was jailed for three months for sodomy in 2013. There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us.”Baatour, his association and his relatively fringe Liberal party are children of Tunisia’s revolution. In the years immediately following 2011, a number of gay rights groups emerged, led by Baatour’s own Shams, calling for a repeal of\u0026nbspanti-homosexual laws.However, even here, Shams’ tactics have given rise to ision, with a coalition for LGBT+ rights issuing a statement\u0026nbsplast year distancing themselves from Shams and its president. Baatour attributes this schism to his openness to potentially normalising relations with Israel, a suggestion considered anathema to many on Tunisia’s left.Perhaps ironically, the same period during which many of these groups arose also witnessed an explosion in Islamism across Tunisia, with the moderate Islamist Ennahda party vying with the radical\u0026nbspAnsar al-Sharia\u0026nbspfor the political souls of Tunisia’s religious majority.When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No\u0026nbspAnsar\u0026nbspal-Sharia was outlawed in 2013, and support for Ennahda appears to have ebbed since the groundswell of popular support that saw them achieve a plurality vote in the country’s first free elections in 2011.But across many sections of Tunisian society, values typically bend towards the traditional. In August, conservative demonstrators of both genders took to the street to protest a\u0026nbsppresidentially mandated report\u0026nbspurging greater inidual freedoms and equality across the genders. \u0026nbspAs far as homosexuality is concerned, those conservative sentiments cut deeper. A June 2019 survey by the polling institute Arab Barometer reported that just 7 per cent of Tunisians condoned homosexuality. It’s a sentiment reflected within the rhetoric of some of Baatour’s populist rivals for the presidency. Law professor Kais Saied\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa close second in the polls – he has\u0026nbspsuggested\u0026nbspthat encouraging the spread of homosexuality within the country is a foreign plot. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAlleged rape victim imprisoned for homosexual acts by Tunisian court“I think we need to have a debate about homosexuality in Tunisia,” says Baatour, who identifies as Muslim but doesn’t practise.“I’m not talking about promoting homosexuality, just about decriminalising it. Gay people don’t do anyone any harm. They should be free to do what they want with their bodies. If, as Kais Saied has said, homosexuality is a sickness, then – even if I accept that – I have to ask, why are you putting sick people in jail?“When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No. So they must return to jail for a further three years and then for the rest of their lives.”Though what Baatour is proposing might seem radical, it is not without precedent. In arguing his case, Baatour points to the country’s first post-independence president, Habib Bourguiba, who in 1956 introduced landmark laws outlawing polygamy and introducing a code of women’s rights that stands to this day.LGBT activists arrested at unauthorised pride march in Cuba“All of that at the time was controversial, a lot of people said it was against Islam. However, Bourguiba had the political will to impose it. In 1956, Tunisia was more conservative than it is now, but people came to accept it and still do.” \u0026nbspHowever, while accepting that much of the attention on him focuses upon his stance on LGBT+ rights, Baatour is keen to stress that his candidacy is about more.He wants to address many of Tunisia’s underlying ills, from the state enterprises that continue to haemorrhage money, to the vast scale of the country’s informal economy, to the environment, which remains a priority.But above all, he says, is his commitment to promoting civil liberties and the rights of the inidual.Whether or not he is successful remains to be seen. However, for Baatour, the fight alone is worthwhile. If anything, he says, his campaign forces the other candidates to address the lack of progress on civil liberties and inidual rights within Tunisia.Baatour leans forward, “I will place this at the very heart of my campaign.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity.

It will be the beginning and the end of King BoJo the First.There will be no second chances. The next Chancellor of the Exchequer must be a proven Brexiteer in word and deedBoris has a chance of surviving his  days.The Treasury is the most powerful and implacable enemy of Brexit. “The new Chancellor needs three key qualities,” says a source close to Boris.“They must have a Brexit pedigree, absolute loyalty to Boris and the intellectual self-confidence to take on Whitehall and the Treasury.”Qualities such as these are scarce in the present Cabinet. The final choice is likely to surprise everyone, especially Remainers.Some names mentioned to me would, to say the least, offer a bracing challenge to pro-EU establishment fanatics who spent the past three years sabotaging the  referendum.Unless the new Chancellor takes them head-on, those forces will crush both Boris and Brexit. Observers have identied the tank traps and sniper nests facing the new PM.He is up against a Remain-dominated Parliament aided by slippery Speaker Bercow, an army of civil service mandarins skilled in the machinery of government and covering fire from BBC propagandists.In the face of such overwhelming odds, a pro-Leave PM is surely doomed to fail. Not so. Despite appearances, Boris has a plan.He will fly immediately to Brussels with a genuine bid to reopen Theresa May’s botched withdrawal agreement.He would seek a clear path out of the EU customs union, single market and European Court jurisdiction, plus a sensible solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.The alternative will be for Britain to leave the EU on October  with No Deal. Unless much has changed, Brussels will say: “Non!” Boris will announce he has no option but to call a snap “No Deal” election.Remainers are appalled at the idea, and for good reason. Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying. Remain voters want this sorted, too.Elections are always risky. But a Tory Party still dithering and paralysed on the biggest issue of the age is the greatest risk of all. Right now, the omens are promising. Labour is committing ritual suicide, shedding voters in droves.Millions of Tory defectors would flock back to a party committed to a final, irreversible Brexit taking us past the October  dead-line and sucking support from Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.In the intervening weeks, a Boris regime could recruit voters abandoned by both major parties over crime, low pay, high taxes and housing.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, blue- collar voters on less than £, a year, are “up for grabs like never before”.If Boris Johnson has one proven gt, it is for winning against the odds.

Shes the absolute jigger queen.”In stomach-churning scenes Cilian, who remains unflinching, digs out the worm with sharpened wooden stick as Livia explains it has been in her foot for a few days and “its managed to gnaw right through me and create a great big sack of eggs.As the white egg sack oozes out of her skin, she exclaims, “Look at the size of that beast. She [Cilian] absolutely loved that though.”Despite her medical skills, Cilian will not train to be a doctor as the Pygmy children never leave the village for formal education.The wealthier Bantu tribe consider themselves a superior race and have historically kept Pygmies as slaves.A report in  found that the Pygmy tribes were subject to constant discrimination from the Bantus, being made to work for nothing and are “considered by Bantu people as property in the same way that pets are.Livia explains: [Their village] Bonguinda used to be inhabited by the Pygmies and the Bantus.The Bantus moved down to the river to the neighbouring village of Munbalu but this is still Bantu land so they still feel like they have a bit of a hold on [the Pygmies].The relationship between them is really dark.Extreme Tribes: The Last Pygmies airs tonight at pm on Channel .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive.In a joint statement issued ahead of the meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support, but added that all stakeholders should pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions.Speaking ahead of Mondays meeting, Mr Hunt said: The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, butthe dferent parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind.Neighbouring Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would likely want to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, with the potential to obliterate entire cities, experts have warned.Recent statements from Saudi Arabia has made it clear the country would not accept a nuclear-armed Iran.Iran, meanwhile, has begun exceeding limits on uranium enrichment agreed in the  deal amid frustration in Tehran at theof crippling US economic sanctions.While the Europeans say they still support the agreement - which lted sanctions infor Iran curbing its nuclear programme - in practice they have found it dficult to get round the US measures.The nuclear agreement, agreed upon in , involved a pledge from Iran to reduce its uranium enrichment programme infor a loosening of economic sanctions.The  deal caps Iran’s levels of uranium enriched to . per cent purity—called “low-enriched uranium”.This type of uranium is only suitable for producing fuel for nuclear power reactors—at  kilograms.Highly enriched uranium is needed to produce a nuclear weapon.Obtaining fissile material - such as uranium and plutonium - is widely regarded as the most dficult task in building nuclear weapons.Iran would need , kilograms of low-enriched uranium to make the core of one bomb.This would need to be further enriched, to  per cent purity, using centruges until it had about  kilograms of what is called “highly enriched uranium.”Experts estimate that it would take about a year for Tehran to enrich enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb.This time frame has been backed up by a May  US Congressional Research Report.However other weapons experts have been more hesitant to say Iran is building a nuclear weapon geared to attack.Ky Davenport, the director of nonproleration policy at the Arms Control Association, told Foreign Policy in July: “This is not a dash to a nuclear bomb ... It is a calculated move designed to gain leverage in negotiations with the Europeans, Russia, and China on sanctions relief.”President Trump last year pulled the US out of the agreement - claiming Tehran was violating its obligations and suggesting the deal was too soft.He also threatened to impose the highest level of economic sanction against Iran.The other parties criticised Mr Trumps decision and said they remained committed to the deal.The United States has assessed that Tehran possesses the technological and industrial capacity toBut Iran has not yet mastered all of the necessary technologies for building such weapons.Whether Iran has a viable design for a nuclear weapon is unclear.Although Iran claims that its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes, the programLast week, a Royal Navy warship intervened to drive off Iranian patrol boats after they approached a British tanker as it sailed through the Strait of Hormuz.It prompted fears the Iranians were trying to seize a UK ship in retaliation for the detention of the Grace .It was the latest in a series of incidents in the region prompting fears of a slide into all out conflict.In recent weeks, the US has sent thousands of troops, an aircraft carrier, nuclear-capable B- bombers and advanced fighter jets to the Middle East.Iran has also pledged to breach the agreement until it receives the sanctions relief it says it is owed.The deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.It saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by  per cent.Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties - a type of nuclear reactor which uses heavy wateras a coolant to maintain temperatures in the reactor.Also under the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities to ensure Iran maintains the deal.If Iran abided by the deal it was promised relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The agreement was reached on July , , and the world powers signed it in Vienna.The Iran nuclear deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.The deal saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by  per cent.Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties -

What must the person on the mat behind me be seeing of my nether regions  This is the stuff of nightmares for many, but for naturists, the ultimate summer getaway.Welcome to the th annual NudeFest, the “Glastonbury of the naturist calendar”, where  naturists descend on Somerset for a week-long celebration of nakedness.And this year I’ve somehow ended up being a punter. No age limit, families welcome — clothes optional.First rule of Nudefest, don’t say “nudist”, the correct term is “naturist”. Second rule, keep your gaze at eye level.Third, don’t get any funny ideas — this £-a-night experience is a family show.Being naked doesn’t sit easy with me. I didn’t grow up in a “naked household” and the last adult human to see me in the altogether was my waxer, before that my ­gynaecologist.When I arrive it has just started to rain, so rather anti-climatically there are a lot more clothes than I had prepared myself for.I meet my mentor, Pam, a -year-old heading up the youth contingent of British Naturism, and she says I can undress in her tent. She doesn’t even buy me a drink first.I slip off everything and cover myself with a towel. I meet two boys about my age and am starkly aware I will later see their genitals.This is weird, but slightly thrilling . . . I think how much I don’t want them to see my bum. Pants off, we head over to the main area and straight to the bar for Dutch courage.I know it’s time to drop the towel, I didn’t drive three hours to Somerset to bottle it now. And so, in front of a class of naked adults learning how to make balloon animals, I bare all.Suddenly, I am Keith Chegwin in Naked Jungle. In a bid to distract myself, I join in the balloon session — and resist the searing urge to make a quip about the sausage-shaped balloons.A few hours in and, despite ­fearing it may be against naturist etiquette, I question the obvious trend for a fuzz-free look down below. One man deadpans: “I’ve got a smaller penis so trim the hairs so they don’t get stuck”.I meet Graham, , at the bar. After losing his we five years ago he has immersed himself in the scene. He even drives naked — pay-at-the-pump has been a blessing.Graham likes to walk outdoors naked. If I was walking my dog and saw a very naked Graham walking towards me, I would probably call the police.When I tell him this, he reveals he has started to carry a dog lead, despite not owning a dog, to show he comes in peace and to avoid any confusion.But this is the crux of where naturism is misunderstood — your bits might be out, but there is nothing overwhelmingly sexual about it. I have had smear tests that were more arousing, I think, during Pilates.Mark, a university lecturer by day who took the pictures for this article, sums it up perfectly when he tells me: “Naturism is about the freedom to choose, and whether you choose clothes or a burqa, it’s about being true to you.”The Pilates instructor later says she thought I was a seasoned naturist. I feel a swell of pride, before flashbacks to the downward dog when I almost concussed myself with my own boobs. Downwards dog ears, perhaps a more accurate description.The staff on site are not naturists, so does the clay pigeon instructor feel left out  It’s a strong no. But a ­twinkle in his eye hints he is curious — though maybe it was because I was resting my bosom on his gun.At the rock-climbing, I slip into the harness. It serves as a sort of spreading vice and I almost certainly give an involuntary gynaecological showcase to those queuing at the bottom.I question a health and safety system that says no bare feet but gusset optional. Things reach critical levels of surreal when we spy a chap wearing nothing but a Robin Hood cap teaching archery. Along with Pam, I join in.When I ask some younger naturistsanything ever happens after nightfall, a -year-old man, who is yet to tell his family about his hobby, says: “Most people take their clothes off when they’re drunk, I put them on.”Then I drop my first clanger, telling Sian, a NudeFest volunteer: “I don’t know why people have a problem with it. It’s not like you’re all a bunch of swingers.”I suddenly feel naked in the middle of a party . . . and realise I am. I ask a man called Paul, who has an impressive body painting of a lion on his belly, why he didn’t go a bit lower and get an elephant.My joke falls flat . Could it be that naturists are discretely quite prudish  I feel a little flutter when a good-looking, strawberry blond man walks by with the most gorgeous bum.Yes, I do fancy him. And yes, more because I can see everything. Is all this nakedness truly totally devoid of sexuality — andnaturism is not about objectying certain body parts, how do you explain a TV show like Naked Attraction Pam tells me: “There is an inverse insecurity of watching a show like that — it just shows how obsessed we are with bodies and comparison.” I spot a unormed police officer doing the rounds and can’t help but think how overdressed he looks.It becomes clear that naturists don’t care two hoots what anyone  thinks of them. For this, I start to appreciate them even more.A volunteer in his s tells me: “People who ridicule us don’t have the guts. All my friends and family admire me for being able to do this.”But that’s the point that mentor Pam makes so brilliantly — we aren’t a sum of our body parts. And that’s what true naturism is all about.She says: “If you’ve got a s**t personality you’ll stand out — because here you have nothing to hide behind.”I begin to envy her true-self acceptance and body confidence. I definitely hate my bum more as the day wobbles on, instead of feeling less self-conscious about it. At the end of the day, I put on my knickers, thank Pam and say I’ll message her when I get home.It’s like the end of a one-night stand. I hope she messages me. For the patrons of Nudefest, it is good, clean, wholesome fun celebrating people for who they are not what they look like.I want to say I felt liberated. But I didn’t, just wobbly. However I did feel totally respected.Pam’s openness and frankness is refreshing, and while I’m still scratching to get beneath the surface of my own body issues, I would love nothing more than a drink in the pub with this lot.I go home with no washing and no tan lines and wonder, could I get used to this Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I would say that I came in as a Boris fan but having listened to both I think they both gave good performances, but Jeremy just filled me with a bit more confidence.Both would do a good job, and Id be happy to see either of them in the role.I think Boris will get it done quicker, but Jeremy will get it done better.Insiders believe Johnson is “home and dry” with a week to go until the deadline for Tory voters to have their say in the election.But addressing the audience of Sun readers in the heart of London, Hunt insisted he was not far apart from his rival when it came to delivering Brexit by the new deadline of October .He added: “Both of us want to leave by October . Both of us hope Parliament won’t block a No Deal Brexit.”And both men committed to handing at least one of the top four jobs in their Cabinet to women days after Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she had now “accepted” No Deal had to remain on the table.Asked to guarantee he would award the job of either Chancellor, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary or Defence Secretary to a woman, Johnson dithered before saying: “I think I’m going to say yes, depending on what you mean by top four.”"},{"url":null,"title":"miracle conjoined twins separated at great ormond 50 hrs surgery 100 staff","story":"Safa and Marwa Ullah were born by C-section with their skulls and blood vessels fused together.But the two-year-olds can now move independently after three major ops at Great Ormond Street.The first took place in October , when the girls, from Charsadda, Pakistan, were  months old. And the last operation, which saw them finally separated, was carried out on February  this year.In order to ensure the operations went smoothly, experts used virtual reality to create an exact replica of the girls’ anatomy.This enabled surgeons to visualise the complex structure of their skulls as well as the positioning of their brains and blood vessels.A team also used D printing to create plastic models of the structures that could be used for practice. Cutting guides were created so that surgeons could work more precisely.During the surgery, doctors first worked to separate the girls’ blood vessels and then inserted a piece of plastic into their heads to keep the brains and blood vessels apart.The final major operation involved medics building new skulls using the girls’ own bone. They also used tissue expanders to ensure the girls’ own skin would stretch over the top of each of their heads.The surgery, which was paid for by a private donor, has been followed by several smaller procedures to enable the girls to live independent lives.The operations added up to more than  hours of surgery time and involved  members of staff from Great Ormond Street.The girls’ mum, Zainab Bibi, , said: “We are indebted to the hospital and to the staff and we would like to thank them for everything they have done. We are extremely excited about the future.”The girls, whose father has died, were discharged from Gosh on July  and moved to a London address with their mum, grandad Mohammad Sadat, , and an uncle.The twins are now undergoing daily physiotherapy as part of their ongoing rehabilitation.Neurosurgeon Noor ul Owase Jeelani and craniofacial surgeon Prof David Dunaway led the team that operated on the girls.They said in a statement: “We are delighted we have been able to help Safa and Marwa and their family. It has been a long and complex journey for them, and for the clinical team looking after them.“From our personal point of view, it has been great to get to know the girls and their family.Their faith and determination have been so important in getting them through the challenges they have faced.We are incredibly proud of them. We are also incredibly proud of the Gosh team responsible for their treatment and care over the past  months.“From the surgical teams, scientists and engineers who helped us plan and perform the operations to the paediatricians, nursing staff, physiotherapists and occupational therapistsIt has been a huge team effort and every single person has played a key part in helping Safa and Marwa.“Gosh really is one of the few hospitals in the world with the infrastructure and expertise to carry out a separation like this successfully.”Conjoined twins are very rare, affecting only about one in every .million births. Just  per cent of conjoined twins are craniopagus, which means they are joined at the head.Gosh has successfully separated craniopagus twins in  and .

It has threatened journalists, too, that they face prosecutionthey dare to publish the content of the cables.Trying to justy his threats, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner, Neil Basu, said he was sure the leaks had “damaged UK international relations” and on that basis no one publishing the leaks could plead a public interest defence.What a ludicrous over-reaction to what is really no more than a diplomatic spat over the Ferrero Rochers.Sure, it doesn’t exactly help UK US relations when our Ambassador calls the President of the United States “inept” and his administration “uniquely dysal”.But I would say it is mildly less damaging than some of the things that the Leader of Opposition, the Mayor of London and Scotland’s First Minister have said about Donald Trump. I can’t see Mr Basu dangling his handcuffs in front of them — and neither should he.Obviously, Sir Kim has reason to feel aggrieved that someone — presumably in the diplomatic service or the Foreign Office, because there is no evidence of computers being hacked — has leaked information he intended to be private. But it is a matter for the Government to investigate, not the police.How ridiculous Basu has said of the leaker: “You are now also responsible for erting busy detectives from under-taking their core mission.”No, Mr Basu — it is only thanks to your decision that officers have been taken off front-line duties to undertake this investigation.You could have told officials what police officers are forever telling the rest of us when we report our houses broken into or our bikes stolen: Sorry, but we’ve got too much  to do.It would be a dferent mattersomeone had leaked material that really did harm national security.The sort of information leaked by Kim Philby and his Soviet-sympathising accomplices in the s put British lives at risk.But leaking and publishing a diplomat’s private thoughts hardly comes into that category. Mr Basu’s attack on the principles of the free Press echoes Operation Elveden, the failed attempt by the Met to criminalise journalists who had obtained information from police officers, in some cases for money.The Met switched more than  police officers from other duties and arrested  people. The police probe cost taxpayers £.million and yet of  journalists charged, only one was convicted at trial — and that was quashed on appeal. Just one journalist, Dan Evans, pleaded guilty to an Elveden offence and was given a suspended sentence.The prosecutions relied on an ancient offence, Misconduct in Public Office, which was only ever supposed to apply to public servants, not journalists.As many lawyers, including the Lord Chief Justice, pointed out, it simply isn’t a criminal offence for someone to receive or to publish most forms of state information — only for a public official to sell it.There is a very good reason for this. Leaks, and the freedom to put their contents into the public domain, are an essential ingredient of our democracy. It is what helps the Press to keep in check corrupt or over-bearing politicians and public officials.Without the freedom to publish leaked information, for example, we would never have known the extent to which MPs and Lords were abusing their expenses regime.That required a newspaper to publish information gleaned from a computer disk which had been stolen — but thankfully in that case the Met decided that the public interest over-rode a possible offence of handling stolen goods.Without the Panama Papers we would never have known the extent to which wealthy iniduals and corporations have gone into keeping their wealth out of the taxman’s grasp.

It was a wide ranging conversation - covering tax, immigration andthe US President is a racist. This is what we learned    Neither Boris or Jeremy will say Trump is a racistBoth refused to brand comments from Donald Trump that non-white lawmakers who have criticised him should go home as racist.  The President said four non-white congresswomen should “go back and help fix” their “broken and crime-infested” countries.Only one of the quartet was born outside America. Mr Huntaposs said the comments were unacceptable.   He added that as the father of three half Chinese children that he was totally appalled before adding that he hoped it would never happen in this country. But asked to condemn it as racist he said: It is not going to help the situation to use that type of language about the president of the United States.

The programme - shown on Wednesday - included claims that senior figures including Mr Corbynaposs communications chief Seumas Milne and general secretary Jennie Formby had interfered in anti-Semitism investigations.    In its response, Labour said the allegations came from disaffected former officials opposed to Mr Corbynaposs leadership who had personal and political axes to grind casting doubt on their credibility as sources. Boris Johnson defended his tax cuts for the wealthiest Mr Johnson said it was odd that people had criticised his plan to cut taxes for high earners. I do think it is a bit odd that thereaposs been so much controversy, he said, when you consider that there are police inspectors, there are senior nurses, there are heads of maths departments who are now being captured paying the higher rate of tax.    He continued: Iaposm one of those that people basically should wherever possible be able to spend their own money as much as they can. He was unclear over whether it remained a policy or a subject for debate.

Demand for emergency aid over the six-week break soared by a fth last year compared with  months earlier. Volunteers are expecting a fresh surge from families whose kids receive free school meals during term-time. Heartbreaking figures revealed today Each parcel contains enough food for three meals a day for three days – meaning more than three quarters of a million meals were provided.  Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “Foodbanks will do all they can to help families over the summer, with many running holiday clubs to support parents who find that their income simply won’t stretch to meet the extra pressure of missing free school meals or paying for additional childcare during the holidays. “But no charity can replace the dignity of having enough money for the basics. “While it’s great to see schemes in place to tackle holiday hunger, foodbanks and other emergency food provision cannot, and must not, be a long term solution to poverty. “Ultimately, we should all be protected from needing a foodbank’s help, no matter the time of the year.  “No child should face going hungry in the UK.” Foodbanks traditionally experience spikes in demand over the summer break - and centres often give away more food than is donated. In July and August , , tonnes of food were handed into Trussell Trust foodbanks, while , tonnes of food were distributed - a dference of  tonnes.  The necessity for extra support during the summer is triggered by kids who usually get free school meals needing to be fed at home instead. That piles additional pressure on stretched household budgets, forcing more hard-up families to seek help. A report from Parliament’s cross-party group on hunger last year estimated the loss of free school meals during the holidays adds between £ and £ a week to parents’ outgoings for one child.  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “It is simply wrong that families should have to rely on foodbanks to feed their children at any time. “The extra costs families face during school holidays can often push them into severe hardship. “The high level of housing costs, the spread of low paid, insecure work and deep cuts to social security have left families struggling to meet basic household bills.  “The Government cannot simply abdicate responsibility for families being pushed into poverty and children going hungry in the summer.” Lib Dem Work and Pensions spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: “The number of people relying on foodbanks is a shocking indictment on this Conservative Government. “The Conservatives have presided over a toxic mix of social security cuts that have left thousands of people unable to afford the basics.“The benefits freeze and cuts to Universal Credit have left a growing number of households are on the brink."},{"url":null,"title":"couple face having home repossessed","story":"NewsCouple face having home repossessed after disagreement with neighbour over HEDGERon and Wendy Long have been threatened with an order of possession and sale of their home after they were unable to pay neighbours £, court costs following a legal disputeShareCommentsByLaura Elvin:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsRon and Wendy Long face having their home taken from them \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA retired couple face having their home possessed and forcibly sold by their neighbour - after an disagreement over a privet HEDGE. Grandparents Ron and Wendy Long were devastated when they found workmen chopping down a hedge between their home and neighbour Diana Lambethaposs. Ron, , claimed the fence posts they half-installed were on his land, and wrote letters asking her to consult with him on the plans. But instead she took the elderly couple to court, in pursuit of an injunction to stop them interfering with the hedge, in Swanage, Dorset. An independent expert decided the boundary was in the middle of the old hedge - and the Longs agreed in a bid to end the matter.    But despite the Longs representing themselves in court, the judge ordered Ron and Wendy pay Mrs Lambethaposs court costs - £,. Without any money to pay, they were hauled back to court and the charge was placed on their £, three-bed home. Last month they were told Mrs Lambeth intends to take them to court for an order of possession and sale of their home to sell it herself to get the cash. And her lawyers have warned Ron and Wendy theyaposll ask the judge to make the couple pay the legal costs incurred. Retired flooring contractor Ron, said: Weaposve done nothing wrong, we broken no laws, and we followed all the advice we could find - yet we find ourselves in this situation.    When you say all this is over a garden fence, people canapost believe it. Iaposm not out to get revenge. I donapost want to give my neighbour grief. I donapost want to shame my neighbours, but I want to make people aware of what can happen to you. We never thought this could happen to us. We never thought someone could take our home over a hedge. I just want to show people what can happen when solicitors get involved and things go to court. All I want is some help to bring this to a close. We donapost want someone  to sell our home. We feel like we have been stepped all over and nobody has heard our side of things. Ron and Wendy, a housewe, bought their three-bed home in . On friendly terms with neighbour Mrs Lambeth, keen gardener Ron happily maintained his side of the hedge between their homes, he said. But he came home in May  from a morning out to find three workmen in his garden, he claims.    They had cut down half the hedge and piled it in the middle of his garden and were replacing it with fence posts, some of which he said were on his side, he said. I hadnapost given permission for anyone to come on my garden, said Ron. There were great big roots left. Instead of the new fence posts being straight, they were taking the posts around the roots. It looked a mess. Iaposm fond of gardening and I like it to look neat and tidy. Andshe was putting up a fence to keep her dog in, it wasnapost the right sort of fence to do that anyway. It was only a metre high. I told them to stop. He went inside, did some research online and penned a letter to his neighbour, telling her they should have been consulted on the fence location. He said the new fence posts were on his property, but apologised for the letter, assuring his neighbour we hope we can resolve this amicably. But in the coming weeks, the Longs woke up to find someone had removed the rest of the fence while they were asleep. He sent her another letter urging her to sort this out in a civilised fashion.  But after months of letters, the couple were named as the defendants in a County Court boundary dispute claim. According to court documents from June , Mrs Lambeth claimed they were preventing her from putting a fence up. She asked the court to seek a declaration of the boundary, an injunction stopping the Longs from obstructing the fence building, going on her property, or altering any fence. The Longs claim the judge urged them to sort the case outside of court. Fearful and unable to afford a solicitor, they said they agreed in court to the fence, in May . I just didnapost want to take it any further - we never wanted it to get that far, said Ron. But their solicitor just took over. Every time I tried to say anything I got told to sit down. We just didnapost have a chance. I said aposput your boundary wherever you likeapos. They were astonished when the judge ordered all the claimants costs - £,. - were to be covered by them. They hired a solicitor and they hired an expert, but in this very brief hearing itaposs ordered that we have to pay for it all, he said. I could barely take it in. I didnapost - and we still donapost - know what itaposs all for. Their solicitor presented this huge bundle of paperwork and we were handed the bill.  But they werenapost able to pay in full, and were hauled back to court and the charge was transferred to their home in November last year. The couple were already selling their home before the saga started, but took it off the market when the dispute went to court. With it back on the market, they thought the ordeal was behind them. We thought weaposd have to pay back the money when we sold the house, he said. We had a brief moment of calm and thought it was all over. But earlier last monththey received a legal letter from their neighbouraposs solicitors. It states they have been instructed to apply to the court for an order for possession and sale of the Longaposs home, in order to enforce the courtaposs charging order for the debt. The Longs said they canapost get a loan due to the CCJ they incurred by not paying the costs on time. They said they havenapost been able to get help from the Citizens Advice Bureau and solicitors have been reluctant to take on the case.

The mum added: We first saw them at the airport. They were wearing T-shirts with his name on, along with a picture of a man appearing to perform a sex act on another man. My nine-year-old son asked what the picture was and we just told him it was a funny picture. At first they just seemed to be having a good time. As soon as we stepped on the plane it was obvious they were going to get rowdy. I felt sorry for the cabin crew who dealt with the incident very well.  The group was warned over the Tannoy before we left the gate that it wasnapost too late for them to be offloaded, but they cheered at the announcement. They couldnapost care a less. The language being used was disgusting and disgraceful. There was no awareness of other pasengers. At one point one of the men started hammering on the side of the plane. He was punching the wall. I was worried and then he said aposIaposm going. aposIaposm getting off the planeapos. He walked down towards the cabin crew and I thought he was going to open the door. It was horric and I was terried. The crew pleaded with him to sit down.    Another passenger, who was flying with her husband, told how quick-thinking cabin crew stopped him. His friend said aposdonapost be an idiotapos and cabin crew used the drinks trolley to block him. He was falling over. He picked a can from the trolley and went back to his seat and just fell asleep. Passengers have praised the Ryanair cabin crew who remained calm and composed on Flight FR. The crew were fantastic. We thanked them. They were very good. From what I understand the stag group said they had come down from Aberdeen. They were loud at the airport. Iaposm not a prude but their language was quite shocking. They were using F-words and the C-word. It wasnapost directed at anyone but they got louder and and louder. We were boarding and were hoping that we were sitting a long way away from them but when we got to our seats we were right in the middle of them. I fly a lot but I almost got off the plane.  They were getting increasingly aggressive. They refused to take their seats when asked and were bragging about taking d*** pics. This was before we had even taken off. It was intimidating. The cabin crew made an announcement that it wasnapost too late to get them off the flight. It appeared that they had smuggled their own alcohol on the plane. They kept needing to use the toilet even when the seatbelt sign was on. They didnapost do anything they were told and the pilot in the end kept the seatbelt sign on in an attempt to try and keep them in their seats. In the end the cabin crew moved us. One of the group then started verbally abusing a male member of staff and kept calling him a aposnonceapos. He was screaming in the manaposs face. He was directed back to his seat but kept coming back. At one point he sat in the lap of a woman. It was offensive. Everyone was saying it was the worst flight ever. It was frightening and deeply uncomfortable. I was scared. It was really, really scary. It was the worst kind of disorder you can imagine apart from the fact it was happening ,ft in the air and there was nothing we could do. When the flight landed passengers were told to remain in their seats so police could come on the plane. The police met us when we landed. One of the group thought he would just ignore the instruction and saw his opportunity to get off the plane quickly, said another passenger. But when he walked down the steps he was met by officers. The rest of his group thought it was hilarious.

Kasim Lewis, , was jailed for le with a minimum term of  years last May for the murder of -year-old Iuliana Tudos on Christmas Eve . He attacked Ms Tudos with a broken bottle in Finsbury Park, London, as she walked home after a sht at the Worldaposs End pub in Camden. Her naked body was found, with a suspected Batman logo carved into her chest, in a burned-out hut in the park three days after she disappeared.  Following his conviction for her murder, Lewisaposs DNA was linked to the death of Catherine Burke, who was stabbed to death in her own home in Haringey a month before. At a hearing at the Old Bailey on Monday, Lewis pleaded guilty to the murder of Ms Burke on November  . The -year-old mother of one and retired civil servant was found dead by police after concerned neighbours raised the alarm. Police found DNA linking the defendant to the scene and tracked Ms Burkeaposs mobile phone in the direction of where he was living.    Explicit pornographic material was also found on the defendantaposs mobile phone, the court had heard at an earlier hearing. Lewis, who was addicted to drugs and diagnosed as HIV positive in , had a number of convictions for sexual offences and was on a sex offenders register for le. Judge Richard Marks QC adjourned sentencing at the Old Bailey until Thursday. When he sentenced Lewis, from the Caribbean island of Montserrat, for Ms Tudosapos murder, Judge Marks described Lewis as aposwicked beyond beliefapos.    He added: This was a murder for gain. What is however, in dispute is whether this case should be categorised as a murder involving sexual or sadistic conduct. There must have been a sexual element, evenfor some reason that was not something that was persisted in. There is no doubt that this was a killing that involved the most appalling brutality as the photographs demonstrate. It is a killing that has been rightly described as horrendous and barbaric.    At the time of the attack, this slightly built young woman was alone in a park at night and as such, vulnerable in the extreme as you unquestionably realised. She must have died a terrible death and what you did to her was wicked beyond belief. The court had heard how Lewis carved either the Batman logo or the letter aposMapos into the middle of Ms Tudosaposs chest. The killer was a bisexual who was in a relationship with a man but prowled Finsbury Park to satisfy his cravings for casual sex. He had a fascination with sadism and had a pornographic film on his phone called aposStep Sisters Caughtapos. Among the trailers was one entitled aposBad Teens Punishedapos where a young woman is chased into an alleyway by a man who says: She ainapost getting away again.

The house boasts dozens of stylish rooms, including six bedrooms, each designed completely dferently - from the saloon and space-inspired kitchen to floral staircases and unicorns in the garden. Amy, an artist and creative director originally from Calornia, USA, said: It is inspired by the past, the present and the future as well as more specic things such as art, fashion, music, nature, the universe and of course overall the king of emotion and answer to pretty much everything - love.    Itaposs hard for me personally to comment on what it is like to experience the house as an outsider because I created it and it is my reality. The feedback we get from many guests is that it is an aspirational and inspirational place that is often described a dreamlike and otherworldly escape. The amazing house is available to stay in and hire out by making contact through their website. It has been used for television opportunities, photo shoots and music videos. It was recently featured in Little Mixaposs aposBounce Backapos music video.    Amy added: There is no specic price tag for hiring the dream house each quote is tailored depending on whether it is for commercial or personal use, how many guests there are, and what optional extras are asked for. Guests attending have to be over  but this can y depending on the kind of event that is hosted and the occasion. The quirky house includes lots of funky features such as leopard print wallpaper, floral walls, a pink quilted bed and a waterfall painted on the back of the house.  Amy added: Almost all of our furniture is recycled from charity shops which I like to support, as well as car boot sales, and eBay, I prefer to buy things secondhand as they have a story and so much character, I am naturally drawn to that sort of history. Iaposm obsessed with making things so Iaposve made a lot of it too! Every room is my favourite for dferent reasons, but ultimately I see the house as one piece and a total experience. It is a privilege as an artist to be able to create something on this scale and I appreciate every day.  Fortunately, as time has passed, the neighbours now have a better understanding of what the houseaposs creative purpose is and it has become a part of Tiptree. Iaposm very excited for whataposs next - the time has come to move one and create something new.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal.

Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore.

This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

So more than ,likely to be with an adoption problem.\"Ever since  Scottish councils have taken over privately built roads from housing developers - as long as they meet standards.Public sector insiders stress that adoption can be a long and drawn-out process as roads officials pressurise developers to get their streets up to scratch.Cash-strapped councils already have a huge backlog in roads and lighting repairs and do no want to take on extra work and costs that should have been done by private builders.Getting precise figures on how many people or homes are affected by non-adopted roads is almost impossible.That is because dferent councils count the issue in dferent ways. Glasgow, for example, as of , had  development sites were roads were not adopted. Neighbouring East Dunbartonshire had  developments with around  homes. Falkirk, again as of , had one road that was still to be adopted  years after it was built.This is on top of the many pre- private roads already scattered across Scotland - where homeowners are expected to pay the upkeep.Stewart Turner, of the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, chairs the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland. He said: \"Owners of private roads may request that their road be adopted by the roads authority and provided this road joins the public road and it is to a standard acceptable to the roads authority, then it would be adopted.\"Also roads authorities may ask the frontagers of private roads to make improvement and they may,they consider appropriate, contribute to this cost. \"Throughout Scotland the ious Roads Authorities have a dferent approach to this power.\"However taking into account the Roads Authoritiesrsquo primary responsibility to maintain the public roads then it is considered important that the available resource is directed to the public roads. Additional financial resource would be required to improve the extensive private road network.\"Mr Sutton has been in a y correspondence with the Scottish Government over what he sees as its failure to keep track of the scale of the issue.A spokesman for the government said: \"We do not collect information on roadsrsquo adoption status, as that is a matter for local authorities, who are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of roads they have adopted.\"Un-adopted or private roads are the responsibility of housing developers or private home owners, who should consult their relevant local authority on adoption arrangements.\""},{"url":null,"title":"donald-findlay-qc-talks-distressing-toll-work","story":"But Donald Findlay QC has, for the first time, told of the toll his work has taken, describing it as at times \"distressing\".The flamboyant advocate - known for puffing on his pipe and for his mutton-chop sideburns - has lead the defence in some of Scotlands most infamous murder cases, including Peter Tobin and Luke Mitchell.Now , he has also offered insight into the inspiration for his decision to pursue such a career, going back to his childhood in the s when he first read about the Scottish serial killer, Peter Manuel.Findlay, who hails from Cowdenbeath, Fe, opens up in a new BBC Scotland series, Crime Files, which begins on Sunday.Interviewed by renowned Scots criminologist, Professor David Wilson, he hints at harbouring regret over allowing his job to become his le - but suggests that it is now too late to change his ways.:Craig Whyte defender Donald Findlay named as highest earning legal aid advocateldquoIrsquove never really acquired any hobbies or interests or anything outwith the job,\" he says.\"Itrsquos constantly just a part of my le and has now been so for well over  years.ldquoI tell young lawyers who want to become involved in crime, it is a vocation because itrsquos not easy to defend some of the things we have to defend and yoursquove got to do it with a passion and yoursquove got to do it with a vigour.ldquoBut at the same time, you shouldnrsquot do what Irsquove done and let it become the be-all and end-all.

As a seven-year-old, I read every word that was reported.\"The challenge of representing someone faced with so many serious charges is one of the reasons I became a defence lawyer.\"Findlay also says during the programme that the increasing use of science by prosecutors in court cases is a \"very real concern\", in part because some can form views by watching TV.He says: ldquoOne problem is, members of the public get a lot of their science from CSI: Miami and New York and all these kind of things. And thatrsquos not real. But thatrsquos the impression you get.ldquoPeople think itrsquos as simple as that but, of course, itrsquos not.

So how can we try and change our culture to a more cycling-friendly one Therersquos no quick solution to this one, but after infrastructure and enforcement, education is a key element of an effective road safety strategy because misconceptions and myths about cycling contribute to a culture of conflict on the roads.ldquoCyclists donrsquot pay road tax is a statement often used to explain why some people feel they, as drivers, have more rights on the roads. The reality is road tax ended in the s, and we all pay for the roads through general or local taxation.

Itrsquos legal to cycle in the middle of the lane and sometimes itrsquos the safest place, For instancethe road is narrow and itrsquos unsafe for a car to pass, when approaching a junction or to avoid potholes or doors of parked cars being opened in your path.We often hear the argument that bad behaviour, or perceived arrogance, from people cycling provokes careless or dangerous driving and that safety would improveldquocyclists behaved better. Red-light running, to take an oft-cited example of cycling behaviour, is wrong, whether cycling or driving, and too many people do it. But itrsquos not acceptable or logical to hold all people cycling responsible simply because they use the same mode of transport. ldquoCyclists are not a homogenous group but inidual people, just as drivers are.The fact is that many people who cycle are being intimidated, injured or worse, while cycling correctly.

Driving too close is a careless or dangerous driving offence because it can kill or seriously injure someone.Almost everyonersquos behaviour ndash including some people who cycle ndash has room for improvement to create a cycle of acceptance, and remove the perception of two tribes going to war on the roads or shared use paths.ldquoWhat about them  Deal with their behaviour first  is never an excuse for careless or dangerous behaviour by anyone. Myths and misconceptions about people cycling need to be banished and enforcement has to focus on the behaviours with greatest potential for harm, just as the Police Operation Close Pass does. Expanding cycling infrastructure is the key priority, creating dedicated space for cycling, to the benefit of everyone.We have a long way to go but quick change is possible. With the increased investment in cycle infrastructure, an increased focus on access to bikes, and greater education and understanding to create a cycle of acceptance, a cycling-friendly nation is no longer an impossible dream."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-tensions-london-edinburgh-going-get-far-worse","story":"Discovering how well this had gone down with the easily pleased hacks, Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy tried to outdo him the following year by providing a slap-up curry at his own festive bash.This was before austerity started to bite and relationships soured: by the time Mr Salmond left office, journalists were treated to bowls of crisps in the basement of St Andrewrsquos House.:Marianne Taylor: The SNP is right to back abortion in Northern IrelandBut during the three years when Scotland had an SNP government in Edinburgh, and a Labour government in Westminster, there was a newfound rivalry between the Scottish Government and the Scotland Office.Until Mr Murphy took over, the job of Scottish Secretary had ndash literally ndash been part-time.When the future Scottish Labour leader was appointed by Gordon Brown, it became the full-time role it is today.According to SNP figures, communications staffing costs for the Scotland Office have soared from around pound, in - to over pound, a decade later, and yesterday there was a fresh row about the departmentrsquos spending on overseas travel.The Nationalists have said this is justication to abolish the department, complaining that itrsquos spending public money \"pumping out propaganda\" promoting Scotlandrsquos place in the UK.The reality, of course, is that this is what governments do. The Scottish Government is also spending public money promoting Scotland with its effective \"Scotland is Now\" tourism campaign ndash ostensibly aimed at a global market, but clearly serving a dual purpose by suggesting to the domestic market that Scotlandrsquos values are distinct.The political tensions that started under Salmond and Murphy have continued, with present incumbent David Mundell facing near-weekly calls from the SNP to resign, often without much of an explanation as to why he should fall on his sword.Intergovernmental relations between the UK and Scottish governments are \"under pressure like never before\", according to SNP MP Pete Wishart.Mr Wishart acknowledged that work between civil servants is \"conducted perfectly well\", and that is certainly what those behind the scenes insist is the case.If there is a problem, then, itrsquos among the politicians, and thatrsquos hardly surprising ndash and not really anything new.It takes two to tango.:Scottish Government cannot guarantee medicine supplies under no-deal BrexitThe SNPrsquos well-worn narrative about a dysal Westminster system doesnrsquot stand up to scrutinythe political leaders work in harmony together. There is every reason for the SNP to be perfectly happy that intergovernmental relations are considered \"under pressure like never before\".After all, the Scottish Governmentrsquos stated aim is independence and the abolition of intergovernmental relations with the UK.But the UK Governmentrsquos stated aim is to preserve the Union, so it is unsurprising that the role of the Scotland Office has steadily increased over the years.Andtensions are strained now, itrsquos only going to get far worse.One of Theresa Mayrsquos final acts of her premiership was to announce a review of the way the UK Government handles the current devolved settlement.That doesnrsquot mean a shake-up of powers as some initially thought it means a sht in mindset for every single UK Government department.Today, Whitehall civil servants are told to ensure their work fits in with the devolution arrangement ndash is the Scottish Government kept engaged  How does the Sewel Convention apply In the future, the questions will be: Does our work strengthen the Union  Or does it potentially advance the case of independence ndash andso, letrsquos think again.Will it make the UK civil service more politicised  Probably.But that happened long ago here in Scotland.Last year, the Scottish Tories complained that civil servants were contacting witnesses ahead of appearances at a Holyrood committee, and highlighted graphics being tweeted by Government accounts which \"used the SNPrsquos party political language\".Valid concerns at the time, but such complaints are likely to appear hypocritical in the near future.And itrsquos not just civil servants who are being told to change their mindset ndash Cabinet ministers are too.The message is clear:the Union is to be saved, the UK Government needs to loosen its purse strings in Scotland, as The Herald exclusively revealed last week.That includes splashing the cash in both reserved and devolved areas ndash the Edinburgh City Deal for example has delivered cash for the capitalrsquos university and the UK Government is helping fund Edinburghrsquos new concert hall, even though culture is devolved.The argument is that such a venue is of cultural importance for the entire UK. Expect much more of the same to follow.Current Chancellor Philip Hammond has been a bulwark against this ever since he moved into Number , arguing that itrsquos unfair on English taxpayers as Scotland already receives its share of funding through the Barnett formula.It means spending money twice over north of the Border, he complains, with some justication.But the order has now gone out loud and clear that this is the price to pay to save the Union.And nobody has done more to achieve this mindset change than David Mundell.He has spent years quietly and effectively persuading his Cabinet colleagues of the risk to the Union and explaining to Whitehall departments they must learn to understand devolution.Next week, just moments before Theresa Mayrsquos final PMQs before she heads to the palace will be the last Scottish Questions before summer.No fan of Boris Johnson, it could be Mr Mundellrsquos last appearance at the despatch box.ButPrime Minister Johnson wants to avoid going down in history as the man who lost the Union, he would be well advised to consider keeping Mr Mundell in post.He should ask himself who does Nicola Sturgeon want as Scottish Secretary  The assured David Mundell or a maverick like Ross Thomson  The First Minister would surely prefer the latter.But whoever is Scottish Secretary, the role is now crucial to Scotlandrsquos constitutional future.Itrsquos a far cry from the part-time job it was before the SNP stormed to power.There will be more money to spend in Scotland far greater UK Government involvement in Scotland ndash and more explosive political rows with the SNP as a result.The great unknown is which government will emerge as the political winner in this latest constitutional battle."},{"url":null,"title":"worst-airline-uk-flight-delays-revealed","story":"The Spanish carrierrsquos UK departures were  minutes late on average in , according to analysis of Civil Aviation Authoritydata by the PA news agency.Thomas Cook Airlines was found to have the second worst performance with flights typically  minutes late, followed by Wizz Air , Norwegian Air UKand Eurowings .:Holidays from hell: your consumer rightsNorwegian Air UK is a British subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, operating transatlantic flights from Gatwick Airport.Cathay Pacic Airways is the most punctual airline, with aircraft typically taking off just eight minutes behind schedule.The average delay across all flights was  minutes.The ranking features the  airlines with more than , flights from UK airports last year.Average delay figures take into account every flight that operated, including those that were on time.

This is down two per cent from the  research. To put this into perspective, there has been a remarkable change in attitudes regarding same-sex relationships that only received full support by  per cent of those asked in . If this research is accurate, we have moved, in the space of a generation, from around one in  people thinking same sex relationships are not wrong at all to today when two thirds of people think this. But the suggestion is that this trend may be coming to an end.On the matter of the liberalisation of attitudes regarding the transgender community, the researchers say there is still some way to go, with only  per cent of those asked saying that they viewed prejudice against transgender people as lsquoalways wrongrsquo.One of the dficulties and indeed confusions with this research is the use of the term liberalism. When the survey began in  it was both liberal and radical to support gay rights. Lesbian and gay people continued to face police harassment, political and media condemnation, and pressure to remain in the closet. Consequently, gay liberation embodied a sentiment and a politics of liberation and freedom ndash freedom from the authorities, the censors and the police.Today in comparison, LGBT issues are often experienced as a form of outrage and offence taking ndash less a form of freedom than an imposition of lsquocorrectrsquo attitudes, of the censoring of speakers and academics, of Twitter storms demanding sackings and resignations, indeed as a matter of policing of words and attitudes with the full support of the political establishment. If there is a slow down in support for same-sex relationships, it may be less to do with the re-emergence of traditional views than a reaction against the illiberalism of todayrsquos ersity campaigners and police.In this regard, the fact that only  per cent of those surveyed said prejudice against transgender people is always wrong is of note. One would think this means there is a high level of bigotry and intolerance towards trans people. But on the contrary, despite this figure,  per cent of people also said that they are not prejudiced at all towards transgender people.When being liberal not only means allowing people to live as they please but being forced to accept something you do not believe, like the idea that men can be women and women can be men, then liberalism loses its meaning and we find that those who call themselves liberal are experienced as the new oppressors. In this respect many of these reactions in this survey do not reflect a loss of liberalism but a more genuine and liberal reaction to the new authoritarians."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-general-embarrassment","story":"WE asked for your stories about France following Bastille Day, and a Livingston reader tells us: \"On July , , having spent a fortnights holiday in Nice, we made our way to the taxi rank for a taxi to the airport.

I believe they couldnt win Ms Williams used towel, her brow sweat mopped on it between games,it was raffled off and only they had bought a ticket.Imagine knowing of the -time Grand Slam winners mph serve and, rather than thinking it would cleave their forehead in two, thinking, \"Easy.\"If youll excuse me, I have a lunchtime drag race with Lewis Hamilton and expect to be spending the afternoon on the winners podium with two young hunks and a bottle of Bolly.But of course not, because I am a woman and women tend not to have outrageous expectations of grandeur in the face of their own mediocrity. Shamefully, three per cent of women asked the same question re: Ms Williams and a quick tennis version of a kick about said they too would take a point.Still, it may not be zero but its a darn sight better than one in eight.We are in the grip of a highly visible spate of male self-aggrandisement. The President of the United States is an under-qualied, over-promoted balloon, telling congresswomen of colour that they should go back to where they came from. Dear God, lets hope they dontthe retort. If Trump arrives back to the Isle of Lewis well have to evacuate the islanders to safety.We look certain to have Trump Lite as our next prime minister, a Latin-spouting Boris Johnson, inappropriate at every turn. The two men, with their caricature hairstyles, the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of transatlantic cousins.When concerns are raised about closing the attainment gap or widening access in order to promote more young people from less well-off backgrounds and more women into senior positions, I often wonder why were not having a top down conversation.Why arent we asking how we thin out the numbers of mediocre men squatting in positions that could be more ably occupied by those who have merit, not over-confidence and connections.At the bottom of this masculine overachieving is a deep insecurity. An insecurity that comes from knowing men arent really necessary. They are merely a decorative addition to the planet, their only purpose their reproductive aid to the female. Dont email me: its science.Last month scientists revealed that men would be unnecessary should we come to colonise Mars. Sperm, it turns out, suffers no ill effects from microgravity.Researchers from Dexeus Womenrsquos Health in Barcelona showed that once sperm is collected and frozen, it will survive quite happily the trip into outer space.NASA has previously, according to Helen Sharman, the first Briton in space, looked into the optimum dynamics of crews in long-term space travel.Its research found it was best to have all male or all female teams.Women, it was found, would be the better option due to our superior cooperation skills.The boys, you see, would all be fussing over who was in charge. While men are found to be better at short, goal-oriented missions, for a task as time consuming as colonising space, you need women.We also take up fewer resources, given our typically smaller size so need less food, less oxygen and produce less waste. We suffer less from the worst physical side effects of spaceflight, such as sight loss.Most importantly, you cant populate another world without the female of the species while the males contribution can be stored for later use without the worst physical side effects of having to put up with men during the journey.The future of humanity lies in an intergalactic matriarchy, and isnt that enough to make the menfolk inclined to overstate their worth The YouGov poll demonstrates women have a far greater grip on reality than men, perhaps because of constantly having to justy ourselves. Say, the American footballer Megan Rapinoe. Male footballers engage in a iety of outrageous behaviours but lads will be lads.Ms Rapinoe fails to make eye contact with a fan as she signed a football and shes lambasted. In an attempt at charity, perhaps the men are demonstrating an impressive optimism.But... optimism needs its basis in reality. Reach for the stars, yes. Blindly rely on the notion of male meritocracy  No.There must be some part of the male psyche that realises that, while they try to undermine and belittle women, this is because they cant cope with the notion that women might be more than their equal.On balance, though, Id be perfectly happy for men to live in a fantasy world where they might beat a pre-eminent female sportswoman at her game based on nothing but self-delusion.It might distract them just enough from the delusion they could successfully run the country."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-brussels-far-preferable-westminster","story":"As for his suggestion that Scotlands laws will be controlled from Brussels, well, try telling that to the French or Germans or any of the other independent nations of Europe. The European court of Justice is fine by me, however its indicative of the controlling nature of the Westminster government that many there object to their ultimate control of Scottish laws being interfered with, but lets not forget that the European Union is a union of independent nations, unlike the United Kingdom.Mr Fitzpatrick is correct in suggesting that any treaty with other nations requires some loss of control. If he or anyone  thinks that abandoning our EU membership will give the UK more control of its future when negotiating with the US or China then they have another think coming. We currently have a voice in Brussels, we will have none in Washington, Beijing or even Brussels for that matter.As for an independent Scotland taking its orders from Brussels rather than Westminster, well thats OK by me. From where I sit Brussels looks like a beacon of good governance, compared to the basket case which is the UK governed by an English parliamentat Westminster.John Jamieson, Ayr.THE dficulty of Alan Fitzpatrickrsquos letter is summed up in one sentence, ldquoWhy can they not come clean and admit that by the former what they are seeking is separation from the UK, and by the latter they mean the substitution of control from Brussels to that at present from Westminster Westminster and Brussels are by no means identical. Westminster is an all-encompassing political union which can legislate on any matter it chooses, but the European Union is a treaty-based economic union with powers limited and controlled by member states. These include product standards and composition, product labelling, rights of movement and residence of EU citizens, company law, banking regulation, consumer protection, animal welfare, farm payments and managing the fish stocks in member statesrsquo fishing grounds. This sounds like a lot , however its main purpose is to ensure trade can be carried out fairly, and that for instance, no country attempts to achieve success by limiting employee rights or producing goods and services to a lower standard than others. It does not, however, include such as education, welfare, defence or foreign policies.Mr Fitzpatrickrsquos claim that the EU is on a ldquomarch hellip toward an ever-closer union is hypothetical at best, requiring the future agreement of the member states. In contrast Westminsterrsquos powers, within the UK, are to all intents infiniteLastly, he raises the issue that ldquoin the UK Scotland doesnrsquot get the government that they themselves voted for, how is that going to change in the EU  and there is no doubt that there would be times when the balance of members we elect to the European Parliament will not be reflected in its final majority. That though is not the most important point.The fact that one member of the UK ndash England ndash constitutes almost  per cent of the population meansthat there is clarity there about their aims then, pretty much no matter what the other member states think, they will achieve their aims. This could be clearly seen in the EU referendum, when evenwe deduct the Leave vote in Walesand in Northern Irelandthere would still be a majority for Leave in the UK! To repeat,there is a dference of opinion between the member states of the UK, England is well large enough to get its own way eventhere is only a slight majority there. Even Germany lacks that power in the EU. The UK is anything but a Union of equals.Mr Fitzpatrick claims that by ldquotake back control independence supporters mean ldquothe substitution of control from Brussels to that at present from Westminster, when the reality is we seek control ing to Scotland while sharing our sovereignty with the EU on its agreed range of issues, securing access to one of the worldrsquos largest markets, which the UK is minded to sacrice.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.ALAN Fitzpatrick is missing the point re dressing up spades. If Scotland were independent, we could decide to apply to join the EU or not - our choice. Whatever was decided, it would be Scotlands decision, no need to go cap in hand to Westminster to seek permission.That is taking back control: our decisions made by us and us alone.John McCallum, Glasgow.ALAN Fitzpatrick contends that Scotland would not be independenta member of the European Union by that reasoning, Mr Fitzpatrick must also believe that Denmark, Portugal, Finland, Estonia, Ireland and all the other EU member countries are not independent nations. I would remind Mr Fitzpatrick that during negotiations with the UK, every EU country had the right of veto, and all of them stood solidly behind Ireland in its particular set of circumstances, while Scotlands overwhelming vote to remain within the EU was pointedly ignored by the UK government at Westminster.And though membership of the EU is of vital importance to Scotland, there are other benefits of being an independent nation on the world stage Monaco, with a population of , actively participates in the United Nations, and is a member of many international organisations, including the World Health Organisation, and Unesco. There is a big world out there, and as Winnie Ewing, who served in the EU, Scottish and UK parliaments, and who celebrated her th birthday last week, famously remarked \"Stop the world, Scotland wants to get on\".Ruth Marr, Stirling.JACOB Rees-Moggrsquos crass comment on Twitter that ldquowe clearly donrsquot need Europe to win in reference to Englandrsquos win in the Cricket World Cup has backfired spectacularly given the international make-up of the team.The -man squad includes five players born outside the UK, including the Irish-born captain, Eoin Morgan. Tom Curran and Jason Roy are originally from South Africa, while Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer, who bowled the super over, were born in New Zealand and Barbados respectively. In addition, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid are the grandchildren of Pakistani immigrants and both belong to the Mirpuri community.So, the team was captained by an immigrant, with batting led by an immigrant, the fastest bowler an immigrant, the leading all-rounder was an immigrant and the main spinner son of an immigrant.Perhaps instead of making a silly Brextremist point Mr Mogg could have offered congratulations to the Irish captain, the New Zealand-born Man of the Match and the Barbadian bowler who got England over the line.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH."},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sports centre serves up an ace with new tennis plans","story":"With the nation currently hooked on Wimbledon, it#s a fitting time for Garioch Sports Centre to unveil its new tennis-focused proposals.Inverurie Community Council has submitted fresh expansion plans to Aberdeenshire Council on behalf of Garioch Sports Holdings.Full planning permission was secured last year for a major extension of the Inverurie facility, but changes in the community’s requirements and pressures on funding have prompted a reduced development.Initially the plans would have seen the Burghmuir Drive centre expanding into one of the largest amenities of its kind in Scotland, incorporating tennis courts, a multi-sports arena, fitness suites and an all-weather G pitch for Inverurie Loco Works FC which has now been dropped.But while the scale of the expansion might not be as ambitious, the new plans do reveal tennis courts and improvements for fitness along with an Early Learning Centre for younger children.Thanks to signicant input from Judy Murray – mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie – the plans feature three dedicated tennis courts and the centre has committed to a three-year partnership with the JM Foundation, highlighting the commitment of the centre to develop the sport across Garioch.The centre and JM Foundation will work in partnership in upskilling their workforce and identying potential coaches while funding coach education.In a supporting statement the centre writes: “The matter of securing the appropriate funding for the ious options which have been considered over the last couple of years has impacted upon how the plans have altered with the focus very much now being on the new tennis provision.“The most recent plans reflect the discussions with the Lawn Tennis Association and also Tennis Scotland.“The advice and guidance of Judy Murray has also been pivotal in how the plans particularly for the tennis courts have progressed.”The applicants also believe that despite the downturn in oil and gas and other industries, there is still a demand for its facilities.It reports: “As many of the activities and programmes now carry waiting lists, there is proof that despite a downturn in many industries the timing is now right to expand in tandem with the growth in participation and the increase in the town and rural residency.“An expansion of the present facility and delivery of its sporting, health and wellbeing activities has many positive additions as the market town itself strives to increase its provision to its residents.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Turing, lauded nowadays as a war hero and the father of computer science, was prosecuted just seven years after the end of the conflict on account of his homosexuality.Now  years after his death, he is set to grace the new polymer note that is expected to enter circulation by the end of . It will feature a quote from Turing, given in an interview to the Times newspaper on  June , in which he vowed: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come and only the shadow of what is going to be.”James Turing, the founder and chief executive of the Turing Trust, an Edinburgh-based charity that continues his great uncle’s legacy by providing reused computer and teacher training in sub-Saharan Africa, said it was important to qualy the honour.He told The Scotsman: “The new £ note is a wonderful dedication to Alan and his legacy and something that on a personal level is quite surreal. However, it doesn’t change how Alan was treated during his le, so my hope for this dedication is that it will help to remind us all that we must do better and strive daily to make the world a more tolerant and equal place.”Turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts in . An inquest concluded his death from cyanide poisoning two years later at the age of just  was suicide.He was posthumously pardoned by the Queen in , having been convicted of gross indecency. The new banknote design will feature a photograph of him taken in , as well as a table and mathematical formulae from a  paper by Turing, which is widely recognised as being a foundation for computer science.It sought to establish whether there could be a definitive method by which something could be assessed as provable or not using a universal machine.The design will also feature technical drawings for the British Bombe – one of the main methods used to break Enigma-enciphered messages during the war.Turing’s signature from the visitors’ book at Bletchley Park in , where he worked during the war, will also be included, alongside ticker tape depicting his birth date –  June  – in binary code, a concept which featured in Turing’s groundbreaking  paper.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"here s how you can say no to boris yes to europe stephen gethins","story":"The #people# need to show their #will# at the #No to Boris, Yes to Europe# demonstration in London on Saturday  July, writes Stephen Gethins.Within days, the UK will have a new Prime Minister. He will be the most viscerally anti-EU this country has known. Britain has already become a global laughing stock, but with Johnson in charge, it will be dangerously so. We need to register our protest, and fast.A demonstration is planned for London on  July – No to Johnson, yes to Europe. That pretty much sums up the views of the vast majority of people in Scotland. Our nation voted overwhelmingly remain, and our decision must be respected. Johnson’s elevation to leader is the result of more than  years of planning, which has included a host of untruths and inventions, as journalist then politician. More recently, it is the culmination of three years of scheming, in which he became the poster boy for a Leave campaign that adopted the most hysterical and specious claims.Since then, the anti-Europeans and the recently convertedhave claimed that Brexit is the will of the people. But is it  It certainly isn’t the will of the people of Scotland, or Northern Ireland, where the Remain votes were far more decisive than the narrow  per cent UK-wide Leave vote.If they were so sure that now, with all the facts at their disposal, people south of the border would vote again to quit the EU, then why are they so scared to test the proposition  Because they know that, from the £ million per week for the NHS on the battle bus to other distortions, their claims would be rumbled.: Why Boris Johnson poses as big a threat to the Union as SNP – Lesley Laird: Journalist Boris Johnson discussed helping to have assaulted demands apologyThat was the past. The present is even more scary. Johnson will be voted in by . per cent of the population, a tiny rump of barely over , mainly elderly, white, male, diehard Conservative members, who seem to be quite prepared to pull up the drawbridge of opportunity for our children and grandchildren. As a recent YouGov survey pointed out, for many Tory activists, “delivering” Brexitmatters more than economic well-being.This Saturday might seem a strange time to hold a rally, but it comes three days before the announcement of the new prime minister. Imagine what message we would be sending outwe did nothing  If we sat on our hands and allowed the moment to happen without registering our alarm.Boris Johnson will move quickly, ordering civil servants to step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit. He will invite the EU to “negotiate” with him, even though they have said the Withdrawal Agreement was signed by both sides in good faith and cannot be amended. He will then harrumph in his inimitable style and head us to the clf edge. He will have the hardliners jump for joy, while many Tory moderateswill make allowances for him and go along with it all. Westminster should resume in September, but Johnson hasn’t ruled out shutting down Parliament in order to push through his catastrophic no-deal. Democracy is under threat.Last week’s disgraceful events, in which the UK’s Ambassador to the USA was forced to resign, is just a glimpse into the chaotic, dysal leadership we would have under Johnson. His record in office leaves a trail of diplomatic destruction and shows he is unfit for the office of Prime Minister.And what about the voters  The  July demo will be dferent from those that have gone before. This is the people sending a message to the powerful, not the other way round. They want to make the positive, passionate case for Europe, for the good it has done, the opportunities it provides – while also being mindful of changes that need to be made.They also want to express their frustration at the fact that while the UK Government has fixated on Brexit, it has failed to focus on the job they are supposed to be doing. Almost no legislation has been passed, no serious measures have been taken to improve living standards, while so much parliamentary time and energy has been devoted to the Brexit crisis.In March, we got a leline from the EU and extra time was granted to sort out this mess. We called for an urgent second EU referendum to take place, but instead the Tories have used the time to have an internal civil war. Parliament is not ing and the Government is crumbling. As the clock runs down to exit day in October, the threat of a no-deal hangs heavy over Scotland. We know it would be devastating and threaten up to , jobs. No government should be so reckless to consider this outcome, let alone actively promote it. We cannot solve the big global challenges such as the climate emergency, security threats and trade disputes when acting alone. That is why the SNP’s vision is of Scotland as a European nation. That is why we say Yes to Europe and No to Johnson.Stephen Gethins is SNP spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Europe in the House of Commons and MP for North-East Fe©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how a giant of labour s past can help scotland today richard leonard","story":"Affordable council and public housing will be a pillar of the next Scottish Labour Government#s plans, writes Richard Leonard.A new report by the Centre for Labour and Social Studiespublished last week, explores what it means to be ‘working class’. The report notes that  years have passed since the creation of the term, but it also reveals that over much of the th century, the lived experience of working people improved – a trend that has reversed in the past  years.I am often asked what – and who – I am referring to when I talk about the working class. The truth is, it is people from every ethnic background, British born or migrants, all genders, all sexualities, and people who live in every part of our country. Fundamentally, however, it is people who are paid for their labour, and as such I would say by this economic definition that the majority of people in Scotland are working class.The Class research highlights four common themes experienced by working people: precariousness, prejudice, power and place.Last week also marked the centenary of the first council housing introduced by the Liberals, although it was Labour’s  Housing Act led by John Wheatley, which heralded the real breakthrough. : This is what’s causing Edinburgh’s housing crisis – Professor Clf Hague: Here’s how we can end Scotland’s housing crisis – Tammy Swt-AdamsThis Act was the first legislation ever introduced by Labour in power aimed at transforming the lives of working people. With its -year plan for council house building funded by rising subsidies from central to local government, it stirred hope at a time of depression. Many of the great themes which guided Wheatley’s political le came together in the Housing Act. He was a socialist not because of books that he read but his personal experience of poverty. He nonetheless recognised the inspiring role of ideas and vision in politics. He also campaigned for a Living Wage and redistributive taxation, citing social inequality – “starving in the midst of plenty” – as the primary cause of economic slump. He understood the importance of practical socialism and he took his formative thinking in Glasgow and translated it into a national action plan. The aim of a Labour housing policy, Wheatley wrote, “is not to rescue people from the slums but to prevent them getting there”.Wheatley, who had been a Glasgow councillor prior to being a member of parliament, always understood that government – local or central – could provide the secure, affordable homes so needed. In his proposals for workmen’s cottages funded by the surpluses of the Glasgow Corporation Tramway Department, there is a more than a glimpse of the possibilities for a national council housing programme at affordable rents which he would later bring to fruition. Until the  Act’s subsidy provisions were withdrawn a decade later, more than half a million houses were built under its terms. A remarkable success.It is not surprising that a former councillor, with his le experience, focused on housing for the working class. Today,you speak to any local councillor and ask what is the most common topic that constituents raise: it is most likely to be housing.Affordable secure housing was part of the social justice improvement for working people and selling off council stock and not replacing it is part of the reversal. The result is that we now have a chronic shortage of affordable homes. Housing is taking up an ever-larger share of working people’s smaller pay packets.Young people particularly feel the negative impact of this reversal of fortunes, especially regarding housing. More young people are living in the private rented sector or with their parents due to the lack of affordable housing. Their employment is all too often that of low pay and insecure. Zero-hours contracts have grown exponentially. And children growing up in poverty are now more likely to have a parent working than not.For decades, we’ve been told that inequality doesn’t matter because the education system will allow talented and hard-working people to succeed whatever their background. But the greater inequality has become, the more entrenched it has become.Education is one of the most powerful means we have to overcome disadvantage. But our current system is mirroring and reinforcing the inequality in our society. The privileged remain privileged while people from working-class backgrounds are denied opportunities.The Scottish Parliament could be doing much more to address the challenges that people are experiencing. We need to build solidarity once again so a shared identity can emerge from shared conditions but also from shared values, a shared history of past struggles and of past victories, we must rebuild a willingness to support each other, and a sense of pride in and belonging to local neighbourhoods.The SNP Government has introduced a socio-economic duty on public bodies in Scotland to take account of equality issues such as gender, ethnicity, disability etc.But on class, the Government’s interim guidelines concluded: “This is, however, more dficult to measure and will require further consideration as to how we build it into assessment.” Too many working class people are still dying prematurely and poverty is often at the root of it. I want to eradicate poverty and inequality in Scotland. And making a long-term programme for affordable council and public housing to remove the experience of housing precariousness – just as John Wheatley did in  – will be one pillar of the next Scottish Labour Government’s objectives.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nan shepherd s masterpiece of nature writing is an inspiration leader comment","story":"Scotland and the rest of the world seem to be slowly waking up to Nan Shepherd and the wonder that she managed to find in Scotland#s mountains.Her book The Living Mountain was published in , more than  years after it was written, but despite the passage of time, this masterpiece of nature writing still has the power to inspire many of its readers.Now adventurer Elise Wortley plans to follow in Shepherd’s footsteps in the Cairngorms – dressed in tweed clothing, eating war-time rations and equipped with a wooden backpack and canvas tent. : Adventurer to follow in footsteps of trailblazing nature writer Nan ShepherdShe will climb the six highest Cairngorm peaks and spend a further  days “just living in the mountains” on a trip that will raise money for Scottish Women’s Aid.In this world of sometimes bewildering technology, there is much to be said for ing – at least occasionally – to a simpler time and seeking out the kind of tranquil joy that can be found in the simplicity and beauty of the natural world,not in person, then through the beautul descriptions of writers as skilled as Shepherd.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"adventurer to follow in footsteps of trailblazing nature writer nan shepherd","story":"Nearly eighty years after Nan Shepherd wrote her seminal and sensual exploration of the Cairngorms, a young adventurer will tomorrow begin to retrace her steps, using the same piecemeal provisions the author relied on. Shepherd, a modernist writer and poet who spent the majority of her working le as a teacher, wrote The Living Mountain in , only to keep the manuscript hidden away in a drawer for more than three decades. However, thanks to its publication by Canongate, the poetic, almost metaphysical meditation on her beloved Cairngorms is nowadays regarded as a cult classic.Nearly forty years after her death, Shepherd, a self-professed ldquopeerer into nooks and crannies, is regarded as one of Scotlandrsquos most important women writers - not least because of her foray into a genre traditionally dominated by men - and nowadays has pride of place on one of Royal Bank of Scotlands £ banknotes. For Elise Wortley, the discovery of Shepherdrsquos trailblazing journeys through the Cairngorms came at an opportune time in her le. Last year, the -year-old recreated part of Alexandra David-Neacuteels celebrated trek into India, an endeavour which saw her journey through the Himalayas for a month using no modern equipment. Kicking her heels over how to emulate the feat and shine a light on the neglected legacies of other empowering female adventurers, her mother recommended she read The Living Mountain to find some inspiration. Now, she is steeling herself to follow where Shepherd once travelled, and scale the six highest peaks of the Cairngorms in five days, before spending a further  days ldquojust living in the mountains as Nan would have. The aim, she says, is to raise awareness and celebrate a ldquogroundbreaking woman who never formed part of her lessons at school. In turn, she will raise money for Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, and hopes her adventure will inspire a new generation in the way Shepherd has motivated her. Ms Wortley, from London, told The Scotsman that when she first picked up a copy of The Living Mountain, she was spellbound and ldquotransported into Nanrsquos world. ldquoIt wasnrsquot what I was expecting. Itrsquos like one long poem, and the way she describes elements like water and a mountainrsquos plateau are just beautul, she recalled. ldquoShe was writing at a time when eastern religions were starting to have an influence in western le, and you can sense that otherworldly nature to it.ldquoI hope that by really immersing myself in the Cairngorms the way she did, I can understand what she was writing about a deeper level.True to Shepherdrsquos era, Ms Wortley will forego her smartphone and all other modern day comforts, and instead make do with a wooden backpack containing tweed clothing, war rations, and a canvas tent. It will, she hopes, be a transformative experience. ldquoYou get such an amazing sense of the place reading the book, but itrsquos important I think to be there with no distractions and try and unravel what it was she was feeling when she wrote it, and why she put it in a drawer for  years, she explained. ldquoShersquos someone who was overshadowed by her counterparts at the time, and so Irsquom really excited to go where she did and celebrate her achievements. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp minister accused of scaring the public over medicines shortage claim","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotlands Brexit Secretary has been accused of seeking to \"scare the public\" over his claim that medicines supplies cannot be guaranteedthe UK leaves the EU with no deal.Pharmaceutical chiefs haveeven warned that Mike Russells comments could spark panic buying among patients which could hit supplies.\u2028Mr Russell said yesterday that the supply of drugs could not be guaranteeda deal on the UKs departure was not struck with the EU.But Professor Ash Soni, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, today hit back at the SNP politicians claims.\u2028\"I think trying to scare the public is not a great thing to be doing at this moment in time,\" he told BBC Radio Scotlands Good Morning Scotland.\"We need the public to be working with us in making sure that we have full access to medicines.\"What we dont want is patients themselves starting to stockpile because that in itself will create a shortage in the market.\"If you think about the number of people that take certain medicines.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”.

I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal.

Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times.

Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector.

However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Mr. Herbinson, a member of the th Royal Irish Rles Association paid tribute at the last resting place of his great uncle Sgt Robert Herbinson who was killed in action on August ,  in the Ypres Salient.Sgt. Herbinson had survived the slaughter of the first day on the Somme where he had performed gallantly under fire and subsequently moved with the remainder of the thDivision to the British sector in Belgium. The th RIR Association were on their annual pilgrimage to the WW battlefields, taking part in the July  ceremonies on the Somme before visiting other sites. Editor’s note: Robert Herbinson was born at Clonavon, Ballymena and is buried at Ration Farm Cemetery Annexe, Ploegsteert, Belgium and commemorated in Wellington Street Presbyterian Church. Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland. He said they had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.“This is scandalous. It is an indictment of the Northern Ireland Office and of this government,\" he said.“We have lost all sense of reality when a portrait of Her Majesty can cause offence to a civil servant but we do not bat an eyelid when we deny closure and justice to unfortunate people who have been abused in the most outrageous manner imaginable.“I urge the Northern Ireland Office not only to restore the original portraits of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh but to expedite payment of the comparatively paltry compensation due to the people who are more deserving than this opportunistic civil servant who, surely, must now be compromised in his position in the Parades Commission because of his bigoted stance over the Royal Family.”The Northern Ireland Office said in a statement: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former ira bombers group to get proceeds from lyra mckee book","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ms McKee was shot dead by a New IRA gunman during rioting in Londonderry in April.As per Lyras swishes, some of the money from the book will go to Paper Trail, which works closely with human rights and victims groups that represent families affected by the conflict.The organisation is registered with the Charity Commission and Companies House, and lists Mr McClenaghan as being on the charity trustee board and being a company director. Paper Trails activities are funded by the EUs Peace IV programme.  Mr McClenaghan revealed in a  documentary that he was \"immensely proud\" of joining the IRA and said it was his \"daily job\" to plant bombs around Belfast. As a result of the admission Jackie Nicholl resigned from the forum after he was made aware of Mr McClenaghans past. Mr Nicholls -month-old son was killed in a no-warning IRA bomb on the Shankill Road in . Mr McClenaghans grandfather Philip Garry was killed in the McGurks bar bomb in , and he was appointed to the Victims and Survivors Forum in .  data-dfpadtargetingRobert McClenaghanTribute: Lyra McKeeSpeaking to the News Letter, Mr McClenaghan said he was not sorry for his actions as an IRA bomber and did not believe they were wrong.\"But that was when I was a child. That was when I was a teenager,\" he said. \"That was when I was growing up in the middle of the conflict.“Now I’m trying to go in a dferent direction by promoting peace, reconciliation and trying to bring together people. That’s what we do. That’s what Paper Trail does.”Mr McClenaghan told the newspaper that he believes the \"Orange State\" had to be destroyed by armed action.“I believe the Orange state was never going to give up its power and privilege and the whole sectarianism they perpetrated for  years before they were brought down in ,\" he said.  \"So you had to destroy the Orange state in my opinion.”Asked whether that task could only be accomplished by bombs, guns and killing people, he replied: “Unfortunately yes. It had to be destroyed. There’s no easy way. But that was in the ‘s. Now we’re in a completely dferent era politically, where you don’t need any type of violence from any quarter and specically the group who killed Lyra.”He said the dference between the killing of Ms McKee and the actions of the Provisional IRA was that there is was now a \"political alternative\".\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A new mural of Lyra McKee in Belfast city centre Askedit was ironic that proceeds from the work of Lyra McKee will go to a group he is helping to run, he said: \"She was a lovely human being. So to try and reduce it down to what you’re trying to say now I think it’s very disrespectful to Lyra’s memory.“In the sense that you’re trying to make a point that Lyra would somehow disagree with my background. And she wouldn’t. She didn’t. We got on very well ... Lyra was a person who would understand people. I don’t think you can.”Ciaran MacAirt, secretary of Paper Trail, told the News Letter that Ms McKee had supported the organisation \"at every stage\", helped launch its research and pilot group and sat on a steering group for the charity. He said he was \"humbled\" Paper Trail will get proceeds from her work. Concerning Mr McClenaghan, Mr MacAirt said: “I work with people who have wide-ranging beliefs, personal opinions and past experiences.

When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"operation motorman findings seamus bradley inquest made public next month","story":"The Inquest findings into one of the most controversial killings of the Troubles in Derry will be made public next month, the Derry News can reveal.Seamus Bradley was shot dead in highly disputed circumstances by the British Army during Operation Motorman in the early hours of July , .The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland has now confirmed that the findings of the Inquest will be announced by Judge Patrick Kinney on August  at Laganside Court in Belfast. The Inquest hearings took place over a twelve-day period last year.The British Army have claimed for the last  years, that Mr Bradley a -year-old IRA member, was armed when they opened fire on him close to the Bishop’s Field area of Creggan. This claim has consistently denied by the Bradley family over the decades.Danny Bradley, brother of the deceased man told the Derry News: “At the end of the day this is good news. It has taken  years and caused a lot of hurt for so long.“I am hoping that the findings will come out the way that we want it and we will be travelling together as family to Belfast next month to hear the outcome.“It destroyed our family, but I had to get the answer about what happened and I am certainly looking forward to that.

His cousin Christopher Hegarty was also struck in the head by a round fired by the same soldier but survived the shooting. Soldier B, the man responsible for both incidents will also face a charge of wounding with intent in relation to Christopher Hegarty.The decision to prosecute the soldier represented the reversal of a decision taken in  not to prefer charges against the former British serviceman. That decision was however overturned after a Divisional Court ruling last year.Previous decisions not to prosecute in the Hegarty case were taken in  after the original Inquest and again in  following a review of the case by the former Historical Enquiries Team.Announcing the decision in relation to the Hegarty case, Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: “I have given careful consideration to all of the available evidence. This has included material obtained in the course of the initial investigation by a later investigation carried out by the Historical Enquiries Team material generated by Inquest proceedings and a number of forensic reports-the most recent of which was provided after the Court ruling in .“I have concluded that the evidence which can be presented at court is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and the Evidential Test for Prosecution is met.”Nine people also died in Claudy on July ,  as three car bombs tore through the heart of the County Derry village.CAPTION: -year-old Seamus Bradley who was killed by the British Army on July , . "},{"url":null,"title":"scrapped bogside parking scheme blocks roll areas","story":"A Derry MLA has criticised a government department for its failure to deliver a Bogside residents’ parking scheme over the past decade.The comments made by SDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment. This is something I and many others are looking forward to..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new family walking trail opens at Saul  ","story":"A NEW walking trail for all the family to enjoy has been opened in Saul.The Saul Family Trail was officially opened last Wednesday by Newry Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Just under km in , the new route is at Saul GAC, which was behind the project.Club officials attended last weekrsquos launch and along with representatives of ious support organisations and members of the local community.Saul GAC is located at the foot of Slieve Patrick, a popular walking area for locals and tourists alike due to its beauty and historic interest.The current walking routes around the mountain are quite challenging and are not suitable for all levels of ability.The new trail is fully accessible to allow and encourage everyone to participate in outdoor activities.It offers Saul and Raholp a hub from which local people and visitors can enjoy the beauty of the local environment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

John Healy, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said “we should be heartened by the fact that our politicians are apparently talking” but after two years without movement of any kind “we shouldn’t expect results in a hurry”. “Nevertheless, they mustn’t waste time.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives. Shane Mulholland, senior vice president of marketing and operations at First Derivatives, said: “We’ve been involved with the Fast  programme since it began and have found it to be not only great recognition of every stage of the company’s growth but also a chance to meet peers and like-minded businesses who are striving to be leaders in their own fields.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/brexit_123234324234_web.jpg","title":"no deal brexit could cost ni  jobs","story":"Posted on Wednesday  July  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland faces losing , jobs in a ‘no deal’ Brexit which could have ‘immediate and severe consequences for its position as an all-island and UK economy, a government paper has warned.

Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%.
